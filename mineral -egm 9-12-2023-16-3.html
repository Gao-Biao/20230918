The patients were diagnosed as having bipolar depression (97), unipolar depression (54), cycloid psychosis (21), schizoaffective psychosis and depressive neurosis (42). Sixty patients were treated with lithium salt only, 73 patients received neuroleptic drugs in addition to lithium and 51 antidepressant drugs. Sixteen patients were treated with a combination of neuroleptic drugs, antidepressant drugs and lithium. Fourteen patients were treated with lithium and benzodiazepines. The aim of this retrospective lithium study was to examine the renal function in these different treatment groups. The results show that patients treated with a lithium salt and neuroleptic drugs have significantly lower urinary osmolality than those treated with a lithium salt only. Also tricyclic antidepressants in combination with a lithium salt appear to have an influence on renal function. The duration of concomitant therapy seems to be of importance for the effect on renal function. Eleven patients with the lowest osmolality values were investigated at the Renal Unit, Danderyd Hospital, but in no case was it necessary to withdraw the lithium treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aberg-Wistedt A ; Elwin CE ; Norée LO ; Wistedt B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00004850-198810000-00001 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAnti-Anxiety Agents/administration & dosage\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/administration & dosage\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage\r\nBenzodiazepines\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nKidney/*drug effects/physiopathology\r\nKidney Function Tests\r\nLithium/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychotic Disorders/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nTime Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aberg-Wistedt A, Elwin CE, Norée LO, and Wistedt B (1988) Lithium and renal function in relation to concomitant theory..

METHOD: Retrospective chart review of the cognitive function of 29 patients receiving maintenance lithium treatment attending the Dublin South East Old Age Psychiatry service, over a nine-year time period. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were included in the study (20 female, nine males), with a mean age of 79 years. Two patients had concurrent dementia. Six patients fulfilled ICD10 criteria for mild cognitive disorder and all of these patients also fulfilled revised consensus criteria for mild cognitive impairment amnestic subtype. Sixteen patients were commenced on lithium as an augmentation treatment for recurrent depressive disorder, 12 patients were on treatment for bipolar affective disorder and one patient on treatment for schizoaffective disorder. Patients had been receiving lithium treatment for an average of 109 months with follow-up by the service for a mean duration of 38 months. The initial mean MMSE score of patients at first presentation to the service was 26.9 (SD = 5.6) compared to a mean MMSE score 25.8 (SD = 5.8) (CI of change in MMSE score at 95% level = -2.1 and 0) at follow-up. The mean MMSE of patients with mild cognitive impairment prior at first contact with the service was 26.8 (SD = 3.2) and at follow-up was 26 (SD = 3.2) which was not statistically significantly different (p=0.40) (CI for change in MMSE at 95% level = -3.2 to 1.5). No patient had developed incident dementia during the follow-up period of the study. CONCLUSION: The results tentatively suggest that lithium may have a protective effect against cognitive decline and a neuroprotective role in patients with concurrent affective disorder and cognitive impairment. Multi-centre prospective studies of cognitive function in patients attending lithium clinics are needed to examine the neuroprotective properties of lithium.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Abidin Z ; Cooney C ; Jackson D ; Freyne A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S0790966700012143 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Abidin Z, Cooney C, Jackson D, and Freyne A (2011) Lithium and prevention of cognitive impairment..

METHODS: In this trial, the 108 obese women with mild to moderate depressive symptoms were randomly allocated into 4 groups: (1) co- supplementation group (n = 27): receiving a 50000 IU vitamin D soft gel weekly + a 250- mg magnesium tablet daily; (2) vitamin D group (n = 27): receiving a 50000 IU vitamin D soft gel weekly + a magnesium placebo daily; (3) magnesium group (n = 27): receiving a vitamin D placebo weekly + a 250- mg magnesium tablet daily; (4) control group (n = 27): receiving a vitamin D placebo weekly + a magnesium placebo daily, for 8 weeks. Before and after the intervention, anthropometric indices, depressive symptoms, serum levels of BDNF, 25(OH)-D, inflammation, and SIRT1, were measured. RESULTS: At the end of the study, ANCOVA demonstrated significant differences between the 4 groups in 25(OH)-D, magnesium, TNF-α, IL-6, and BDNF levels. But, we found no significant differences in terms of hs-CRP and SIRT1 levels. A significant reduction in depression score was observed in 3 intervention groups and also in control group.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have become the drugs of choice in the treatment of depression, and they are also effective in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and social phobia. New indications for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors include post-traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Extended-release venlafaxine has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. Mirtazapine, which is unrelated to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, is unique in its action--stimulating the release of norepinephrine and serotonin. The choice of antidepressant drug depends on the agent's pharmacologic profile, secondary actions, and tolerability. Sexual dysfunction related to the use of antidepressants may be addressed by reducing the dosage, switching to another agent, or adding another drug to overcome the sexual side effects. Augmentation with lithium or triiodothyronine may be useful in patients who are partially or totally resistant to antidepressant treatment. Finally, tapering antidepressant medication may help to avoid discontinuation syndrome or antidepressant withdrawal.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ables AZ ; Baughman OL 3rd; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nHumans\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nSexual Dysfunction, Physiological/chemically induced\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/etiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ables AZ, and Baughman OL 3rd (2003) Antidepressants: update on new agents and indications..

Whilst there are established, effective and cost-effective treatments for depression, their long-term management is often neglected: there is continuing controversy over the case of need for long-term treatment including lifelong treatment and safety issues. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: In this narrative review, we critically examine the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of lithium salts in the long-term management of unipolar depression. We refer to existing recent international guidelines as well as the scientific literature selectively and against the background of our longstanding experience with patients suffering from unipolar depression who are often under treated or inappropriately treated. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: According to many studies mostly dating back to the 1970/1980s, lithium is efficacious in the prophylaxis of unipolar depression particularly depression with melancholia and delusional depression and showing a clearly episodic course. Also the efficacy of lithium maintenance treatment following recovery by ECT has been clearly shown. Moreover, convincing evidence exists that lithium has added value and benefit for its unique anti-suicidal effects as well as reducing mortality by other causes. The anti-suicidal effect has been convincingly demonstrated in bipolar as well as in unipolar patients. Nevertheless its use in the management of patients with unipolar depression has not been properly recognized by a majority of textbooks and guidelines. Whilst it has been well considered as an effective treatment for depression that has not responded to antidepressants as an adjunct treatment, also called augmentation, it has been much less recommended for the prevention of recurrent episodes of unipolar depression. One of the reasons for this neglect is the blurring of the diagnosis \"unipolar depression\" by modern diagnostic tools. Lithium will hardly work in a patient with \"unipolar depression spectrum disease\". CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that lithium is an effective prophylactic treatment for carefully selected patients with unipolar depression and is safe when prescribed in recommended doses/plasma lithium levels and with regular, careful monitoring. We propose that lithium prophylaxis can be indicated in patients with unipolar depression and that the occurrence of 2 episodes of depression within 5 years is a practical criterion for starting lithium prophylaxis particularly in severe depression with psychotic features and high suicidal risk. Furthermore, an indication might be considered especially in unipolar patients in whom a bipolar background is suspected. In some cases, lithium prophylaxis may be recommended after a single episode of depression that is severe with high suicidal risk and continued life-long.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Abou-Saleh MT ; Müller-Oerlinghausen B ; Coppen AJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s40345-017-0080-x ","Keywords":"Antisuicidal effect\r\nAugmentation\r\nECT\r\nLithium\r\nLong-term-prophylaxis\r\nUnipolar depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Abou-Saleh MT, Müller-Oerlinghausen B, and Coppen AJ (2017) Lithium in the episode and suicide prophylaxis and in augmenting strategies in patients with unipolar depression..

We are reporting on the first of 3 subsequent study phases evaluating effectiveness and feasibility of the SSTR in a naturalistic clinical setting. METHOD: Patients with depressive disorders (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision criteria) admitted to an academic medical center for inpatient treatment were enrolled in the SSTR protocol that comprised an algorithm-guided sequential treatment process (including pharmacologic washout period, sleep deprivation, antidepressant monotherapy, lithium augmentation, monoamine oxidase inhibitor treatment, and electroconvulsive therapy) dependent on the scores of a standardized assessment of treatment outcome, the Bech Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale (BRMS). RESULTS: Of 248 patients with depression, 119 (48%) were enrolled in the SSTR protocol. One hundred twenty-nine patients (52%) were not included, mostly due to individualized treatment procedures. An intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed that 38% of enrolled patients achieved remission (BRMS score < or = 5), 34% achieved \"classic\" response (deltaBRMS score > or = 50%), 15% achieved \"low\" response (deltaBRMS score 26% to 49%), and 13% did not respond. The overall response rate (remitters and classic responders) of SSTR treatment was 72% of the ITT sample. Twenty-one patients (18%) dropped out from the SSTR as nonresponders and 19 patients (16%) dropped out as low responders due to protocol deviations. CONCLUSION: The acceptance of the antidepressive treatment algorithm among physicians not specifically trained was moderate, resulting in a relatively low enrollment rate. However, once patients were enrolled into the study, adherence to the algorithm-based rules resulted in a low dropout rate. Most importantly, algorithm-guided antidepressive treatment showed a favorable response in those depressed patients who were treated according to the SSTR protocol.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Adli M ; Berghöfer A ; Linden M ; Helmchen H ; Müller-Oerlinghausen B ; Mackert A ; Stamm T ; Bauer M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/jcp.v63n0906 ","Keywords":"*Algorithms\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Clinical Protocols/standards\r\nDepressive Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/therapy\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nFeasibility Studies\r\nFemale\r\n*Hospitalization\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/therapeutic use\r\nOutcome Assessment, Health Care/statistics & numerical data\r\nPatient Dropouts\r\nPilot Projects\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nResearch Design/statistics & numerical data\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Adli M, Berghöfer A, Linden M, Helmchen H, Müller-Oerlinghausen B, Mackert A, Stamm T, and Bauer M (2002) Effectiveness and feasibility of a standardized stepwise drug treatment regimen algorithm for inpatients with depressive disorders: results of a 2-year observational algorithm study..

We investigated long-term outcomes of unipolar depressed patients who had participated in a study on the effects of lithium augmentation on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system using the combined dexamethasone/corticotrophin-releasing hormone (DEX/CRH) test. METHODS: Twelve to 28 months (mean 18.6 +/- 4.6 months) after lithium augmentation, 23 patients were assessed with a standardized interview, of which 18 patients had complete DEX/CRH test results. Relapse was diagnosed by DSM-IV criteria (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV; SCID I). RESULTS: Only 11 patients (48%) had a favorable follow-up, defined as absence of major depressive episodes during the observation period. Patients with a favorable and an unfavorable course did not differ in clinical or sociodemographic parameters, endocrinological results or continuation of lithium. However, fewer previous depressive episodes tended to correlate (p = 0.09) with a favorable course. CONCLUSION: Results from studies using the DEX/CRH test to predict relapse in depressed patients treated with antidepressants were not replicated for lithium augmentation. Our finding could reflect the elevation of DEX/CRH results by lithium, independent of clinical course. Limitations of the study are its small sample size, the heterogeneous clinical baseline conditions and the lack of lithium serum levels. The fact that lithium continuation did not predict the course might be related to the difference between the efficacy of lithium in controlled studies and its effectiveness in naturalistic settings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Adli M ; Bschor T ; Bauer M ; Lucka C ; Lewitzka U ; Ising M ; Uhr M ; Mueller-Oerlinghausen B ; Baethge C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000234814 ","Keywords":"Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/metabolism\r\nCorticotropin-Releasing Hormone/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDexamethasone/pharmacology\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nGlucocorticoids/pharmacology\r\nHumans\r\nHydrocortisone/metabolism\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*drug effects/physiopathology\r\nLithium/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System/*drug effects\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/*pharmacology\r\nRecurrence\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Adli M, Bschor T, Bauer M, Lucka C, Lewitzka U, Ising M, Uhr M, Mueller-Oerlinghausen B, and Baethge C (2009) Long-term outcome after lithium augmentation in unipolar depression: focus on HPA system activity..

This is the first randomized controlled study to evaluate the clinical effect of algorithm-guided treatment in inpatients with major depressive disorder. METHODS: Inpatients, aged 18 to 70 years with major depressive disorder from 10 German psychiatric departments were randomized to 5 different treatment arms (from 2000 to 2005), 3 of which were standardized stepwise drug treatment algorithms (ALGO). The fourth arm proposed medications and provided less specific recommendations based on a computerized documentation and expert system (CDES), the fifth arm received treatment as usual (TAU). ALGO included 3 different second-step strategies: lithium augmentation (ALGO LA), antidepressant dose-escalation (ALGO DE), and switch to a different antidepressant (ALGO SW). Time to remission (21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ≤9) was the primary outcome. RESULTS: Time to remission was significantly shorter for ALGO DE (n=91) compared with both TAU (n=84) (HR=1.67; P=.014) and CDES (n=79) (HR=1.59; P=.031) and ALGO SW (n=89) compared with both TAU (HR=1.64; P=.018) and CDES (HR=1.56; P=.038). For both ALGO LA (n=86) and ALGO DE, fewer antidepressant medications were needed to achieve remission than for CDES or TAU (P<.001). Remission rates at discharge differed across groups; ALGO DE had the highest (89.2%) and TAU the lowest rates (66.2%). CONCLUSIONS: A highly structured algorithm-guided treatment is associated with shorter times and fewer medication changes to achieve remission with depressed inpatients than treatment as usual or computerized medication choice guidance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Adli M ; Wiethoff K ; Baghai TC ; Fisher R ; Seemüller F ; Laakmann G ; Brieger P ; Cordes J ; Malevani J ; Laux G ; Hauth I ; Möller HJ ; Kronmüller KT ; Smolka MN ; Schlattmann P ; Berger M ; Ricken R ; Stamm TJ ; Heinz A ; Bauer M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/ijnp/pyx043 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\n*Algorithms\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nGermany\r\nGuidelines as Topic/*standards\r\nHumans\r\n*Inpatients\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\n*Treatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult\r\nGerman Algorithm Project\r\nantidepressants\r\nmedical decision making\r\ntreatment algorithms\r\ntreatment-resistant depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Adli M, Wiethoff K, Baghai TC, Fisher R, Seemüller F, Laakmann G, Brieger P, Cordes J, Malevani J, Laux G, Hauth I, Möller HJ, Kronmüller KT, Smolka MN, Schlattmann P, Berger M, Ricken R, Stamm TJ, Heinz A, and Bauer M (2017) How Effective Is Algorithm-Guided Treatment for Depressed Inpatients?

Recent developments relevant to geriatric psychiatry have focused on Alzheimer's disease (AD), severe/refractory depression, and cancer/end of life care. AREAS COVERED: This is a non-systematic, narrative review (databases and websites for search: PubMed, Google Scholar, Medscape, ClinicalTrials.gov; focusing on the last 6 years), and covers developments in disease-modifying therapies for AD, diagnostic radiotracers for AD, medications for neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia, ketamine/esketamine, psychedelics, and cannabinoids. EXPERT OPINION: The focus of on-going trials of anti-amyloid agents has been on individuals with very early stage AD; several agents are under phase 3 investigation, and aducanumab is under FDA review. Amyloid and tau PET scans have been approved by the FDA to assist in the diagnoses of AD. Promising pharmaceuticals for neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia include pimavanserin, brexpiprazole, escitalopram, dextromethorphan/quinidine, and lithium. Esketamine, although approved for treatment-resistant depression in general adults, failed to demonstrate efficacy in elderly patients in a phase 3 trial. There is preliminary evidence for benefit of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy in end-of-life and cancer-related depression/anxiety. Evidence for the use of cannabinoids is currently lacking.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aftab A ; Lam JA ; Liu F ; Ghosh A ; Sajatovic M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/17512433.2021.1882848 ","Keywords":"Age Factors\r\nAged\r\nAlzheimer Disease/drug therapy/psychology\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nNeoplasms/drug therapy/psychology\r\nPsychopharmacology\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use\r\nTerminal Care/methods\r\nAlzheimer’s disease\r\nGeriatric psychiatry\r\nanti-amyloid agents\r\ncannabinoids\r\ndementia\r\ndiagnostic radiotracers\r\nesketamine\r\nneuropsychiatric symptoms\r\npsychedelics\r\npsychopharmacology\r\ntreatment-resistant depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aftab A, Lam JA, Liu F, Ghosh A, and Sajatovic M (2021) Recent developments in geriatric psychopharmacology..

This article reports the results and most relevant conclusions of a Delphi-based consensus on geriatric depression promoted by the Spanish Psychogeriatric Association. METHODS: A 78-item questionnaire was developed by 7 highly specialized geriatric psychiatrists and was evaluated using the Modified Delphi technique in two rounds answered by 35 psychiatrists with an extensive expertise in geriatric depression. The topics and number of questions (in brackets) covered were: concepts, clinical aspects, and risk factors (12); screening and diagnosis (7); psychotic depression (17); depression and dementia (5); antidepressant drug treatment (18); non-pharmacological biological treatments (5); psychotherapeutic treatments (4); comorbidity and preventive aspects (6); professional training needed (4). In addition, the expert panel's opinion on the antidepressants of choice in 21 common comorbid conditions and on different strategies to approach treatment-resistant cases in terms of both efficacy and safety was assessed. RESULTS: After the two rounds of the Delphi process, consensus was reached for 59 (75.6%) of the 78 items. Detailed recommendations are included in the text. Considering pharmacological treatments, agomelatine was the most widely mentioned drug to be recommended in terms of safety in comorbid conditions. Desvenlafaxine, sertraline, and vortioxetine, were the most frequently recommended antidepressants in comorbid conditions in general. Combining parameters of efficacy and safety, experts recommended the following steps to address cases of treatment resistance: 1. Escalation to the maximum tolerated dose; 2. Change of antidepressant; 3. Combination with another antidepressant; 4. Potentiation with an antipsychotic or with lamotrigine; 5. Potentiation with lithium; 6. Potentiation with dopamine agonists or methylphenidate. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Consensus was reached for a high number of items as well as for the management of depression in the context of comorbid conditions and in resistant cases. In the current absence of sufficient evidence-based information, our results can be used to inform medical doctors about clinical recommendations that might reduce uncertainty in the diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients with depressive disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Agüera-Ortiz L ; Claver-Martín MD ; Franco-Fernández MD ; López-Álvarez J ; Martín-Carrasco M ; Ramos-García MI ; Sánchez-Pérez M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00380 ","Keywords":"antidepressant drugs\r\nclinical recommendations\r\ncomorbidity\r\nconsensus statement\r\ndepression\r\nelderly\r\ntreatment-resistance","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Agüera-Ortiz L, Claver-Martín MD, Franco-Fernández MD, López-Álvarez J, Martín-Carrasco M, Ramos-García MI, and Sánchez-Pérez M (2020) Depression in the Elderly.

Therefore, this work was aimed at evaluating the combined effect of subacute prophylactic zinc administration and swimming exercise in a transient cerebral ischemia model. The prophylactic zinc administration (2.5 mg/kg of body weight) was provided every 24 h for four days before a 30 min common carotid artery occlusion (CCAO), and 24 h after reperfusion, the rats were subjected to swimming exercise in the Morris Water Maze (MWM). Learning was evaluated daily for five days, and memory on day 12 postreperfusion; anxiety or depression-like behavior was measured by the elevated plus maze and the motor activity by open-field test. Nitrites, lipid peroxidation, and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were assessed in the temporoparietal cortex and hippocampus. The three nitric oxide (NO) synthase isoforms, chemokines, and their receptor levels were measured by ELISA. Nissl staining evaluated hippocampus cytoarchitecture and Iba-1 immunohistochemistry activated the microglia. Swimming exercise alone could not prevent ischemic damage but, combined with prophylactic zinc administration, reversed the cognitive deficit, decreased NOS and chemokine levels, prevented tissue damage, and increased Iba-1 (+) cell number. These results suggest that the subacute prophylactic zinc administration combined with swimming exercise, but not the individual treatment, prevents the ischemic damage on day 12 postreperfusion in the transient ischemia model.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aguilar-Peralta AK ; Gonzalez-Vazquez A ; Tomas-Sanchez C ; Blanco-Alvarez VM ; Martinez-Fong D ; Gonzalez-Barrios JA ; Limon ID ; Millán-Perez Peña L; Flores G ; Soto-Rodriguez G ; Brambila E ; Cebada J ; Vargas-Castro V ; Leon-Chavez BA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1155/2022/5388944 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nCognition\r\nIschemia\r\nMaze Learning\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\n*Swimming\r\n*Zinc/pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aguilar-Peralta AK, Gonzalez-Vazquez A, Tomas-Sanchez C, Blanco-Alvarez VM, Martinez-Fong D, Gonzalez-Barrios JA, Limon ID, Millán-Perez Peña L, Flores G, Soto-Rodriguez G, Brambila E, Cebada J, Vargas-Castro V, and Leon-Chavez BA (2022) Prophylactic Zinc Administration Combined with Swimming Exercise Prevents Cognitive-Emotional Disturbances and Tissue Injury following a Transient Hypoxic-Ischemic Insult in the Rat..

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein is one of the neuropathological hallmarks, and Tau pathology correlates better with cognitive impairments in AD patients than amyloid-β load, supporting a key role of tau-related mechanisms. Selenium is a non-metallic trace element that is incorporated in the brain into selenoproteins. Chronic treatment with sodium selenate, a non-toxic selenium compound, was recently reported to rescue behavioral phenotypes in tau mouse models. Here, we focused on the effects of chronic selenate application on synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in THY-Tau22 mice, a transgenic animal model of tauopathies. Three months with a supplement of sodium selenate in the drinking water (12 μg/ml) restored not only impaired neurocognitive functions but also rescued long-term depression (LTD), a major form of synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, selenate reduced the inactive demethylated catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in THY-Tau22 without affecting total PP2A.Our study provides evidence that chronic dietary selenate rescues functional synaptic deficits of tauopathy and identifies activation of PP2A as the putative mechanism.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ahmed T ; Van der Jeugd A ; Caillierez R ; Buée L ; Blum D ; D'Hooge R ; Balschun D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fnmol.2020.570223 ","Keywords":"Alzheimer’s disease\r\nchronic oral treatment\r\nlong-term depression\r\nneurocognitive functions\r\nprotein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)\r\nsynaptic plasticity\r\nsynaptic transmission\r\ntau hyperphosphorylation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ahmed T, Van der Jeugd A, Caillierez R, Buée L, Blum D, D'Hooge R, and Balschun D (2020) Chronic Sodium Selenate Treatment Restores Deficits in Cognition and Synaptic Plasticity in a Murine Model of Tauopathy..

Several lines of evidence suggest that serotonin is likely to play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. Ritanserin, a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, has been reported to have antipsychotic activity. In this 6-week double blind, placebo controlled study involving moderate to severe manic patients, we assessed the effects of ritanserin plus haloperidol in combination with lithium. METHODS: 45 patients aged between 21-43 were eligible to participate as they met the DSM-IV criteria for a current manic episode, on the basis of a clinical interview by an academician psychiatrist. In addition, a score of at least 20 points on the Young Mania rating Scale was required representing moderate to severe mania. Patients were randomly allocated lithium (1-1.2 mEq/L) + haloperidol (10 mg/day)+ ritanserin (10 mg/day) (Group A) or lithium (1-1.2 mEq/L)+ haloperidol (10 mg/day) + placebo (Group B) for a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were assessed by a third year psychiatry resident at baseline and 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 days after the medication started. All patients entered the hospital were not previously under any medication. The mean decrease in the Young Mania Rating Scale score from baseline was used as the main outcome measure of response of mania to treatment. The extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed using the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale. Side effects were systematically recorded throughout the study and were assessed using a checklist. RESULTS: Young Mania Rating Scale total scores improved with ritanserin. The difference between the two protocols was significant as indicated by the effect of group and the between-subjects factor (F = 5.02, d.f. = 1, P = 0.03). The means Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale scores for the placebo group were higher than the ritanserin group and the difference was significant in day 42. The difference between the two groups in the frequency of side effects was not significant CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of ritanserin to obtain a better improvement in patients with mania seems to support the 5-HT hypothesis of bipolar disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Akhondzadeh S ; Mohajari H ; Reza Mohammadi M; Amini H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1471-244X-3-7 ","Keywords":"Acute Disease\r\nAdult\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHaloperidol/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nPlacebos\r\nRitanserin/*therapeutic use\r\nSerotonin/physiology\r\nSerotonin Antagonists/*therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Akhondzadeh S, Mohajari H, Reza Mohammadi M, and Amini H (2003) Ritanserin as an adjunct to lithium and haloperidol for the treatment of medication-naive patients with acute mania: a double blind and placebo controlled trial..

One of the recommended treatment strategies in the international evidence-based guidelines is lifestyle modification, which includes diet and exercise, with the aim of improving a range of health outcomes. The incurable nature of PCOS reinforces the importance of developing novel and innovative symptomatic relief strategies, which are currently the only available approaches for improving quality of life for these women. Women with PCOS tend to be nutrient deficient in many common vitamins and minerals, thought to be associated with the psychological (depression, anxiety, etc.) and physiological (insulin resistance, diabetes, infertility, etc.) sequelae of the condition. Nutrient supplementation and the integration of complementary medicine as adjuncts to traditional lifestyle-based therapies in PCOS could therefore provide additional benefits to these women. In this review, we synthesize the evidence regarding nutrient supplementation and complementary therapies in PCOS, predominantly from randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, to provide an overview of the state of knowledge in this field. The evidence to date suggests that specific vitamins (B-12, inositols, folate, vitamins D, E, and K), vitamin-like nutrients (bioflavonoids and α-lipoic acid), minerals (calcium, zinc, selenium, and chromium picolinate), and other formulations (melatonin, ω-3 fatty acids, probiotics, and cinnamon), as well as some complementary approaches such as acupuncture and yoga may be beneficial in PCOS. However, there remain areas of uncertainty and key limitations in the literature that must be overcome before these therapies can be integrated into routine clinical practice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alesi S ; Ee C ; Moran LJ ; Rao V ; Mousa A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/advances/nmab141 ","Keywords":"*Complementary Therapies\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\n*Polycystic Ovary Syndrome/complications/drug therapy\r\nQuality of Life\r\nVitamins/therapeutic use\r\nPCOS\r\ncomplementary medicine\r\ndiet\r\nminerals\r\nnutraceutical\r\nnutrition\r\npolycystic ovary syndrome\r\nreview\r\nsupplementation\r\nvitamins","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alesi S, Ee C, Moran LJ, Rao V, and Mousa A (2022) Nutritional Supplements and Complementary Therapies in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome..

The lithium dosage usually given is around 900 mg/day and plasma level is maintained in the range of 0.5-0.8 mEq/L. However, the administration of lithium in this dosage necessitates monitoring of plasma concentration and increases the risk of toxicity and side effects. Since it has been shown that low lithium levels increase serotonin turnover and enhance serotonin neurotransmission, we thought it of interest to assess the efficacy of low dosage lithium augmentation for patients with resistant depression. Fifty one patients suffering from severe unipolar or bipolar depression who had failed to respond to treatment with venlafaxine 300-375 mg/day were included in the study and treated as outpatients. Patients had previously been exposed to unsuccessful treatment with various antidepressants, mostly SSRIs. After a washout period for previously administered antidepressants of one week, the dosage of venlafaxine was rapidly titrated to 300 or 375 mg/day, corresponding to about 5 mg/kg. The dose remained stable during the next six weeks. Additional antipsychotic medication was allowed to treat psychotic symptoms. Forty seven severely depressed patients who failed to respond to 300-375 mg/day venlafaxine were, in addition, given lithium carbonate in low dosage (300-450 mg/day). The Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale was used as the treatment outcome. A score of 1 or 2 was considered as non-response. All patients gave informed consent to participate in the study. Ratings were performed at baseline and after 1,2 and 5 weeks. Lithium plasma concentration measurements were performed after 1 and 4 weeks. After 5 weeks of augmentation, 51% of the patients were rated as \"much\" or \"very much\" improved. Bipolar patients showed a better response than unipolar (64.3% vs 45.5%, p<0.038). Most patients (76%) showed a rapid response (up tp 7 days), and only 2 patients (4.6%) responded after more than 2 weeks The mean lithium plasma level was 0.33±0.09 mEq/L. No significant differences were found in treatment response with regard to sex, family history, psychotic symptomatology and suicidal ideation. No troublesome side effects were reported. Our results show that treatment augmentation with low lithium dosage may be as effective as augmentation with higher dosage, is well tolerated and does not necessitate monitoring of plasma level. Hence, an initial trial of ugmentation at low dosage lithium may be the preferred first choice in non-emergent situations. The low dosage also minimizes the risk of side effects and drug-drug interactions. Prospective controlled studies to confirm our findings are needed as are larger scale comparisons with therapeutic dose lithium augmentation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alevizos B ; Alevizos E ; Leonardou A ; Zervas I ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/psychology\r\nCyclohexanols/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/psychology\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nVenlafaxine Hydrochloride\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alevizos B, Alevizos E, Leonardou A, and Zervas I (2012) Low dosage lithium augmentation in venlafaxine resistant depression: an open-label study..

These findings suggest that lithium may work as a stimulant of the renin-angiotensin system, and possibly as an antidepressant, by way of producing functional activation of the norepinephrine system independent of its action on the water and electrolyte balance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Altamura AC ; Morganti A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/BF00429057 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nDepression/blood/*drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNorepinephrine/metabolism\r\nPosture\r\nRenin/*blood\r\nSodium/metabolism\r\nWater-Electrolyte Balance/drug effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Altamura AC, and Morganti A (1975) Plasma renin activity in depressed patients treated with increasing doses of lithium carbonate..

METHOD: In a 16-week, double-blind, multisite comparison study, 142 participants with bipolar II depression were randomly assigned to receive lithium monotherapy (N=49), sertraline monotherapy (N=45), or combination treatment with lithium and sertraline (N=48). At each visit, mood was assessed using standardized rating scales. Rates of switch were compared, as were rates of treatment response and the presence and severity of treatment-emergent side effects. RESULTS: Twenty participants (14%) experienced a switch during the study period (hypomania, N=17; severe hypomania, N=3). Switch rates did not differ among the three treatment groups, even after accounting for dropout. No patient had a manic switch or was hospitalized for a switch. Most switches occurred within the first 5 weeks of treatment. The treatment response rate for the overall sample was 62.7% (N=89), without significant differences between groups after accounting for dropout. The lithium/sertraline combination group had a significantly higher overall dropout rate than the monotherapy groups but did not have an accelerated time to response. CONCLUSIONS: Lithium monotherapy, sertraline monotherapy, and lithium/sertraline combination therapy were associated with similar switch and treatment response rates in participants with bipolar II depression. The dropout rate was higher in the lithium/sertraline combination treatment group, without any treatment acceleration advantage.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Altshuler LL ; Sugar CA ; McElroy SL ; Calimlim B ; Gitlin M ; Keck PE Jr; Aquino-Elias A ; Martens BE ; Fischer EG ; English TL ; Roach J ; Suppes T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ajp.2016.15040558 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAffect/*drug effects\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPatient Dropouts\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nRisk\r\nSertraline/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nAntidepressants\r\nBipolar Depression\r\nBipolar II Disorder\r\nClinical Drug Studies\r\nDrug Side Effects-Other\r\nLithium","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Altshuler LL, Sugar CA, McElroy SL, Calimlim B, Gitlin M, Keck PE Jr, Aquino-Elias A, Martens BE, Fischer EG, English TL, Roach J, and Suppes T (2017) Switch Rates During Acute Treatment for Bipolar II Depression With Lithium, Sertraline, or the Two Combined: A Randomized Double-Blind Comparison..

METHODS: For this purpose, a randomized controlled trial with a clinical basis was fulfilled on a total of 68 patients with opioid use disorder receiving MMT, allocated to two groups, viz. intervention, and control (each one consisting of 34 individuals). Then, the participants in the intervention group were given zinc supplements combined with methadone for three months, and the controls only took methadone, according to the treatment plan. The data were collected using the Relapse Prediction Scale (RPS) and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21) before, one month after, and at the end of the intervention program. FINDINGS: Compared to the control group, the likelihood of drug use (p = 0.01), drug craving (p = 0.002), and the RPS total score (p = 0.002) in the intervention group was significantly lower. Moreover, the results revealed a significant decreasing trend in depression (p = 0.01), anxiety (p < 0.001), stress (p = 0.001), and the DASS-21 total score (p = 0.001) in the intervention. Compared to the control group, the DASS-21 total score (p < 0.001) in the intervention group was significantly lower. CONCLUSION: Accordingly, it was concluded that zinc supplementation could reduce the PoR and improve MH problems in patients with opioid use disorder experiencing MMT. However, further research is recommended to fill the gaps. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The research protocol has also been listed on the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) with code no.

However, it may also refer to the gradual loss of efficacy after repeated antidepressant exposures over time. The aim of this study was to examine the phenomenon of tachyphylaxis in patients with Bipolar II major depression treated with either venlafaxine or lithium. We hypothesized that a greater number of prior antidepressant exposures would result in a reduced response to venlafaxine, but not lithium, therapy. METHODS: 83 patients were randomized to treatment with either venlafaxine (n=43) or lithium (n=40). The primary outcome was a >or= 50% reduction in baseline Hamilton Depression Rating score. A detailed history of prior drug therapy was obtained. Logistic regression was used to test the hypothesis that prior antidepressant exposure was associated with reduced response to venlafaxine therapy. RESULTS: The mean number of prior antidepressant and mood stabilizer exposures was significantly higher in venlafaxine non-responders versus responders (p=0.02). There was no significant association between response to lithium and the number of prior antidepressant and mood stabilizer exposures (p=0.38). The odds of responding to venlafaxine or lithium therapy decreased with an increasing number of prior antidepressant exposures (p=0.04). Response was not significantly affected by the number of prior mood stabilizer exposures (p=0.30). Adjustment for clinical and demographic covariates sharpened the estimated impact of prior antidepressant exposure on treatment outcome. LIMITATIONS: This study was a post hoc exploratory analysis. The study was not specifically powered to test the hypothesis of an association between number of prior antidepressant drug exposures and response to venlafaxine or lithium therapy. CONCLUSION: These observations support earlier findings suggesting the presence of tachyphylaxis occurring after repeated antidepressant drug exposures. Possible mechanisms of tachyphylaxis may include genetic predisposition for non-response, physiological adaptation after repeated antidepressant exposures, and inherent illness and pharmacokinetic heterogeneity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Amsterdam JD ; Shults J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2008.07.007 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nAntimanic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nCyclohexanols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nLong-Term Care\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPersonality Inventory/statistics & numerical data\r\nPsychometrics\r\nRetreatment\r\n*Tachyphylaxis\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVenlafaxine Hydrochloride\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Amsterdam JD, and Shults J (2009) Does tachyphylaxis occur after repeated antidepressant exposure in patients with Bipolar II major depressive episode?.

We aimed to investigate the association between dietary intake of Mg and psychiatric disorders in a large cross-sectional study on Iranian adults. A total of 3172 Iranian adults (with an age range of 18-55 years) were included in this study. Data on dietary intakes were collected using a validated dish-based 106-item semi-quantitative FFQ. To assess depression and anxiety, an Iranian validated version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used. Furthermore, psychological distress was examined using the General Health Questionnaire. The mean age of men and women was 38·4 (sd 8·2) and 35·1 (sd 7·4) years, respectively. In unadjusted analyses, we found that higher dietary Mg intake was associated with lower odds of anxiety among women (OR 0·61; 95 % CI 0·41, 0·90), such that after taking potential confounders into account women in the highest quintile of Mg intake had a 39 % lower odds of anxiety compared with those in the lowest quintile (OR 0·61; 95 % CI 0·40, 0·93). Moreover, deficient Mg intake was positively associated with anxiety among all women (OR 1·80; 95 % CI 1·19, 2·72) and also normal-weight women (OR 1·73; 95 % CI 1·01, 2·95). In addition, a significant inverse association was found between dietary Mg intake and depression among normal-weight men (OR 0·45; 95 % CI 0·20, 0·99) and overweight women (OR 0·45; 95 % CI 0·24, 0·85).

After initial evaluation and diagnosis, the psychiatrist should first assess whether there is an urgent indication for ECT. If ECT is not indicated, and the patient has psychotic symptoms, then an antipsychotic should be part of the medication regimen. Next, if the patient is not currently treated with mood stabilizers, there is a slight preference for lithium. If lithium is not effective or tolerated, treatment with quetiapine or lamotrigine should be initiated. If the patient is currently taking other mood stabilizers, their dosage should be optimized, and the clinician should consider adding or switching to lithium, quetiapine, or lamotrigine. Next, if the patient is not at especially high risk of mood destabilization, an antidepressant can be added in the bipolar depressed patient who has failed trials of lithium, quetiapine, and lamotrigine. Rapid-cycling depressed patients may require combinations of two or three mood stabilizers. ECT, along with other psychopharmacological options, could be reconsidered for the treatment of refractory bipolar depressed patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ansari A ; Osser DN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3109/10673220903523524 ","Keywords":"Algorithms\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBenzodiazepines/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nClinical Protocols\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDibenzothiazepines/therapeutic use\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nFluoxetine/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLithium Carbonate/therapeutic use\r\nOlanzapine\r\nQuetiapine Fumarate\r\nTreatment Failure\r\nTriazines/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ansari A, and Osser DN (2010) The psychopharmacology algorithm project at the Harvard South Shore Program: an update on bipolar depression..

Although bipolar disorder constitutes a major public health problem, with a high risk of suicide and an economic cost exceeding that of unipolar depression, it has received comparatively little attention, particularly at the basic science level. Perhaps as a result of this neglect, there is currently no animal model able to simulate the cyclicity which is its defining characteristic. 2. Consequently, drug development in this area is meager and has proceeded serendipitously rather than empirically. 3. The authors have recently reported that repeated exposure to cocaine and other stressors can induce an oscillation or cycling in a host of neurochemical and physiological systems. 4. In order to test whether such cycling might be of potential relevance to bipolar disorder, the authors examined whether cocaine-induced cyclicity of amphetamine-evoked efflux of dopamine from slices of rat nucleus accumbens and striatum and/or cocaine induced oscillation of a behavior, stress-induced hypoalgesia, could be prevented by lithium, the agent of choice in treating this disease. 5. The authors report that prophylactic treatment with lithium, completely and specifically prevented oscillations in each instance. This may represent an important initial step toward the development of the first cycling model of bipolar disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Antelman SM ; Caggiula AR ; Kucinski BJ ; Fowler H ; Gershon S ; Edwards DJ ; Austin MC ; Stiller R ; Kiss S ; Kocan D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0278-5846(98)00020-7 ","Keywords":"Amphetamine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nAnimals\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*physiopathology\r\nCocaine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nCorpus Striatum/drug effects/physiology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDopamine/*metabolism\r\nDopamine Uptake Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nLithium/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nModels, Biological\r\nNucleus Accumbens/drug effects/physiology\r\nPain\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nStress, Psychological","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Antelman SM, Caggiula AR, Kucinski BJ, Fowler H, Gershon S, Edwards DJ, Austin MC, Stiller R, Kiss S, and Kocan D (1998) The effects of lithium on a potential cycling model of bipolar disorder..

While primarily geared toward the psychiatrist in general practice, the article provides useful information for the nonpsychiatric physician who is frequently called upon to evaluate and treat affective disorders in the geriatric population. Since tricyclic antidepressants and lithium are the most commonly used psychotropic drugs in the treatment of depression, their side effects and adverse reactions are discussed specifically as these relate to the elderly. Suggestions are offered on how to improve safety and enhance compliance. Brief mention is made of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors and the second generation antidepressants. Dose ranges are recommended for use of these agents in geriatric patients. Finally, a section of the article reviews the most commonly encountered encountered drug interactions between tricyclic and a variety of other psychotropic and nonpsychotropic drugs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Halaris A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2190/uhl6-0x4w-frng-8pff ","Keywords":"*Aged\r\nAmoxapine/adverse effects\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use\r\nAntihypertensive Agents/adverse effects\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/adverse effects\r\nBupropion\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy\r\nDoxepin/therapeutic use\r\nDrug Interactions\r\nHeart Diseases/chemically induced\r\nHumans\r\nHypotension, Orthostatic/chemically induced\r\nLithium/poisoning/therapeutic use\r\nMaprotiline/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\n*Patient Compliance\r\nPropiophenones/therapeutic use\r\nTrazodone/adverse effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Halaris A (    ) Antidepressant drug therapy in the elderly: enhancing safety and compliance..

Our purpose in this study is to investigate the association between Zn supplementation and postpartum depression, defined by an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score ≥ 9, and the effect on the hematological status of postpartum women. Materials and Methods: We first investigated whether zinc supplementation affected the perioperative levels of zinc, hemoglobin, and hematocrit in 197 cases who underwent cesarean section and had postpartum anemia. Next, logistic regression analyses were performed on 148 eligible cases to determine the association between zinc supplementation and postpartum depression. Results: Postpartum zinc supplementation significantly improved the status of maternal blood zinc levels and reduced the risk of developing postpartum depression (adjusted odds ratio: 0.249; 95% confidence interval: 0.062-0.988; p = 0.048). Iron supplementation is a standard and effective strategy for treating anemia; however, the combination of oral iron plus zinc supplementation resulted in slightly significant negative effects on postpartum hemoglobin and hematocrit compared to oral iron supplementation only. Conclusions: Postpartum zinc supplementation causes a significant positive effect on postpartum depression (EPDS score ≥ 9). Zinc supplementation had a negative but transient influence on the hematological status in women with postpartum anemia treated with oral iron supplementation; however, the differences were not clinically significant. Thus, we did not regard it as an adverse effect to be considered, and postpartum zinc supplementation may be viewed as beneficial in postpartum women.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aoki C ; Imai K ; Owaki T ; Kobayashi-Nakano T ; Ushida T ; Iitani Y ; Nakamura N ; Kajiyama H ; Kotani T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/medicina58060731 ","Keywords":"*Anemia/drug therapy/etiology\r\nCesarean Section\r\n*Depression, Postpartum/drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHemoglobins\r\nHumans\r\nIron/therapeutic use\r\nPregnancy\r\nZinc/therapeutic use\r\nEPDS\r\nFe\r\nZn\r\ncesarean section\r\nobstetrics","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aoki C, Imai K, Owaki T, Kobayashi-Nakano T, Ushida T, Iitani Y, Nakamura N, Kajiyama H, and Kotani T (2022) The Possible Effects of Zinc Supplementation on Postpartum Depression and Anemia..

The patients were evaluated at baseline and at the eighth week according to the body mass index, weight, Young Mania Rating (YMRS) and Hamilton Depression Rating (HAM-D) scales, and serum leptin levels. With respect to the leptin levels, a significant difference was observed after lithium treatment. There was a significant positive correlation between the changes in leptin levels and the duration of illness.

It may have a serious impact on an individual's lifestyle, as a result of decreased sociability and inability to spend time with family and friends due to intolerance of sound. SUBJECT: We present a case of hyperacusis associated with depression, with no other audiological abnormality. The patient reported greater difficulty during the depressive episode. METHOD: Audiological investigation was undertaken, followed by counselling and medication for depression. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The pathophysiological mechanism of hyperacusis in depression is discussed. Outcomes following treatment with directive counselling and lithium (an antidepressant) are described. Research indicates that both hyperacusis and depression can be caused by hypoactivity of 5-hydroxytryptamine (also known as serotonin) in the brain. The patient reported improvement which cannot be explained solely on the basis of counselling. Enhancement of serotonin activity due to lithium, prescribed for depression, may also play a role in alleviation of hyperacusis.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Attri D ; Nagarkar AN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S0022215109992258 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAudiometry\r\nDepression/complications/*drug therapy\r\nDirective Counseling\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nHyperacusis/psychology/*therapy\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use\r\nSelf Report\r\nSerotonin/physiology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Attri D, and Nagarkar AN (2010) Resolution of hyperacusis associated with depression, following lithium administration and directive counselling..

Management of TRD should consider patient-specific factors; drug therapy may be directed by depressive subtype or the presence of psychiatric comorbidity. Increasing the dose or duration of current antidepressant therapy is appropriate for patients who have received inadequate therapy in the past. Augmentation of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy with thyroid hormone (T3) or lithium has been shown to be effective in open and controlled trials. Efficacy of other strategies such as higher-dose antidepressant treatment, venlafaxine therapy, combined antidepressant therapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), or augmentation with pindolol or buspirone has been less well established, but emerging data from open studies and case reports are encouraging.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nemeroff CB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/(SICI)1520-6394(1996)4:4<169::AID-DA3>3.0.CO;2-A ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDiagnosis, Differential\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nemeroff CB (    ) Augmentation strategies in patients with refractory depression..

However, it accounts for 10% to 25% of all geriatric patients with mood disorders and 5% of patients admitted to geropsychiatric inpatient units. These patients often present a tremendous treatment challenge to clinicians. They frequently have differing treatment needs compared with their younger counterparts because of substantial medical comorbidity and age-related variations in response to therapy. Unfortunately, the management of geriatric bipolar disorder has been relatively neglected compared with the younger population. There continues to be a scarcity of published, controlled trials in the elderly, and no treatment algorithms specific to bipolar disorder in the elderly have been devised. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this article was to review the current literature on both the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic management of late-life bipolar disorder. METHODS: English-language articles written on the treatment of bipolar disorder in the elderly were identified. The first step in data collection involved a search for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (up until the third quarter of 2006). Systematic reviews were then located in the following databases: MEDLINE (1966-September 2006), EMBASE (1980-2006 [week 36]), and PsycINFO (1967-September 2006 [week 1]). Additional use was made of these 3 databases in searching for single randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, cohort studies, case-control studies, case series, and case reports. \"Elderly,\" used synonymously with \"geriatric,\" was defined as individuals aged > or =60 years. However, to take into account ambiguity in the nomenclature, the key words aged, geriatric, elderly, and older were combined with words indicating pharmacologic treatments such as pharmacotherapy; classes of medications (eg, lithium, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines); and names of selected individual medications (eg, lithium, valproic acid, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, gabapentin, zonisamide, clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole). These terms were then combined with the diagnostic terms bipolar disorder, mania, hypomania, depression, or bipolar depression. Finally, the terms ECT and psychotherapy were also queried in combination with indicators for age and diagnosis. A few articles on \"older adults,\" usually defined as individuals aged 50 to 55 years, were also included. They may allow for possible extrapolation of data to the geriatric population. Additionally, several mixed-age studies were included for similar considerations. Case reports and case series were described for their potential heuristic value. RESULTS: Unfortunately, there is a considerable dearth of literature involving evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and even randomized controlled trials in elderly individuals with bipolar disorder. Available options for the treatment of bipolar disorder (including those for mania, hypomania, depression, or maintenance) in the elderly include lithium, antiepileptics, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The data for the treatment of late-life bipolar disorder are limited, but the available evidence shows efficacy for some commonly used treatments. Lithium, divalproex sodium, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants have all been found to be beneficial in the treatment of elderly patients with bipolar disorder. Although there are no specific guidelines for the treatment of these patients, monotherapy followed by combination therapy of the various classes of drugs may help with the resolution of symptoms. ECT and psychotherapy may be useful in the treatment of refractory disease. There is a need for more controlled studies in this age group before definitive treatment strategies can be enumerated.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aziz R ; Lorberg B ; Tampi RR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.amjopharm.2006.12.007 ","Keywords":"Age of Onset\r\nAged\r\nAnticonvulsants/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBenzodiazepines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/epidemiology/therapy\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychotherapy\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aziz R, Lorberg B, and Tampi RR (2006) Treatments for late-life bipolar disorder..

Consequently, treatment strategies need to take mood disorders into account. In depressed and actively psychotic schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients, treatment with neuroleptic plus antidepressant may be less effective than neuroleptic alone. However, patients with post-psychotic depression on maintenance neuroleptics respond well to tricyclic antidepressants. Mood disorders can be caused by neuroleptics and if so will often improve if the dose is reduced or if the drug is changed. Anticholinergics may also help. In schizoaffective disorder, lithium is usually beneficial, especially for patients with classical affective disorder. Carbamazepine may be more effective in patients with schizoaffective and schizophreniform disorders. At doses comparable with those effective in schizophrenia, clozapine may be as good or better than conventional neuroleptics in schizophrenic patients with psychotic mood disorder or schizoaffective disorder. In patients with high BPRS anxiety/depression scores, risperidone (8 mg/day) was more effective than haloperidol (10 mg/day). Risperidone at a mean dose of 8.6 mg/day was also more effective than haloperidol (mean dose 9.2 mg/day) or levomepromazine (methotrimeprazine -- mean dose 125 mg/day) on the Psychotic Anxiety Scale. Mood-related symptoms are therefore amenable to treatment.

METHODS: In this long-term naturalistic study, clinical data from 55 patients with MDD (DSM-III-R) were collected prospectively in an outpatient clinic specializing in the treatment of affective disorders. OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in hospital admission rate (number and duration) during prophylaxis compared with the period before prophylaxis, Morbidity-Index during prophylaxis and time to first recurrence after initiation of lithium treatment. RESULTS: During an average follow-up period of 6.7 years, a significant decline in the number of days spent in hospital (p<0.001; 52 d/yr less; 95; CI 31-73 d) and a low Morbidity-Index (mean 0.07) was observed. Only in 6 patients did medication have to be changed because of side-effects (n=4) or a lack of efficacy (n=2). None of the independent variables we analyzed proved to be important in predicting the outcome of lithium prophylaxis. Comedication was necessary in 21 patients. The overall outcome of their prophylactic treatment, however, did not differ from the group that did not receive comedication in the symptom-free intervals. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study, with its long observation period and the inclusion of comedication as a confounding variable, indicate that lithium is a potent prophylactic agent for unipolar MDD in a naturalistic setting. In contrast to the findings of others, age was not associated with the outcome of prophylaxis, and latency did not predict outcome. Contrary to doubts that have been raised in recent years with regard to the effectiveness of lithium in everyday clinical practice, lithium appears to be a safe and potent alternative to antidepressants.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baethge C ; Gruschka P ; Smolka MN ; Berghöfer A ; Bschor T ; Müller-Oerlinghausen B ; Bauer M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nLong-Term Care\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPatient Readmission/statistics & numerical data\r\nProspective Studies\r\nSecondary Prevention\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baethge C, Gruschka P, Smolka MN, Berghöfer A, Bschor T, Müller-Oerlinghausen B, and Bauer M (2003) Effectiveness and outcome predictors of long-term lithium prophylaxis in unipolar major depressive disorder..

Diagnostic classification of depression including the concepts of melancholic, endogenous, or severe depression describe severely depressed patients suffering from most of the core symptoms, together with clinical characteristics of a cyclic unipolar or bipolar course, lower placebo response rates, higher response rates to electroconvulsive therapy, to antidepressant treatments with dually or mixed modes of action, or to lithium augmentation. Higher rates of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity and specific electroencephalographic patterns have also been shown in this patient group. Summarizing the symptomatology of depression in these patients, a broad overlap between the abovementioned subgroups can be suggested. Because the positive diagnosis of those core symptoms of depression may include clinical consequences, it would be of use to integrate all the mentioned concepts in the upcoming new versions of the diagnostic systems DSM-V and ICD-11.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baghai TC ; Eser D ; Möller HJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.31887/DCNS.2008.10.3/tcbaghai ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*classification/physiopathology/*therapy\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baghai TC, Eser D, and Möller HJ (2008) Effects of different antidepressant treatments on the core of depression..

METHODS/PROCEDURES: The search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and clinicaltrials.gov from the inception to December 31, 2018, provided 32 studies in mania, 16 in bipolar depression, and 13 in maintenance. Data of DAEs, WG, and somnolence from each study were extracted. The risk for these variables of an active treatment relative to placebo was estimated with a number needed to harm (NNH) as a single study and pooled sample. FINDINGS/RESULTS: For DAEs, pooled NNH ranged from 19 with carbamazepine to -21 with quetiapine-XR in mania, 11 with quetiapine-IR 600 mg/d to -37 with olanzapine/fluoxetine combination in bipolar depression, and 5 with lithium to -8 with asenapine in maintenance. For WG, pooled NNH ranged from 9 with olanzapine to -78 with aripiprazole in mania, 5 with olanzapine to -112 with lithium in bipolar depression, and 4 with olanzapine to 126 with asenapine in maintenance. For somnolence, pooled NNH was from 5 with carbamazepine to 23 with cariprazine in mania, 3 with quetiapine-XR 300 mg/d to 79 with lurasidone in bipolar depression, and 11 with olanzapine to -49 with aripiprazole in maintenance.

This analysis focused on a dysphoric subgroup with baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) total scores of 20 or over contrasted with non-dysphoric patients. RESULTS: In the dysphoric subgroup (n=85) mean HRSD total score improvement was significantly greater in olanzapine co-therapy patients than in those receiving placebo plus lithium or valproate (P<0.001). Substantial contributors to this superiority included the HRSD Maier sub-scale (P=0.013) and the suicide item (P=0.001). Total Young Mania Rating Scale improvement was also superior with olanzapine co-therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute dysphoric mania, addition of olanzapine to ongoing lithium or valproate monotherapy significantly improved depressive symptom, mania and suicidality ratings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baker RW ; Brown E ; Akiskal HS ; Calabrese JR ; Ketter TA ; Schuh LM ; Trzepacz PT ; Watkin JG ; Tohen M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1192/bjp.185.6.472 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents\r\nBenzodiazepines/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nOlanzapine\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nValproic Acid/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baker RW, Brown E, Akiskal HS, Calabrese JR, Ketter TA, Schuh LM, Trzepacz PT, Watkin JG, and Tohen M (2004) Efficacy of olanzapine combined with valproate or lithium in the treatment of dysphoric mania..

Bipolar patients spend more time depressed than manic; however, few agents used for maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder have demonstrated good efficacy in delaying relapse into depression. This article provides a comprehensive review of open-label and randomized, controlled studies examining prophylactic efficacy in bipolar disorder, especially bipolar depression. Lithium, considered the gold standard for bipolar disorder maintenance therapy may be more effective in delaying manic relapse than in delaying depressive relapse. Evidence for the efficacy of divalproex and carbamazepine in delaying depressive relapse is yet to be fully elucidated. Lamotrigine has demonstrated efficacy in delaying time to depressive relapse. Unpublished studies show olanzapine's efficacy in preventing manic recurrence, while its efficacy in preventing depressive recurrence is yet to be proven. As patients with bipolar disorder are prone to experiencing depressive episodes, more attention needs to be focused on preventing depressive relapse. To date, three agents--lithium, lamotrigine, and olanzapine--have been shown to have prophylactic benefits in treating this highly recurrent disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baldassano CF ; Ballas CA ; O'Reardon JP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/s1092852900004351 ","Keywords":"Amines/therapeutic use\r\nAnticonvulsants/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nCarbamazepine/therapeutic use\r\nChronic Disease\r\nCyclohexanecarboxylic Acids/therapeutic use\r\nFructose/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use\r\nGabapentin\r\nHumans\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLithium Carbonate/therapeutic use\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTime\r\nTopiramate\r\nTriazines/therapeutic use\r\nValproic Acid/therapeutic use\r\ngamma-Aminobutyric Acid/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baldassano CF, Ballas CA, and O'Reardon JP (2004) Rethinking the treatment paradigm for bipolar depression: the importance of long-term management..

We review and summarize findings that help to quantify relationships between the presence versus the absence of lithium maintenance and suicides or attempts in patients with bipolar or other major affective disorders. Results from 33 studies (1970-2000) yielded 13-fold lower rates of suicide and reported attempts during long-term lithium treatment than without it or after it was discontinued. Although greatly reduced, these rates remain above those estimated for the general population. Evidence for substantial, if incomplete, protection against suicide with lithium is supported by more compelling evidence than that for any other treatment provided for patients with mood disorders.

The place of lithium in contemporary psychiatric therapeutics has become controversial, calling for the present overview of research findings pertaining to its use in treating patients with bipolar disorder. Lithium, by itself, typically is inadequate for rapid control of acute mania; antipsychotics, divalproex, or potent sedatives are commonly used, with or without lithium, for this purpose. The special usefulness of lithium lies in long-term prevention of recurrences of mania and bipolar depression and in reducing risk of suicidal behavior. Lithium also may be beneficial in recurrent unipolar depression and is an effective adjunct for treatment-resistant depression. Expectations that prolonged untreated bipolar illness, multiple episodes, rapid cycling, or retreatment following discontinuation might routinely lead to lithium nonresponsiveness, and the belief that lithium is too toxic for use during pregnancy, have not been borne out by research. Lithium retains a substantial share of prescriptions for bipolar disorder and is inexpensive. No other treatment has performed as well as lithium in as many aspects of long-term care of bipolar disorder patients, and despite some risks and limitations, lithium remains the standard against which all proposed alternatives are compared.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baldessarini RJ ; Tondo L ; Hennen J ; Viguera AC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/psychology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nPregnancy\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baldessarini RJ, Tondo L, Hennen J, and Viguera AC (2002) Is lithium still worth using?

An exception is growing evidence for such suicidal risk reduction with long-term lithium maintenance. This report updates and extends analyses of lithium treatment and suicides and attempts. METHOD: We pooled data from studies providing data on suicidal acts, patients at risk, and average exposure times with or without lithium maintenance therapy, and considered effects of lithium on selected subgroups. RESULTS: Data from 34 reported studies involved 42 groups with lithium maintenance averaging 3.36 years, and 25 groups without lithium followed for 5.88 years, representing 16,221 patients in a total experience of 64,233 person-years. Risks for all suicidal acts/100 person-years averaged 3.10 without lithium versus 0.210 during treatment (93% difference) versus approximately 0.315 for the general population. For attempts, corresponding rates were 4.65 versus 0.312 (93% difference), and for completed suicides, 0.942 versus 0.174 (82% difference). Subjects with bipolar versus various recurrent major affective disorders showed similar benefits (95% vs. 91% sparing of all suicidal acts). Risk reductions for unipolar depressive, bipolar II, and bipolar I cases ranked 100%, 82%, and 67%. Suicide risk without lithium tended to increase from 1970 to 2002, with no loss of effectiveness of lithium treatment. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate major reductions of suicidal risks (attempts > suicides) with lithium maintenance therapy in unipolar >/= bipolar II >/= bipolar I disorder, to overall levels close to general population rates. These major benefits in syndromes mainly involving depression encourage evaluation of other treatments aimed at reducing mortality in the depressive and mixed phases of bipolar disorder and in unipolar major depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baldessarini RJ ; Tondo L ; Hennen J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/prevention & control/psychology\r\nDepressive Disorder/prevention & control/psychology\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMood Disorders/drug therapy/*prevention & control/psychology\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSuicide/statistics & numerical data\r\nSuicide, Attempted/*prevention & control/statistics & numerical data\r\n*Suicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baldessarini RJ, Tondo L, and Hennen J (2003) Lithium treatment and suicide risk in major affective disorders: update and new findings..

METHODS: Broad searching yielded 45 studies providing rates of suicidal acts during lithium treatment, including 34 also providing rates without lithium treatment. We scored study quality, tested between-study variance, and examined suicidal rates on versus off lithium by meta-analytic methods to determine risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: In 31 studies suitable for meta-analysis, involving a total of 85,229 person-years of risk-exposure, the overall risk of suicides and attempts was five times less among lithium-treated subjects than among those not treated with lithium (RR = 4.91, 95% CI 3.82-6.31, p < 0.0001). Similar effects were found with other meta-analytic methods, as well as for completed versus attempted suicide, and for bipolar versus major mood disorder patients. Studies with higher quality ratings, including randomized, controlled trials, involved shorter exposures with somewhat lesser lithium superiority. Omitting one very large study or those involving lithium-discontinuation had little effect on the results. The incidence-ratio of attempts-to-suicides increased 2.5 times with lithium-treatment, indicating reduced lethality of suicidal acts. There was no indication of bias toward reporting positive findings, nor were outcomes significantly influenced by publication-year or study size. CONCLUSIONS: Risks of completed and attempted suicide were consistently lower, by approximately 80%, during treatment of bipolar and other major affective disorder patients with lithium for an average of 18 months. These benefits were sustained in randomized as well as open clinical trials.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baldessarini RJ ; Tondo L ; Davis P ; Pompili M ; Goodwin FK ; Hennen J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1399-5618.2006.00344.x ","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*epidemiology\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use\r\nPrevalence\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSuicide/psychology/statistics & numerical data\r\nSuicide, Attempted/psychology/*statistics & numerical data\r\nTime Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baldessarini RJ, Tondo L, Davis P, Pompili M, Goodwin FK, and Hennen J (2006) Decreased risk of suicides and attempts during long-term lithium treatment: a meta-analytic review..

Effective treatment of acute or dysphoric mania is provided by modern antipsychotics, some anticonvulsants (divalproex and carbamazepine), and lithium salts. Treatment of BD-depression remains unsatisfactory but includes some modern antipsychotics (particularly lurasidone, olanzapine + fluoxetine, and quetiapine) and the anticonvulsant lamotrigine; value and safety of antidepressants remain controversial. Long-term prophylactic treatment relies on lithium, off-label use of valproate, and growing use of modern antipsychotics. Lithium has unique evidence of antisuicide effects. Methods of evaluating treatments for BD rely heavily on meta-analysis, which is convenient but with important limitations. Underdeveloped treatment for BD-depression may reflect an assumption that effects of antidepressants are similar in BD as in unipolar major depressive disorder. Effective prophylaxis of BD is limited by the efficacy of available treatments and incomplete adherence owing to adverse effects, costs, and lack of ongoing symptoms. Long-term treatment of BD also is limited by access to, and support of expert, comprehensive clinical programs. Pursuit of improved, rationally designed pharmacological treatments for BD, as for most psychiatric disorders, is fundamentally limited by lack of coherent pathophysiology or etiology.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baldessarini RJ ; Tondo L ; Vázquez GH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41380-018-0044-2 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baldessarini RJ, Tondo L, and Vázquez GH (2019) Pharmacological treatment of adult bipolar disorder..

As the predominant psychopathology even in treated BD, depression is associated not only with excess morbidity, but also mortality from co-occurring general-medical disorders and high suicide risk. In BD, risks for medical disorders including diabetes or metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disorders, and associated mortality rates are several-times above those for the general population or with other psychiatric disorders. The SMR for suicide with BD reaches 20-times above general-population rates, and exceeds rates with other major psychiatric disorders. In BD, suicide is strongly associated with mixed (agitated-dysphoric) and depressive phases, time depressed, and hospitalization. Lithium may reduce suicide risk in BD; clozapine and ketamine require further testing. Treatment of bipolar depression is far less well investigated than unipolar depression, particularly for long-term prophylaxis. Short-term efficacy of antidepressants for bipolar depression remains controversial and they risk clinical worsening, especially in mixed states and with rapid-cycling. Evidence of efficacy of lithium and anticonvulsants for bipolar depression is very limited; lamotrigine has long-term benefit, but valproate and carbamazepine are inadequately tested and carry high teratogenic risks. Evidence is emerging of short-term efficacy of several modern antipsychotics (including cariprazine, lurasidone, olanzapine-fluoxetine, and quetiapine) for bipolar depression, including with mixed features, though they risk adverse metabolic and neurological effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baldessarini RJ ; Vázquez GH ; Tondo L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s40345-019-0160-1 ","Keywords":"Bipolar disorder\r\nDepression\r\nDisability\r\nMorbidity\r\nMortality\r\nSuicide\r\nTreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baldessarini RJ, Vázquez GH, and Tondo L (2020) Bipolar depression: a major unsolved challenge..

Since recent studies have suggested Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as a potential risk factor or condition that precedes and correlates with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), this study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of OSX in an AD mouse model induced by intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ). To address this protective effect, mice were pre-treated with intragastrical OSX (0.1 mg/kg) or vehicle for 20 days. After the pre-treatment, mice were submitted to two alternated intracerebroventricular infusions of STZ (days 21 and 23) or saline. 15 days after the last STZ injection, cognitive and memory skills of the treated mice were evaluated on object recognition test, Y-maze, stepdown passive avoidance and social recognition paradigms. Added to that, measurements of oxidative stress markers and gene expression were evaluated in brain samples of the same mice groups. Mice pre-treatment with OSX protected mice from cognitive and memory decline elicited by STZ. This effect was attributed to the prevention of lipid peroxidation and modulation of acetylcholinesterase and monoamine oxidase activities in cerebral cortices and hippocampi by OSX treatment. Furthermore, OSX treatment demonstrated reduction of amyloidogenic pathway genes expression when compared to the control groups. Besides that, OSX treatment showed no hepatic and renal toxicity in the protocol used for treatment. Considering the antidepressant-like effect of OSX, together with the ability to prevent memory and cognitive impairment, this new compound may be an interesting strategy for targeting the comorbidity between MDD and AD, in a multitarget drug paradigm.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baldinotti R ; Fronza MG ; Fetter J ; Silva L ; Bender CB ; Lüdtke DS ; Seixas FK ; Collares T ; Alves D ; Savegnago L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.174499 ","Keywords":"Alzheimer Disease/chemically induced/pathology/*prevention & control\r\nAnimals\r\nCerebral Cortex/drug effects/pathology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nGlycosides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/pathology\r\nHumans\r\nInfusions, Intraventricular\r\nLipid Peroxidation/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nOrganoselenium Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nOxidative Stress/drug effects\r\nStreptozocin/administration & dosage/toxicity\r\nAcetylcholinesterase inhibitor\r\nAmyloidogenic pathway\r\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitor\r\nSelenocarbohydrates\r\nanti-Alzheimer","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baldinotti R, Fronza MG, Fetter J, Silva L, Bender CB, Lüdtke DS, Seixas FK, Collares T, Alves D, and Savegnago L (2021) Protective effects of octylseleno-xylofuranoside in a streptozotocin-induced mouse model of Alzheimer's disease..

In mild to moderate depression, there is no reliable evidence that any one treatment is superior in improving symptoms of depression, but the strength of evidence supporting different treatments varies. In severe depression, only prescription antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy are known to improve symptoms. METHODS AND OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in mild to moderate and severe depression, and in treatment-resistant depression? Which interventions reduce relapse rates? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to April 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 87 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antidepressant drugs (tricyclic antidepressants [including low-dose tricyclic antidepressants], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, reboxetine, or venlafaxine), continuing prescription antidepressant drugs, electroconvulsive therapy, exercise, lithium augmentation, pindolol augmentation, St John's Wort.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Barbui C ; Butler R ; Cipriani A ; Geddes J ; Hatcher S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAdult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use\r\n*Depression\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Barbui C, Butler R, Cipriani A, Geddes J, and Hatcher S (2007) Depression in adults: drug and physical treatments..

Patients were randomly assigned to cognitive behaviour therapy in addition. All but 1 of the patients who ultimately entered the trial were unipolar depressives; 2 bipolar patients were withdrawn in the initial drug-free period because of the development of mixed affective states. Eleven of 20 patients showed an improvement to less than 50% of their initial scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and all those who improved did so in the first 6 weeks. Cognitive behaviour therapy did not seem to influence the response, but it is recognized that the short duration of therapy may be inadequate in these circumstances. It is suggested that intensive drug treatment is a necessary preliminary in management and may allow the effective use of rehabilitation aimed at the secondary handicaps of chronic depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Barker WA ; Scott J ; Eccleston D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00004850-198707000-00008 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*Behavior Therapy\r\nCardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced\r\nChronic Disease\r\nCognition\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/*therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nLithium Carbonate\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPhenelzine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nTryptophan/*therapeutic use\r\nVanadium/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Barker WA, Scott J, and Eccleston D (1987) The Newcastle chronic depression study: results of a treatment regime..

A thorough MEDLINE search was utilized to collect many papers dedicated to this area of study spanning 1989-2005. MEASUREMENTS: Papers were divided based upon drug intervention and scientific merit, where randomized controlled trials were given the most evidence-based weight and case studies the least. RESULTS: The literature review data is divided into augmentation and combination strategies in descending order of scientific stringency. For augmentation, lithium, antipsychotic, and thyroid addition has the most empirical support. For combination strategies, heterocyclic addition is the best studied. CONCLUSION: There is much literature regarding complex medication management of major depression that is generally supportive of this practice. However, much of the literature contains underpowered and uncontrolled studies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Barowsky J ; Schwartz TL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"antidepressant\r\naugmentation\r\ncombination\r\nmajor depression\r\npolypharmacy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Barowsky J, and Schwartz TL (2006) An Evidence-Based Approach to Augmentation and Combination Strategies for: Treatment-Resistant Depression..

Widowhood or divorce in the last six months, alcoholism, degenerative illnesses of the nervous central system, recent diagnosis of diabetes, previous or current treatment with antidepressants, chronic diarrhea, use of diuretics, and reduced renal function were exclusion criteria. Hypomagnesemia was defined by serum magnesium levels < 1.8 mg/dL and depression by Yasavage and Brink score > or = 11 points. The primary trial end point was the improvement of depression symptoms. At baseline, there were no differences by age (69 +/- 5.9 and 66.4 +/- 6.1 years, p = 0.39), duration of diabetes (11.8 +/- 7.9 and 8.6 +/- 5.7 years, p = 0.33), serum magnesium levels (1.3 +/- 0.04 and 1.4 +/- 0.04 mg/dL, p = 0.09), and Yasavage and Brink Score (17.9 +/- 3.9 and 16.1 +/- 4.5 point, p = 0.34) in the groups with MgCl2 and imipramine, respectively.

The initial dosages could be increased after 2 weeks to 40 mg/day and 150 mg/day, respectively, and the patients were treated for a total of 6 weeks. Efficacy was assessed weekly with the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), and safety was assessed with the Dosage Record and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale. After 4 weeks, a significantly greater proportion of patients in the paroxetine group had achieved a 50% reduction in baseline HAM-D scores, and the mean improvement in CGI severity of illness was significantly greater in the paroxetine group at weeks 3 and 5. The type and number of emergent events occurring during study treatment corresponded to the known side effect profiles of paroxetine and amitriptyline. Serum lithium levels were not affected by either antidepressant.

The authors undertook this meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy of lithium augmentation of conventional antidepressants. An attempt was made to identify all placebo-controlled trials of lithium augmentation in refractory depression. Only double-blind studies that involved participants who had been treated with lithium or placebo addition after not responding to conventional antidepressants were to be included in the meta-analysis. Further inclusion criteria were the use of accepted diagnostic criteria for depression and the use of response criteria based on the acceptable measurement of depression as an outcome variable. Studies were located by a search of the MEDLINE database, a search in the Cochrane Library, and an intensive search by hand of reviews on lithium augmentation. Nine of 11 placebo-controlled, double-blind studies were included in this meta-analysis. Aggregating three studies with a total of 110 patients that used a minimum lithium dose of 800 mg/day, or a dose sufficient to reach lithium serum levels of > or = 0.5 mEq/L, and a minimum treatment duration of 2 weeks, the authors found that the pooled odds ratio of response during lithium augmentation compared with the response during placebo treatment was 3.31 (95% confidence interval, 1.46-7.53). The corresponding relative response rate was 2.14 (95% confidence interval, 1.23-3.70), the absolute improvement in response rate was 27% (95% confidence interval, 9.8%-44.2%), and the number of patients needed to be treated to obtain one more responder was 3.7. Inclusion of six more studies that fulfilled inclusion criteria but which treated subjects with additional lithium for less than 2 weeks or with a lower lithium dose (total, 234 patients) resulted in even higher estimates. Lithium augmentation seems to be the treatment strategy in refractory depression that has been investigated most frequently in placebo-controlled, double-blind studies. The authors conclude from this meta-analysis that with respect to efficacy, lithium augmentation is the first-choice treatment procedure for depressed patients who fail to respond to antidepressant monotherapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bauer M ; Dopfmer S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00004714-199910000-00006 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMEDLINE\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nResearch Design\r\nUnited States","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bauer M, and Dopfmer S (1999) Lithium augmentation in treatment-resistant depression: meta-analysis of placebo-controlled studies..

The authors examined the efficacy of lithium augmentation in the continuation treatment of unipolar major depressive disorder. METHOD: Thirty patients with a refractory major depressive episode who had responded to acute lithium augmentation during an open 6-week study participated in a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of lithium augmentation during continuation treatment. After a 2-4-week stabilization period following remission, patients were randomly assigned to receive either lithium or placebo for a 4-month period. Antidepressant medication was continued throughout the study. RESULTS: Relapses (including one suicide) occurred in seven (47%) of the 15 patients who received placebo in addition to antidepressants. None (0%) of the 14 patients who received lithium augmentation with antidepressants suffered a relapse during the double-blind phase of the study. Five of the seven relapsing patients in the placebo group developed a depressive episode, and the other two experienced a manic episode.

The authors undertook this meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy of lithium augmentation of conventional antidepressants. An attempt was made to identify all placebo-controlled trials of lithium augmentation in refractory depression. Only double-blind studies that involved participants who had been treated with lithium or placebo addition after not responding to conventional antidepressants were to be included in the meta-analysis. Further inclusion criteria were the use of accepted diagnostic criteria for depression and the use of response criteria based on the acceptable measurement of depression as an outcome variable. Studies were located by a search of the MEDLINE database, a search in the Cochrane Library, and an intensive search by hand of reviews on lithium augmentation. Nine of 11 placebo-controlled, double-blind studies were included in this meta-analysis. Aggregating three studies with a total of 110 patients that used a minimum lithium dose of 800 mg/day, or a dose sufficient to reach lithium serum levels of >=0.5 mEq/L, and a minimum treatment duration of 2 weeks, the authors found that the pooled odds ratio of response during lithium augmentation compared with the response during placebo treatment was 3.31 (95% confidence interval, 1.46-7.53). The corresponding relative response rate was 2.14 (95% confidence interval, 1.23-3.70), the absolute improvement in response rate was 27% (95% confidence interval, 9.8%-44.2%), and the number of patients needed to be treated to obtain one more responder was 3.7. Inclusion of six more studies that fulfilled inclusion criteria but which treated subjects with additional lithium for less than 2 weeks or with a lower lithium dose (total, 234 patients) resulted in even higher estimates. Lithium augmentation seems to be the treatment strategy in refractory depression that has been investigated most frequently in placebo-controlled, double-blind studies. The authors conclude from this meta-analysis that with respect to efficacy, lithium augmentation is the first-choice treatment procedure for depressed patients who fail to respond to antidepressant monotherapy.\n\n\nDEPRESSED PATIENTS WHO do not respond to adequately performed standard treatment remain one of the challenging issues in psychiatry. Despite the availability of the newer and more selective antidepressants, e.g., the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), 20% to 30% of depressed patients fail to improve satisfactorily, and approximately 15% may develop chronic depression.1-3 Various treatment strategies have been proposed for the patient with refractory depression; however, most of these were derived from theoretical viewpoints and fewer from data gained by controlled studies. This is especially true for switching to an antidepressant drug with a different neurochemical mechanism of action and for combining multiple antidepressants, two major alternatives often applied as second-line treatment.2, 4, 5 In contrast, adjunct drugs given in addition to an antidepressant, so-called \"augmentation strategies,\" have repeatedly been investigated in controlled trials.6, 7 Other than its broad administration in the prophylaxis of affective disorders,8, 9 the use of additional lithium in refractory depression has increased rapidly 10 since its optimistic first description in an open study.11 Lithium has been found to potentiate the therapeutic effects of a broad spectrum of anti-depressant treatments, including SSRIs.10, 12 Some clinicians recommend lithium augmentation as the first-line strategy in patients who do not respond first to an adequate trial of antidepressant monotherapy.13 However, to date, there has been no consensus on the efficacy of lithium as an add-on drug to augment the effects of antidepressants. The reasons for this are that some of the placebo-controlled, double-blind studies had severe methodologic problems and that some of the early studies were negative.14 In 1991, Austin and associates 15 found a highly significant effect for lithium augmentation in their quantitative analysis of 99 patients from 5 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. However, the utility of their meta-analysis was criticized because of the methodologic problems of the studies being analyzed.16 In the meantime, several placebo-controlled studies with improved methodologies including larger numbers of patients were conducted to investigate the efficacy of lithium addition to conventional antidepressants.17-20 The objective of this meta-analysis is to determine whether evidence exists to support the clinical efficacy of lithium augmentation in refractory depression.\n回到顶端\nMethods\n回到顶端\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nOnly placebo-controlled, double-blind studies that involved participants who had been treated with lithium or placebo addition after not responding to conventional antidepressants were to be included in the meta-analysis. Further inclusion criteria were the use of accepted operationalized diagnostic criteria for depression (DSM-III, ICD-9, or research diagnostic criteria [RDC]) and the use of response criteria based on the acceptable measurement of depression as an outcome variable. In trials that used multiple treatment arms, only the data from the lithium and placebo arms were included. Preliminary reports of placebo-controlled trials were excluded if the final version was published in the meantime.\n回到顶端\nLiterature search\nAn attempt was made to identify all placebo-controlled clinical trials of lithium augmentation in depressed patients refractory to treatment with antidepressants alone. Studies were located in the following manner:\n* A computerized literature search of MEDLINE (on WinSpirs) from 1980 through June 1997 using the keywords \"lithium augmentation,\" \"lithium addition,\" \"lithium with augmentation,\" and \"lithium with depression.\"\n* A computerized search in the Cochrane Library using the keywords \"lithium augmentation\" and \"lithium addition.\"\n* An intensive search by hand using the references of published reviews on lithium augmentation 14, 21-26 and standard textbooks on refractory depression.27-29a No language constraints were applied.\n回到顶端\nAssessment of Comparability\nThe quality of every study was assessed independently by the two investigators (M.B., S.D.) according to the Quality Assessment Scale set forth by Detsky and associates.30 Results were compared, and differences were discussed and settled by consensus. Because not every question on this scale is applicable to every study, quality was expressed as a percentage of achievable scores. Furthermore, the comparability of the studies with respect to the study population, antidepressant treatment, lithium dose, duration of study therapy, and definition of response was evaluated.\n回到顶端\nStatistical analysis\nThe response rates of the single studies were taken as reported, without adaptation to a standardized response criterion. The investigators of the original studies were consulted when details of interest were not available from the published data. As the main measure of the effect size, the odds ratio together with its 95% confidence interval was calculated for every study. To combine the single odds ratios, the Mantel-Haenszel method of pooling was used.31 The variance of the pooled estimate was calculated according to the method used by Robins and associates.32 A formal test of the hypothesis that there is no study-by-effect interaction was applied,33 and because no statistically significant heterogeneity could be found, the variance of the studies' effect sizes was not taken into account when calculating the confidence intervals. Nevertheless it was appreciated that there was clinically relevant heterogeneity, and this was dealt with by performing cumulative meta-analyses with respect to lithium dosage (in increasing order) and duration of lithium therapy (in increasing order). A cumulative meta-analysis is defined as the product of performing a new meta-analysis every time a new trial is added to a series of trials. The contribution of individual studies to the cumulatively pooled results can readily be determined. Cumulative meta-analysis can show under what conditions treatment has been proven effective, ineffective, or harmful.34 As a further sensitivity analysis, the pooling of the odds ratios was also performed using methods described by Woolf 35 and Yusuf and associates.36 Additionally a pooled risk ratio and a pooled risk difference were calculated using methods summarized by Fleiss.33 The number of patients who must be treated to produce one additional responder (number needed to treat) was determined by the reciprocal of the pooled absolute difference. No formal test for statistical significance was performed, but when the 95% confidence interval of the odds- or risk-ratio estimate did not contain the value \"1,\" statistical significance at the level of [alpha] = 0.05 was concluded.\nIt is generally accepted that meta-analyses should only include studies of high quality. Therefore, according to predetermined definitions, we first collected only those studies that used a minimum dose of 800 mg/day,22 or a dose sufficient to reach lithium serum levels of >=0.5 mEq/L, and a minimum duration of treatment of 2 weeks for inclusion in a confirmatory meta-analysis. Second, we performed an overall meta-analysis including all studies to confirm the results obtained in the first step.\n回到顶端\nResults\nEleven placebo-controlled, double-blind studies were identified: five 17-19, 37, 38 by the use of MEDLINE, including three that also appeared in the Cochrane Library,17, 18, 37 and the others by searching manually. The study by Cournoyer and associates,39 which according to our literature research has only been published as an abstract, was not included in the meta-analysis because no response criteria were given. In this study, 12 patients with major depressive disorder (RDC and DSM-III) were considered tricyclic antidepressant-resistant after 21 days of treatment with amitriptyline or trimipramine (200 mg/day) and entered a 48-hour double-blind crossover study. Significant improvement occurred with lithium, but not with placebo.39 The article by Stein and Bernadt 40 from 1988 that was presented at the Second British Lithium Congress was excluded because it showed preliminary data that were published in full in 1993.19 Details of nine studies included in the meta-analysis-including patient characteristics, initial antidepressant therapy, study design and therapy, lithium dose, diagnostic classification, response criteria, response rates, and the quality score as judged by the investigators (M. B., S. D.)-are given in Table 1.\t\nTable 1 Table 1Opens a popup window\t\nOpens a popup window\t\nOpens a popup window\nAll studies presented some limitations in quality. One study did not report randomization of patients,41 one study used a quasi-randomized patient allocation,42 and in those trials that did randomize, the method of randomization is stated only in two studies.19,20 The number of patients excluded from the study and the reasons for the exclusion are given in only four studies.17, 18, 41, 43 A sample-size justification could be found in only one study,18 and none of the negative trials reported post hoc power calculations. All but one trial 42 stated inclusion criteria. These inclusion criteria were very similar among the studies, except for the requirement of a minimal residual score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) before the initiation of study medication, which ranged from >=12 43 to >18.19, 20, 41 Patients were treated for 3 to 6 weeks with an antidepressant drug before the start of the lithium or placebo study medication. The lithium dose used in the trials (or in the placebo-controlled parts of the trials) widely ranged from 250 mg/day 19 to 1,200 mg/day.17, 42 Lithium serum levels were determined in eight studies,17-20, 37, 38, 42 and in five of them the dose was adjusted to the serum level that is usually proposed for prophylactic treatment of affective illness (range in studies, 0.5-1.1 mEq/L).17, 18, 20, 37, 42 One study allowed for an increase in dose according to the patients' response.43 The duration of the placebo-controlled treatment period ranged from 48 hours 38, 41 to 6 weeks.18\nAll studies rated depression severity using the HAM-D except for the study by Heninger and associates,42 which used the Short Clinical Rating Scale (SCRS), a 15-point nurse-rated psychopathology scale. Response criterion in most of the studies was a relative decrease in the HAM-D score. Heninger and associates 42 defined response as a decrease of two or more points on the SCRS, and Zusky and associates 43 defined it as a final HAM-D score of 7 or less. Katona and associates 18 and Joffe and associates 17 used the most stringent criteria of a >=50% decrease in HAM-D and a final HAM-D score of less than 10. The response rate in the placebo group ranged from 0%37, 41, 42 to 25%,18, 43 with a median of 18.7%; the response rate in the lithium group ranged from 12.5%19 to 62.5%,42 with a median of 50.0% (for details, see Table 1).\nFor confirmatory purposes, only those studies that used a minimum dose of 800 mg/day, or a dose sufficient to reach lithium serum levels of >=0.5 mEq/L,22 and a minimum duration of treatment of 2 weeks were to be combined. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed first using the results of three studies by Joffe and associates,17 Katona and associates,18 and Zusky and associates.43 No significant heterogeneity could be found (p = 0.851). The response rate during lithium administration was more than tripled compared with that during placebo treatment when expressed as an odds ratio, and it was more than doubled when expressed as a relative risk (\"risk\" here meaning the proportion of responders in each group). The corresponding pooled absolute difference in response rate was 27%, and the number of patients needed to be treated to obtain one additional responder was 3.7. The pooling of all studies for explorative purposes in a second meta-analysis resulted in even higher estimates (for details, see Table 2). Again, no statistically significant heterogeneity could be found (p = 0.119).\t\nTable 2 Table 2Opens a popup window\t\nOpens a popup window\t\nOpens a popup window\nTwo cumulative meta-analyses were performed: one by increasing the lithium dose and the other by increasing the duration of lithium therapy (Figs. 1A and B).\t\nFig. 1 Fig. 1Opens a popup window\t\nOpens a popup window\t\nOpens a popup window\n1. By increasing the lithium dose: Figure 1A shows a typical and cumulative meta-analysis with the studies arranged by increasing lithium doses. The cumulative meta-analysis clearly demonstrates a significant lithium effect from a dose of 600 to 800 mg/day onward. Higher doses do not substantially alter the result.\n2. By increasing the duration of lithium therapy: The cumulative meta-analysis performed on studies in which the duration of lithium treatment was increased demonstrates a significant lithium effect from the point of including studies of at least 7 days' duration (Fig. 1B). The studies of 1 to 2 weeks' duration show an overestimation of the lithium effect, which might be due to the fact that three of these trials had no responders in the placebo group (see Table 1).\n回到顶端\nDiscussion\nThis meta-analysis provides firm evidence that lithium augmentation has a statistically significant effect on the response rate compared with the effects of placebo. Pooling of the results of the three studies 17, 18, 43 that used both sufficient dose (minimum dose of 800 mg/day or a dose sufficient to reach lithium serum levels of >=0.5 mEq/L) and duration of therapy (at least 2 weeks) showed clear-cut benefits with lithium augmentation. This result remained stable when the other six studies were added that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. Under the assumption that there is no true lithium effect, we performed simulation studies to determine how large a trial with an individual odds ratio of approximately 1 (i.e., no difference between lithium and placebo) would have to be so that the result of the meta-analysis would be non-significant when included. Assuming a response rate of 20% in both groups, a negative, new study would have to include 2,500 patients per group to result in a non-significant meta-analysis with a power of 80%. For a power of 90%, more than 6,000 patients per group would be required.\nOn the other hand, five of the nine trials did not individually show a significant effect of lithium augmentation.19, 38, 41-43 This finding requires some further discussion. The studies by Kantor and associates 41 and Browne and associates 38 compared lithium with placebo for only 48 hours. Possibly this short duration was chosen because of the initially positive results reported by de Montigny and associates in 1981.11 However, as already outlined by de Montigny 10 in his review, later studies did not confirm this rapid response, although in rare cases, fast improvements in the first days after lithium addition could be observed. Moreover, a clinically significant effect after 48 hours would not be expected by any known antidepressant drug. Stein and Bernadt 19 used a dose of only 250 mg/day in the placebo-controlled first 3 weeks of the trial. This dose is usually not sufficient to reach lithium serum levels required for adequate prophylactic treatment of affective disorders.44 Indeed, Stein and Bernadt 19 found a mean lithium serum level of 0.25 mmol/L after 1 week of treatment with 250 mg/day. We did not make use of the data from the following 6 weeks of this study because after the first 3 weeks, all of the subjects received lithium, either 250 mg/day or 750 mg/day. It should be mentioned that the comparison of the two dose groups resulted in a significantly higher response rate in the higher dose group (15 of 34 patients responded to lithium 750 mg, compared with 6 of 34 who at some point in the study received lithium 250 mg/day and responded; p < 0.001, McNemar test).\nAnother problem that remains is the variety of response criteria used in the nine trials. Most often, a definition of clinical response based on a 50% (or 40%) decrease in the HAM-D was adopted. A relative change alone might not be stringent enough, and a final value of less than 10 should also be required. The data provided in the publications did not allow a reevaluation using this definition, but the trials by Katona and associates 18 and Joffe and associates,17 who used this definition, resulted in a significant treatment effect of lithium augmentation.\nRegarding the question of whether the lithium augmentation effect is limited to any class of antidepressants, no sufficient information could be gained from the studies. In most of the trials, patients were treated with tricyclic antidepressants; only two studies used an SSRI.18, 20 However, in those studies that used different classes of antidepressants, it was not differentiated who of the responders had been taking which antidepressant. One trial studied a tricyclic and an SSRI; no differences in the efficacy of lithium augmentation were apparent between lofepramine and fluoxetine in the study by Katona and associates.18 Only 14 of the 234 patients were reported to have bipolar depression (see Table 1). Therefore, no conclusion could be drawn as to whether bipolar patients are more or less likely responders compared with unipolar depressed patients.\nAccording to this literature research, lithium augmentation seems to be the treatment strategy in refractory depression that has being investigated most frequently in placebo-controlled, double-blind studies. Triiodothyronine augmentation, another frequently applied treatment strategy in refractory depression, has only been studied in three placebo-controlled, double-blind studies with contradictory results. A recent meta-analysis by Aronson and associates 7 showed no significant effects when only randomized double-blind studies were pooled. As a conclusion of this meta-analysis, we recommend lithium augmentation with respect to efficacy as a first-choice treatment for depressed patients who do not respond to therapy with conventional antidepressants. Study results indicate that lithium augmentation should be applied for a minimum of 7 days at doses that are sufficient to reach lithium serum levels of >=0.5 mEq/L.\n回到顶端\nAcknowledgment\nWe thank Drs.

It also examines hypotheses on the mode of action of lithium augmentation, with a focus on serotonin (5-HT) and neuroendocrine systems, and proposes recommendations for future research. METHOD: We searched the Medline computer database and the Cochrane Library for relevant original studies published in English from January 1966 to February 2003. The key words were as follows: lithium, augmentation strategies, lithium augmentation, major depression, refractory depression, treatment-resistant depression, neuroendocrinology, and serotonin. RESULTS: Of 27 prospective clinical studies published since 1981, 10 were double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, 4 were randomized comparator trials, and 13 were open-label trials. Five of 9 acute-phase placebo-controlled trials demonstrated that lithium augmentation had substantial efficacy. In the acute-treatment trials, the average response rate in the lithium group was 45%, and in the placebo group, 18% (P < 0.001). One placebo-controlled trial showed the efficacy of lithium augmentation in the continuation-phase treatment. Summarizing the open and controlled data, approximately 50% of patients responded to lithium augmentation within 2 to 6 weeks. Animal studies offer robust evidence that lithium augmentation increases 5-HT neurotransmission, possibly by a synergistic action of lithium and the antidepressant on brain 5-HT pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Augmentation of antidepressants with lithium is the best-documented augmentation therapy in the treatment of refractory depression. Emerging data from animal studies suggest that the 5-HTergic system is involved in the augmentatory effect of lithium.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bauer M ; Adli M ; Baethge C ; Berghöfer A ; Sasse J ; Heinz A ; Bschor T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/070674370304800703 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nAntimanic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nBrain/*drug effects/physiopathology\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/drug effects/physiopathology\r\nLithium Compounds/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System/drug effects/physiopathology\r\nSerotonin/*metabolism\r\nSynaptic Transmission/*drug effects/physiology\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bauer M, Adli M, Baethge C, Berghöfer A, Sasse J, Heinz A, and Bschor T (2003) Lithium augmentation therapy in refractory depression: clinical evidence and neurobiological mechanisms..

The present study examines whether evidence exists to support the clinical efficacy of lithium augmentation in refractory, treatment resistant depression. Studies were identified by searching Medline (1980 to August 2002) and by scanning the references of published reviews and standard textbooks. Studies were selected if they were open-labeled or double-blind, placebo-controlled or comparator trials that involved patients who had not responded to conventional antidepressants. 27 prospective studies were identified that included a total of 803 depressed patients displaying the following designs: 10 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, 2 randomized, double-blind comparator trials, 2 randomized, open comparator trials, and 13 open-label trials. The majority of randomized controlled trials has demonstrated substantial efficacy of lithium augmentation in partial and non responders to antidepressant treatment. In the placebo-controlled trials, the response rate in the lithium group was 45% and in the placebo group 18% (p<0.001). Summarizing all open and controlled studies, approximately 50% of patients responded to lithium augmentation within 4 weeks. In conclusion, lithium is the foremost and most well-documented augmentation strategy in refractory depression.Therefore, it should be considered a first-line treatment strategy in patients with major depression who do not adequately respond to standard antidepressants.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bauer M ; Forsthoff A ; Baethge C ; Adli M ; Berghöfer A ; Döpfmer S ; Bschor T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00406-003-0430-9 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMEDLINE/instrumentation/statistics & numerical data\r\nMale\r\nMeta-Analysis as Topic\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNeurosecretory Systems/physiopathology\r\nPredictive Value of Tests\r\nProspective Studies\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nRecurrence","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bauer M, Forsthoff A, Baethge C, Adli M, Berghöfer A, Döpfmer S, and Bschor T (2003) Lithium augmentation therapy in refractory depression-update 2002..

Therefore, there is a critical need for effective medication strategies that augment treatment with antidepressants. METHODS: To review the available evidence on the use of lithium as an augmentation strategy to treat depressive episodes. RESULTS: More than 30 open-label studies and 10 placebo-controlled double-blind trials have demonstrated substantial efficacy of lithium augmentation in the acute treatment of depressive episodes. Most of these studies were performed in unipolar depression and included all major classes of antidepressants, however mostly tricyclics. A meta-analysis including 10 randomized placebo-controlled trials has provided evidence that lithium augmentation has a statistically significant effect on the response rate compared to placebo with an odds ratio of 3.11, which corresponds to a number-needed-to-treat of 5. The meta-analysis revealed a mean response rate of 41.2% in the lithium group and 14.4% in the placebo group. One placebo-controlled trial in the continuation treatment phase showed that responders to acute-phase lithium augmentation should be maintained on the lithium-antidepressant combination for at least 12 months to prevent early relapses. Preliminary studies to assess genetic influences on response probability to lithium augmentation have suggested a predictive role of the -50T/C single nucleotide polymorphism of the GSK3beta gene. CONCLUSION: Augmentation of antidepressants with lithium is currently the best-evidenced augmentation therapy in the treatment of depressed patients who do not respond to antidepressants.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bauer M ; Adli M ; Bschor T ; Pilhatsch M ; Pfennig A ; Sasse J ; Schmid R ; Lewitzka U ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000314308 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination/methods\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bauer M, Adli M, Bschor T, Pilhatsch M, Pfennig A, Sasse J, Schmid R, and Lewitzka U (2010) Lithium's emerging role in the treatment of refractory major depressive episodes: augmentation of antidepressants..

METHODS: This 6-week, randomised, open-label, rater-blinded trial evaluated once-daily extended-release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR; 300 mg/day) as add-on to ongoing antidepressant and quetiapine XR monotherapy (300 mg/day) compared with add-on lithium (0.6-1.2 mmol/L) in patients with treatment-resistant MDD. Primary efficacy measure: change in Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from randomisation to week 6 with a pre-specified non-inferiority limit of 3 points on the MADRS. RESULTS: At week 6, both add-on quetiapine XR (n=231) and quetiapine XR monotherapy (n=228) were non-inferior to add-on lithium (n=229); least squares means (LSM) differences (97.5% CI) in MADRS total score changes were -2.32 (-4.6, -0.05) and -0.97 (-3.24, 1.31), respectively. LSM MADRS total score change was numerically greater at day 4 for both quetiapine XR groups (add-on and monotherapy; p<0.01) compared with add-on lithium. At week 6, the differences between groups for the secondary endpoints of MADRS response (≥ 50% reduction in total score), MADRS remission (total score ≤ 10, add-on quetiapine XR only) and Clinical Global Impressions ('much'/'very much' improved) were numerically similar. Overall tolerability was consistent with the known profiles of both treatments. LIMITATIONS: Limitations included the open-label study design (although MADRS and laboratory measurements were performed by treatment-blinded raters) and relatively short study duration with no assessments in the continuation phase.

Clinical guidelines recommend lithium augmentation as a first-line treatment strategy for non-responding depressed patients. The objectives of this review were to discuss the current place of lithium augmentation in the management of treatment-resistant depression and to review novel findings concerning lithium's mechanisms of action. We conducted a comprehensive and critical review of randomized, placebo-controlled trials, controlled and naturalistic comparator studies, and continuation-phase and discontinuation studies of lithium augmentation in major depression. The outcomes of interest were efficacy, factors allowing outcome prediction and results from preclinical studies investigating molecular mechanisms of lithium action. Substantial efficacy of lithium augmentation in the acute treatment of major depression has been demonstrated in more than 30 open-label studies and 10 placebo-controlled trials. In a meta-analysis addressing the efficacy of lithium in 10 randomized, controlled trials, it had a significant positive effect versus placebo, with an odds ratio of 3.11 corresponding to a number-needed-to-treat (NNT) of 5 and a mean response rate of 41.2% (versus 14.4% in the placebo group). The main limitations of these studies were the relatively small numbers of study participants and the fact that most studies included augmentation of tricyclic antidepressants, which are not in widespread use anymore. Evidence from continuation-phase studies is sparse but suggests that lithium augmentation should be maintained in the lithium-antidepressant combination for at least 1 year to prevent early relapses. Concerning outcome prediction, single studies have reported associations of better outcome rates with more severe depressive symptomatology, significant weight loss, psychomotor retardation, a history of more than three major depressive episodes and a family history of major depression. Additionally, one study suggested a predictive role of the -50T/C single nucleotide polymorphism of the glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B) gene in the probability of response to lithium augmentation. With regard to novel mechanisms of action, GABAergic, neurotrophic and genetic effects might explain the effects of lithium augmentation. In conclusion, augmentation of antidepressants with lithium remains a first-line, evidence-based management option for patients with major depression who have not responded adequately to antidepressants. While the mechanisms of action are currently widely studied, further clinical research on the role of lithium potentiation of the current generation of antidepressants is warranted to reinforce its role as a gold-standard treatment for patients who respond inadequately to antidepressants.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bauer M ; Adli M ; Ricken R ; Severus E ; Pilhatsch M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s40263-014-0152-8 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\n*Disease Management\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*administration & dosage\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic/methods","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bauer M, Adli M, Ricken R, Severus E, and Pilhatsch M (2014) Role of lithium augmentation in the management of major depressive disorder..

Among them, 45 responded to treatment (improvement > 50% on the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D]) and continued their treatment for another week before being released from the study. The 24 nonresponders were randomized and comedicated under double-blind conditions with lithium carbonate (Li) (2 x 400 mg/day) (CIT-Li group) or with placebo (CIT-Pl group) from days 29 to 35. For days 36 to 42, the patients of both subgroups were treated openly with Li (800 mg/day) in addition to the ongoing CIT treatment. On day 35, 6 of 10 patients responded to the CIT-Li combination, whereas 2 of 14 patients only responded to the CIT-Pl combination. This group difference reached significance (p < 0.05) on day 35 with lower HAM-D total scores in the CIT-Li group. No evidence was seen of a pharmacokinetic interaction between CIT and Li, and this combination was well tolerated. Patients were phenotyped with dextromethorphan and mephenytoin at baseline and at day 28. As evaluated at baseline, three patients (responders) were poor metabolizers of dextromethorphan and six patients (three responders and three nonresponders) of mephenytoin. On day 28, the ratio CIT/N-desmethylCIT (DCIT) in plasma was significantly higher in poor than in extensive metabolizers of mephenytoin (p = 0.0001), and there was a significant positive correlation between the metabolic ratio of dextromethorphan and the ratio DCIT/N-didesmethylCIT in plasma (p < 0.001). These findings illustrate the role of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 in the metabolism of CIT. It can be concluded that Li addition to CIT is effective in patients not responding to CIT alone without any evidence of an accentuation or provocation of adverse events.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baumann P ; Nil R ; Souche A ; Montaldi S ; Baettig D ; Lambert S ; Uehlinger C ; Kasas A ; Amey M ; Jonzier-Perey M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00004714-199608000-00006 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\n*Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases\r\nCitalopram/*administration & dosage/blood/*metabolism\r\nCytochrome P-450 CYP2C19\r\nCytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/genetics/*metabolism\r\nCytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/*metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/genetics\r\nDextromethorphan/metabolism\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Interactions\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*administration & dosage\r\nMale\r\nMephenytoin/metabolism\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMixed Function Oxygenases/genetics/*metabolism\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/*administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baumann P, Nil R, Souche A, Montaldi S, Baettig D, Lambert S, Uehlinger C, Kasas A, Amey M, and Jonzier-Perey M (1996) A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of citalopram with and without lithium in the treatment of therapy-resistant depressive patients: a clinical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic investigation..

Moreover, newer theories of antidepressant action suggest that a reduction in beta-adrenergic receptor sensitivity is a better correlate of antidepressant treatment than noradrenaline turnover changes. It is possible to evaluate the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase complex in the human periphery by measuring the plasma cyclic AMP rise after adrenergic agonists. A clinical trial of the beta-2 adrenergic agonist salbutamol in depression provided an opportunity to test whether adrenergic receptor subsensitivity does occur during clinical antidepressant treatment. Plasma cyclic AMP before treatment with salbutamol rose 26% in response to salbutamol 0.25 mg iv. After 1 and 3 weeks of oral salbutamol treatment, depression scores declined significantly in 11 depressed patients, while the plasma cyclic AMP response to iv salbutamol declined over 60%. The beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase remained subsensitive 4 days after cessation of salbutamol therapy. The results support the concept that receptor sensitivity changes occur during human antidepressant therapy. Data are presented that Li, too, markedly reduces activity of beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase in humans. The effect was evaluated by studying the effect of Li at therapeutic serum concentrations on the plasma cyclic AMP response to subcutaneous epinephrine. The Li effect is specific, since the plasma cyclic AMP response to glucagon is not inhibited. The plasma cyclic GMP response to subcutaneous epinephrine, suggested as a model for presynaptic alpha-noradrenergic mechanisms, is also partially inhibited by Li therapy. Since cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP may be viewed as balancing substances, their interaction may provide a mechanism for Li's dual clinical effects in mania and depression. It is important that in vivo techniques be developed for evaluating receptor changes. The plasma cyclic AMP response to adrenergic stimulation provides an in vivo measure of receptor function that can be useful in studying drug effects during the clinical treatment of humans.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Belmaker RH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adenylyl Cyclases/*blood\r\nAlbuterol/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/enzymology\r\nCyclic AMP/blood\r\nCyclic GMP/pharmacology\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/enzymology\r\nEpinephrine/administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nNorepinephrine/blood\r\nReceptors, Adrenergic/*drug effects\r\nReceptors, Adrenergic, beta/*drug effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Belmaker RH (1981) Receptors, adenylate cyclase, depression, and lithium..

In the present study we studied the effect of a single TSD followed by 3 days SPA (beginning with sleep allowed from 17:00 until 24:00, with daily shiftbacks of 2 h) in consecutively admitted bipolar depressed inpatients who were taking a chronic lithium salts treatment (n=16) or who were devoid of psychotropic medications (n=14). Changes in mood during treatment were recorded with self administered visual analogue scales and with Hamilton rating scale for depression. Results showed that SPA could sustain the acute antidepressant effect of TSD, and that lithium enhanced the effect of the chronobiological treatment. According to the internal coincidence model, the better clinical effects observed in lithium-treated patients could be due to the phase delaying effect of lithium on biological rhythms, leading to a better synchronization of biological rhythms with the sleep-wake cycle.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Benedetti F ; Barbini B ; Campori E ; Fulgosi MC ; Pontiggia A ; Colombo C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0022-3956(01)00034-6 ","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*complications/*drug therapy\r\nCircadian Rhythm/drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nSleep Deprivation/*drug therapy\r\nSleep Disorders, Circadian Rhythm/*complications\r\nTime Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Benedetti F, Barbini B, Campori E, Fulgosi MC, Pontiggia A, and Colombo C (2001) Sleep phase advance and lithium to sustain the antidepressant effect of total sleep deprivation in bipolar depression: new findings supporting the internal coincidence model?.

Suicidality in major depressive disorder and in schizophrenia has been associated with reduced gray matter volumes in orbitofrontal cortex. Lithium reduces the suicide risk of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) to the same levels of the general population, and can increase GM volumes. We studied the effect of a positive history of attempted suicide and ongoing lithium treatment on regional GM volumes of patients affected by bipolar depression. METHODS: With a correlational design, we studied 57 currently depressed inpatients with bipolar disorder: 19 with and 38 without a positive history of suicide attempts, 39 unmedicated and 18 with ongoing lithium treatment. Total and regional gray matter volumes were assessed using voxel-based morphometry. RESULTS: Total GM volume is inversely correlated with depression severity. A positive history of suicide attempts was associated with higher stress in early life. Suicide attempters showed reduced GM volumes in several brain areas including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, superior temporal cortex, parieto-occipital cortex, and basal ganglia. Long term lithium treatment was associated with increased GM volumes in the same areas where suicide was associated with decreased GM. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced GM volumes in critical cortical areas of suicidal patients could be a biological correlate of an impaired ability to associate choices and outcomes and to plan goal-directed behaviors based on a lifetime historical perspective, which, coupled with mood-congruent depressive cognitive distortions, could lead to more hopelessness and suicide. Lithium could exert its specific therapeutic effect on suicide by acting in the same areas.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Benedetti F ; Radaelli D ; Poletti S ; Locatelli C ; Falini A ; Colombo C ; Smeraldi E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2011.07.006 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*pathology/psychology\r\nCase-Control Studies\r\nCerebral Cortex/anatomy & histology/drug effects/*pathology\r\nDecision Making\r\nDepression\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy/psychology\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nGoals\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMood Disorders/drug therapy\r\nOrgan Size\r\nPrefrontal Cortex\r\nSuicide\r\nSuicide, Attempted/*psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Benedetti F, Radaelli D, Poletti S, Locatelli C, Falini A, Colombo C, and Smeraldi E (2011) Opposite effects of suicidality and lithium on gray matter volumes in bipolar depression..

We aimed to replicate a regimen that induces robust antidepressant effects in the forced-swim test. Mice were treated with three different doses of lithium chloride (LiCl) 0.25, 0.4 or 0.5% in food and the forced-swim test or open field test was performed on day 15. We yoked control mice to food deprivation to test whether lithium-induced food deprivation could cause the lithium effects in the forced-swim test. Treatment with LiCl doses leading to blood levels of 1.3 and 1.4 mmol/l led to highly significant reduction in immobility time in the forced-swim test, but the dose leading to a blood level of 0.8 mmol/l was not different from controls in immobility time. Mice yoked to lithium-induced food deprivation showed no difference in the forced-swim test compared with controls. In conclusion these results suggest that lithium effects in mice in the forced-swim test are dose dependent but not owing to lithium-induced weight loss.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bersudsky Y ; Shaldubina A ; Belmaker RH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/FBP.0b013e32801416ed ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nEscape Reaction/*drug effects/*physiology\r\nFood Deprivation\r\n*Helplessness, Learned\r\nLithium Chloride/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred ICR\r\nMotor Activity/*drug effects/*physiology\r\nSwimming/psychology\r\nWeight Loss/*drug effects/*physiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bersudsky Y, Shaldubina A, and Belmaker RH (2007) Lithium's effect in forced-swim test is blood level dependent but not dependent on weight loss..

The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of zinc on the status of various neurotransmitters as well as behavioral patterns of lithium-treated rats. The study was designed with a view to find out whether zinc affords protection to brain against lithium toxicity. 2. Animals were segregated into four different groups. Animals in group I were fed with standard laboratory feed and water ad libitum and served as normal controls. Animals in group II and IV were given lithium in the form of lithium carbonate in their diet at a dose level of 1.1 g/Kg diet. Animals in group III and IV were given zinc treatment in the form of zinc sulfate at a dose level of 227 mg/L mixed in drinking water of animals. 3. The effects of all the treatments were studied for a duration of 1, 2, and 4 months with regard to the parameters, which included estimation of serotonin and dopamine concentrations as well as the activity of acetylcholinesterase in cerebral cortex of rat brain. Further, passive avoidance, active avoidance, and behavior despair tests were conducted to assess the short-term memory, cognitive behavior, and psychomotor dysfunction of the animals, respectively. 4. Initially, a decrease in the acetylcholinesterase activity was reported in cerebral cortex followed by an increase in the enzyme activity after 2 and 4 months of lithium treatment. Serotonin concentration significantly decreased after 2 and 4 months of lithium treatment, whereas dopamine concentration increased significantly after 4 months of lithium treatment. Zinc administration to the lithium-treated group significantly improved the acetylcholinesterase activity as well as the concentration of dopamine and serotonin. Further, lithium-treated rats showed an increase in depression time as compared to normal controls both after 1 and 4 months of treatment. Short-term memory significantly improved in lithium-treated rats in all treatment groups. However, no change in the cognitive behavior of the animals was reported after lithium treatment. Zinc co-administration with lithium significantly improved the short-term memory and cognitive functions of the animals. From the above results it can be concluded that zinc proved beneficial in altering the status of neurotransmitters as well as the behavior patters of the animals treated with both short and long-term lithium therapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bhalla P ; Chadha VD ; Dhawan DK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s10571-007-9146-0 ","Keywords":"Acetylcholinesterase/metabolism\r\nAnimals\r\nAntimanic Agents/*toxicity\r\nAvoidance Learning/drug effects\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBrain Chemistry/drug effects\r\nCerebral Cortex/*drug effects/physiology\r\nDopamine/metabolism\r\nDrug Interactions\r\nLithium Carbonate/*toxicity\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nTrace Elements/*pharmacology\r\nZinc/*pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bhalla P, Chadha VD, and Dhawan DK (2007) Effectiveness of zinc in modulating lithium induced biochemical and behavioral changes in rat brain..

In this study we investigated the neuroprotective effects of lithium in gerbils subjected to global cerebral ischemia, an animal model of stroke. The ischemia-induced exploratory behavior changes, measured by open field testing, were largely suppressed by lithium treatment for 7 days prior to ischemic onset. Similarly, memory impairments, measured by T-maze testing, were prevented by lithium pretreatment. This is believed to be the first report of lithium-induced protection against hyperactivity in a novel open field and memory impairment in a gerbil model of global ischemia. These behavioral benefits were associated with an increase in viable cells as measured by hematoxylin and eosin staining and a decrease in apoptotic TUNEL-positive cells in the CA1 hippocampal area of ischemic gerbils. Moreover, the lithium-induced neuroprotection was accompanied by down-regulation of pro-apoptotic p53 in the CA1 but up-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in the ischemic brain. These results underscore the ability of lithium to improve functional behavioral outcome in gerbil and rodent cerebral ischemic models and further indicate the potential therapeutic use of lithium in certain human stroke conditions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bian Q ; Shi T ; Chuang DM ; Qian Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.brainres.2007.09.054 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nBehavioral Symptoms/etiology/*prevention & control\r\nBrain Injuries/*pathology/*prevention & control\r\nCell Death/drug effects\r\nGerbillinae\r\nHSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism\r\nHippocampus/*drug effects/pathology\r\nIn Situ Nick-End Labeling/methods\r\nIschemia/complications\r\nLithium Compounds/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nProto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism\r\nTime Factors\r\nTumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bian Q, Shi T, Chuang DM, and Qian Y (2007) Lithium reduces ischemia-induced hippocampal CA1 damage and behavioral deficits in gerbils..

In normal subjects receiving lithium for two weeks total sleep time did not vary, REM sleep decreased and REM sleep latency increased. In depressed subjects, either on short therm therapy or on long term therapy stages 3 and 4 increased, REM sleep decreased, REM latency increased and REM activity/time spent asleep (an index of REM intensity per minute of sleep) decreased. Plasma lithium levels were negatively correlated with REM sleep percentage and positively correlated with REM sleep latency. Besides, it has been shown in one paper that short term therapy with lithium caused small but significant delays in the sleep-wake circadian rhythm. These effects are of interest in view of polygraphic sleep abnormalities found in affective disorders and possible circadian disturbances accounting for these abnormalities. Indeed lithium might act in correcting spezial sleep abnormalities and/or circadian disturbances. In addition to its predominant use for the prophylaxis of recurrent mania and depression, lithium carbonate has been proposed and tried in the prophylactic treatment of abnormally prolonged sleep episodes featuring the Kleine-Levin syndrome.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Billiard M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1055/s-2007-1017102 ","Keywords":"Circadian Rhythm/drug effects\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*pharmacology\r\nSleep/*drug effects\r\nSleep Wake Disorders/drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Billiard M (1987) Lithium carbonate: effects on sleep patterns of normal and depressed subjects and its use in sleep-wake pathology..

METHOD: Depressed inpatients, meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder, were enrolled in the algorithm that consisted of sequential treatment steps (washout period, anti-depressant monotherapy, lithium addition, treatment with a nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitor, electroconvulsive therapy). Definition of nonresponse and progression through the steps of the algorithm was dependent on the score on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) at predefined evaluation times. Patients were admitted from April 1997 through July 2001. RESULTS: Of the 203 patients studied, 149 were treated according to the full algorithm, and 54 patients were immediately entered into step 3. Of the 203 patients, 165 (81%) achieved response (> or = 50% reduction in HAM-D score) and 101 (50%) remitted (final HAM-D score < or = 7). Of the 149 patients treated according to the full algorithm, 129 (87%) responded and 89 (60%) remitted. Twenty-four patients (16%) dropped out from the algorithm. CONCLUSION: Although response with antidepressant monotherapy was less than 50%, successive treatment according to the 4-step algorithm was very effective in a sample of depressed inpatients. The adherence to the algorithm was good as shown by a low dropout rate. This study emphasizes the importance of persisting with standardized antidepressant treatment in patients who are initially nonresponders to the first antidepressant. By the end of the study, more than 80% of the patients responded and 50% achieved full remission.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Birkenhäger TK ; van den Broek WW ; Moleman P ; Bruijn JA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/jcp.v67n0814 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\n*Algorithms\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nClinical Protocols\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nFeasibility Studies\r\nFemale\r\n*Hospitalization\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/therapeutic use\r\nPatient Compliance\r\nPatient Dropouts\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales/statistics & numerical data\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Birkenhäger TK, van den Broek WW, Moleman P, and Bruijn JA (2006) Outcome of a 4-step treatment algorithm for depressed inpatients..

Mounting evidence suggests that oxidative stress is implicated in the pathophysiology of this syndrome. The development of effective pharmacological interventions for the depression-pain syndrome is of particular importance as clinical treatments for this comorbidity have shown limited efficacy. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate whether the 3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-4-(phenylselanyl)-1H-pyrazole (SePy) was able to reverse the depression-pain syndrome induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) streptozotocin (STZ) in mice and the possible modulation of oxidative and nitrergic pathways in its effect. The treatment with SePy (1 and 10 mg/kg) administered intragastrically (i.g.) reversed the increased immobility time in the tail suspension test, decreased grooming time in the splash test, latency time to nociceptive response in the hot plate test, and the response frequency of Von Frey hair (VFH) stimulation induced by STZ (0.2 mg/4 μl/per mouse). Additionally, SePy (10 mg/kg, i.g.) reversed STZ-induced alterations in the levels of reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and lipid peroxidation and the superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in the prefrontal cortices (PFC) and hippocampi (HC) of mice. Treatment with SePy (10 mg/kg, i.g.) also reversed the STZ-induced increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) in the PFC and HC. An additional molecular docking investigation found that SePy binds to the active site of iNOS and GSK3β. Altogether, these results indicate that the antidepressant-like effect of SePy is accompanied by decreased hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, which were associated with its antioxidant effect.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Birmann PT ; Casaril AM ; Hartwig D ; Jacob RG ; Seixas FK ; Collares T ; Savegnago L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.brainres.2020.146880 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nDepression/chemically induced/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/chemistry/metabolism\r\nInjections, Intraventricular\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nNitric Oxide Synthase Type II/chemistry/metabolism\r\nNitrosative Stress/*drug effects/physiology\r\nOxidative Stress/*drug effects/physiology\r\nPain/chemically induced/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nPain Measurement/drug effects/methods\r\nProtein Structure, Secondary\r\nPyrazoles/*administration & dosage\r\nSelenium/*administration & dosage\r\nStreptozocin/administration & dosage/toxicity\r\nDepression\r\nOxidative stress\r\nPain\r\nPyrazole\r\nSelenium","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Birmann PT, Casaril AM, Hartwig D, Jacob RG, Seixas FK, Collares T, and Savegnago L (2020) A novel pyrazole-containing selenium compound modulates the oxidative and nitrergic pathways to reverse the depression-pain syndrome in mice..

We aimed to investigate the prospective association between dietary intakes of Zn and Mg and internalising and externalising behaviour problems in a population-based cohort of adolescents. DESIGN: Prospective analysis (general linear mixed models) of dietary intakes of Zn and Mg assessed using a validated FFQ and mental health symptoms assessed using the Youth Self-Report (YSR), adjusting for sex, physical activity, family income, supplement status, dietary misreporting, BMI, family functioning and energy intake. SETTING: Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. SUBJECTS: Adolescents (n 684) at the 14- and 17-year follow-ups. RESULTS: Higher dietary intake of Mg (per SD increase) was significantly associated with reduced externalising behaviours (β = -1.45; 95% CI -2.40, -0.50; P = 0.003). There was a trend towards reduced externalising behaviours with higher Zn intake (per SD increase; β = -0.73; 95% CI -1.57, 0.10; P = 0.085). CONCLUSIONS: The study shows an association between higher dietary Mg intake and reduced externalising behaviour problems in adolescents. We observed a similar trend, although not statistically significant, for Zn intake. Randomised controlled trials are necessary to determine any benefit of micronutrient supplementation in the prevention and treatment of mental health problems in adolescents.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Black LJ ; Allen KL ; Jacoby P ; Trapp GS ; Gallagher CM ; Byrne SM ; Oddy WH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S1368980014002432 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\n*Adolescent Behavior\r\nAnxiety/prevention & control\r\nAustralia\r\nChild Behavior Disorders/*prevention & control\r\nDepression/prevention & control\r\n*Diet\r\nEnergy Intake\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMagnesium/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nMagnesium Deficiency/*prevention & control\r\nMale\r\nProspective Studies\r\nSelf-Control\r\nZinc/administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nDietary intake\r\nMagnesium\r\nMental health\r\nRaine Study","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Black LJ, Allen KL, Jacoby P, Trapp GS, Gallagher CM, Byrne SM, and Oddy WH (2015) Low dietary intake of magnesium is associated with increased externalising behaviours in adolescents..

It was based on a search of the medical literature and a review of randomized clinical trials. The literature shows that antidepressant medications and, to a lesser extent, psychotherapy are both effective in preventing recurrence of major depression. Lithium and carbamazepine may also be effective. Antidepressant medications are probably more effective at full therapeutic doses than at the lower doses initially advised for maintenance treatment. Based on this review, maintenance treatment should be considered for any patient with recurrent major depression. It is clearly indicated in individuals with multiple frequent episodes. Patients with less-severe illness must weight the risks and benefits of treatment in light of their earlier course and symptoms, the current impact of treatment, and the likely future impact of additional episodes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Blacker D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3109/10673229609030517 ","Keywords":"Depressive Disorder/psychology/*therapy\r\nHumans\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Blacker D (1996) Maintenance treatment of major depression: a review of the literature..

Suicide risk was 24 times as high during periods off compared with periods on adequate lithium prophylaxis. Incidence of attempting suicide was similar during the periods before receiving or after discontinuing lithium treatment, whereas it was 5 to 6 times lower during prophylaxis.

We compare several treatment options for SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) non-responders and test the feasibility of the algorithm in clinical conditions. METHODS: Patients with severe depressive disorders (ICD-10; MADRS > or = 25) admitted to an academic outpatient clinic were enrolled in this algorithm-guided sequential treatment protocol (starting with an SSRI and ending with a tricyclic, lithium, triodothyronine combination). The general principle of the algorithm was to boost the drug therapy in the event of non-response. RESULTS: 135 patients entered the study and 131 were eligible for analysis. From this group, 86 patients dropped out (65.6%), 40 reached complete remission (30.5%) and 5 patients did not reach remission at all (3.8%). In the 117 patients to whom a last observation carried forward approach was applied, the median improvement of the MADRS score was 48.0% (range -20.7%-100%), with 48.7% of patients considered responders, 23.1% partial responders and 28.2% non-responders. Median retention time was 8 weeks (range 2-34). CONCLUSIONS: This algorithm-guided antidepressant treatment was acceptable for clinicians and resulted in an elevated final response rate among study completers. However, the dropout rate was high, mainly due to treatment interruption or non-observance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bondolfi G ; Aubry JM ; Golaz J ; Gex-Fabry M ; Gervasoni N ; Bertschy G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4414/smw.2006.11267 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*Algorithms\r\nClinical Protocols\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nRemission Induction\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use\r\nSwitzerland","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bondolfi G, Aubry JM, Golaz J, Gex-Fabry M, Gervasoni N, and Bertschy G (2006) A stepwise drug treatment algorithm to obtain complete remission in depression: a Geneva study..

Lithium also reduced the hypoactivity observed 1--3 h after reserpine (0.75 mg/kg, i.p.). In biochemical studies we found that 8-day treatment with lithium markedly reduced (to 45% of control) the recovery from brain of labelled 2-phenylethylamine (PEA) following i.p. injection of labelled L-phenylalanine, while decreasing recovery from brain of labelled PEA following its i.p. injection of 63% of control. In saline-treated mice, d-amphetamine appeared to increase PEA synthesis and to accelerate its disposition, whereas reserpine enhanced PEA synthesis and reduced disposition; all of these effects were antagonized by lithium pretreatments. Since PEA appears to be one of the most powerful behavioral stimulants among endogenous neuroamines, and because its deaminated metabolites are behavioral depressants, such antagonism of brain PEA metabolism may significantly contribute to the prophylactic action of lithium against both manic and depressive behavior.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Borison RL ; Sabelli HC ; Maple PJ ; Havdala HS ; Diamond BI ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/BF00426631 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrain/drug effects/metabolism\r\nDextroamphetamine/*antagonists & inhibitors\r\nLithium/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/*drug effects\r\nPhenethylamines/*metabolism/physiology\r\nReserpine/*antagonists & inhibitors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Borison RL, Sabelli HC, Maple PJ, Havdala HS, and Diamond BI (1978) Lithium prevention of amphetamine-induced 'manic' excitement and of reserpine-induced 'depression' in mice: possible role of 2-phenylethylamine..

Eligible trials were randomized double-blind trials comparing lithium with placebo in patients with mood disorders who were not already on lithium before randomization in order to avoid withdrawal effects in the placebo group. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Two researchers extracted data independently. Data were analysed with Review Manager 5.3 (Peto odds ratio). RESULTS: We found 45 eligible studies. Only four studies reported any suicides or other deaths in the lithium or placebo group. There was a significant reduction in total mortality (two versus nine), odds ratio 0.28 (95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.93). There was no statistically significant reduction in suicides, (none versus three), odds ratio 0.13 (0.01 to 1.27).

The impact of mood stabilizers on reducing the risk of switching was analyzed using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Maniform switches during inpatient treatment were observed in 39 (25%) patients out of the total of 158 patients. Results indicate that especially patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants are at risk of switching to maniform states. This risk was shown to be significantly less when patients also received a mood stabilising medication (lithium, carbamazepine or valproic acid).

Several studies have shown its usefulness in neurological and psychiatric diseases. Furthermore, it seems that magnesium levels are lowered in the course of several mental disorders, especially depression. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we wish to evaluate the presence of a relationship between the levels of magnesium and the presence of psychiatric pathology as well as the effectiveness of magnesium as a therapeutic supplementation. METHODS: A systematic search of scientific records concerning magnesium in psychiatric disorders published from 2010 up to March 2020 was performed. We collected a total of 32 articles: 18 on Depressive Disorders (DD), four on Anxiety Disorders (AD), four on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), three on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), one on Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), one on Schizophrenia (SCZ) and one on Eating Disorders (ED). RESULTS: Twelve studies highlighted mainly positive results in depressive symptoms. Seven showed a significant correlation between reduced plasma magnesium values and depression measured with psychometric scales. Two papers reported improved depressive symptoms after magnesium intake, two in association with antidepressants, compared to controls. No significant association between magnesium serum levels and panic or Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) patients, in two distinct papers, was found. In two other papers, a reduced Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) score in depressed patients correlated with higher levels of magnesium and beneficial levels of magnesium in stressed patients was found. Two papers reported low levels of magnesium in association with ADHD. Only one of three papers showed lower levels of magnesium in ASD. ED and SCZ reported a variation in magnesium levels in some aspects of the disease. CONCLUSION: The results are not univocal, both in terms of the plasma levels and of therapeutic effects. However, from the available evidence, it emerged that supplementation with magnesium could be beneficial. Therefore, it is necessary to design ad hoc clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of magnesium alone or together with other drugs (antidepressants) in order to establish the correct use of this cation with potential therapeutic effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Botturi A ; Ciappolino V ; Delvecchio G ; Boscutti A ; Viscardi B ; Brambilla P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu12061661 ","Keywords":"Biomarkers/blood\r\nDepression/blood/diagnosis/therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMagnesium/*administration & dosage/blood/physiology\r\nMale\r\nMental Disorders/blood/diagnosis/prevention & control/*therapy\r\nObsessive-compulsive Disorder\r\nanxiety disorder\r\nautism\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ndepression\r\neating disorder\r\nmagnesium\r\nmental disorders\r\nschizophrenia","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Botturi A, Ciappolino V, Delvecchio G, Boscutti A, Viscardi B, and Brambilla P (2020) The Role and the Effect of Magnesium in Mental Disorders: A Systematic Review..

Thus, exploring the utility of mood stabilisers as monotherapy for bipolar depression is important.

However, the percentage of patients persistently benefited is low, because it has both low efficacy in many symptomatic and illness course presentations of the disorder and low tolerability. Converging evidence from clinical and animal studies indicates that a principal behavioral effect of lithium is reduction of motor activity.

This study compared the efficacy of divalproex, lithium, and placebo as prophylactic therapy. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group multicenter study of treatment outcomes was conducted over a 52-week maintenance period. Patients who met the recovery criteria within 3 months of the onset of an index manic episode (n = 372) were randomized to maintenance treatment with divalproex, lithium, or placebo in a 2:1:1 ratio. Psychotropic medications were discontinued before randomization, except for open-label divalproex or lithium, which were gradually tapered over the first 2 weeks of maintenance treatment. The primary outcome measure was time to recurrence of any mood episode. Secondary measures were time to a manic episode, time to a depressive episode, average change from baseline in Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Change Version subscale scores for depression and mania, and Global Assessment of Function scores. RESULTS: The divalproex group did not differ significantly from the placebo group in time to any mood episode. Divalproex was superior to placebo in terms of lower rates of discontinuation for either a recurrent mood episode or depressive episode. Divalproex was superior to lithium in longer duration of successful prophylaxis in the study and less deterioration in depressive symptoms and Global Assessment Scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: The treatments did not differ significantly on time to recurrence of any mood episode during maintenance therapy. Patients treated with divalproex had better outcomes than those treated with placebo or lithium on several secondary outcome measures.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bowden CL ; Calabrese JR ; McElroy SL ; Gyulai L ; Wassef A ; Petty F ; Pope HG Jr; Chou JC ; Keck PE Jr; Rhodes LJ ; Swann AC ; Hirschfeld RM ; Wozniak PJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1001/archpsyc.57.5.481 ","Keywords":"*Ambulatory Care\r\nAntimanic Agents/adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/*prevention & control/psychology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nPlacebos\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales/statistics & numerical data\r\nSecondary Prevention\r\nStatistics, Nonparametric\r\nSurvival Analysis\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nValproic Acid/adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bowden CL, Calabrese JR, McElroy SL, Gyulai L, Wassef A, Petty F, Pope HG Jr, Chou JC, Keck PE Jr, Rhodes LJ, Swann AC, Hirschfeld RM, and Wozniak PJ (2000) A randomized, placebo-controlled 12-month trial of divalproex and lithium in treatment of outpatients with bipolar I disorder.

Lithium is effective acutely in patients with pure or elated mania, and in its prophylaxis, but may worsen depressive symptoms in such patients when used for long-term maintenance therapy. The nature of previous responses to lithium treatment predicts the type of response that can be expected during a further episode of the disorder. Mixed mania, secondary mania, and mania associated with substance abuse--as well as rapid cycling --generally respond poorly to lithium therapy. Divalproex sodium has a broader spectrum of efficacy and fewer factors that determine differential responsiveness. Data related to treatment with carbamazepine are sparse, but patients with rapid cycling may respond less well to this agent; on the other hand, limited data support the utility of carbamazepine in bipolar patients with extreme psychosis, including those with mood-incongruent features. Both classical and atypical neuroleptics (e.g. olanzapine) could profitably be used in acute mania and mixed states. Lamotrigine has recently been shown effective in bipolar depression and rapid cycling. Patients unresponsive to a single agent may show improvement with combined regimens, though this impression is based more on clinical experience than controlled randomized assignment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bowden CL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0165-0327(98)00160-8 ","Keywords":"Affect/drug effects\r\nAntimanic Agents/*pharmacology\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/pharmacology\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nCarbamazepine/pharmacology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*pharmacology\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nValproic Acid/pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bowden CL (2001) Clinical correlates of therapeutic response in bipolar disorder..

We examined the impact of initial euphoric or dysphoric manic symptomatology on maintenance outcome. Randomized maintenance treatment with divalproex, lithium, or placebo was provided for 372 bipolar I patients, who met improvement criteria during open phase treatment for an index manic episode. The current analysis grouped patients according to the index manic episode subtype (euphoric or dysphoric), and evaluated the impact on maintenance treatment outcome. The rate of early discontinuation due to intolerance during maintenance treatment was higher for initially dysphoric patients (N=249) than euphoric patients (N=123; 15.7 vs 7.3%, respectively; p=0.032). Both lithium (23.2%) and divalproex (17.1%) were associated with more premature discontinuations due to intolerance than placebo (4.8%; p=0.003 and 0.02, respectively) in the initially dysphoric patients. Among initially euphoric patients, treatment with lithium was associated with significantly more premature discontinuations due to intolerance compared to placebo (18.2 vs 0%; p=0.03), and divalproex was significantly (p=0.05) more effective than lithium, but not placebo in delaying time to a depressive episode. Initial euphoric mania appeared to predispose to better outcomes on indices of depression and overall function with divalproex maintenance than with either placebo or lithium. Dysphoric mania appeared to predispose patients to more side effects when treated with either divalproex or lithium during maintenance therapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bowden CL ; Collins MA ; McElroy SL ; Calabrese JR ; Swann AC ; Weisler RH ; Wozniak PJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/sj.npp.1300788 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/classification/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Evaluation/methods\r\nDrug Tolerance\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nTime Factors\r\nValproic Acid/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bowden CL, Collins MA, McElroy SL, Calabrese JR, Swann AC, Weisler RH, and Wozniak PJ (2005) Relationship of mania symptomatology to maintenance treatment response with divalproex, lithium, or placebo..

Lithium could potentially lower these risks, but is used only in a minority of patients.AimsThis study quantifies the effect of lithium on risk of suicide and readmission and identifies factors that are associate with readmission and suicide. METHOD: This population-based register study used data from the Swedish National Quality Register for ECT and other Swedish national registers. Patients who have received ECT for unipolar depression as in-patients between 2011 and 2016 were followed until death, readmission to hospital or the termination of the study at the end of 2016. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of readmission and suicide in adjusted models. RESULTS: Out of 7350 patients, 56 died by suicide and 4203 were readmitted. Lithium was prescribed to 638 (9%) patients. Mean follow-up was 1.4 years. Lithium was significantly associated with lower risk of suicide (P = 0.014) and readmission (HR 0.84 95% CI 0.75-0.93). The number needed to be treated with lithium to prevent one readmission was 16. In addition, the following factors were statistically associated with suicide: male gender, being a widow, substance use disorder and a history of suicide attempts. Readmission was associated with young age, being divorced or unemployed, comorbid anxiety disorder, nonpsychotic depression, more severe symptoms before ECT, no improvement with ECT, not receiving continuation ECT or antidepressants, usage of antipsychotics, anxiolytics or benzodiazepines, severity of medication resistance and number of previous admissions.

Disturbances of mood are the most common psychiatric disorders in adults, with 18-23% of women and 8-11% of men having at least one major depressive episode. Genetic factors are important in both depression and manic-depressive illness. Depression is characterized by a persistent dysphoric mood accompanied by feelings of sadness or hopelessness nearly every day for at least two weeks. The essential feature of a manic episode is an elevated, expansive, or irritable mood associated with symptoms such as hyperactivity and lack of judgment. Treatment involves nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions. Psychotherapy in patients with depression is most useful in improving social functions, while antidepressant drugs reduce relapse rates. Electroconvulsive therapy is indicated in depressed patients at immediate risk of suicide or extreme incapacitation. Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, imipramine, doxepin, notriptyline, desipramine, trimipramine), second-generation antidepressants (maprotiline, amoxapine, trazodone, bupropion), monoamine-oxidase inhibitors (phenelzine, isocarboxazid, tranylcypromine, pargyline), and lithium are useful in treating patients with affective disorders. Tricyclic agents are the mainstay of treatment for depression; newer second-generation agents should be used in specific subgroups of patients. Lithium is the drug of choice for prophylaxis in bipolar patients, whereas combinations of lithium and tricyclic agents are useful during acute episodes of depression in bipolar patients. Major affective disorders occur commonly and require a careful balance of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for proper therapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bryant SG ; Brown CS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use\r\nBiogenic Amines/physiology\r\nDiagnosis, Differential\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nMood Disorders/classification/diagnosis/*drug \r\n      therapy/epidemiology/physiopathology/therapy\r\nPsychotherapy\r\nReceptors, Serotonin/physiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bryant SG, and Brown CS (1986) Current concepts in clinical therapeutics: major affective disorders, Part 1..

The exact mode of its action is unknown, but an enhancement of serotonergic transmission is hypothesized. The authors investigated changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system during lithium augmentation and their correlation to clinical response by means of the combined dexamethasone/CRH test (DEX/CRH test). Thirty patients with unipolar major depressive episodes (DSM IV) who had not responded to an adequate trial with an antidepressant were assessed on the day before lithium augmentation (baseline) with the DEX/CRH test (pretreatment with 1.5 mg dexamethasone p.o. at 11 P.M. and CRH stimulation at 3 P.M. on the next day). Twenty-four patients were re-assessed after response was determined or, in cases of non-response, four weeks after initiation of lithium augmentation. Response to lithium augmentation was measured by weekly ratings on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS 17-item version). Response was defined as a DeltaHDRS of > or =50% and an endpoint score of < 10. Patients had a significantly higher ACTH and cortisol response to CRH stimulation during lithium augmentation compared with the values at baseline. There was no difference in ACTH and cortisol reaction between responders and non-responders to lithium augmentation. This increase is in contrast to the known normalization of HPA-axis overdrive after treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant like amitriptyline. Because the effect was independent of response status we suggest that this increase reflects an effect of lithium that is independent from the psychopathological state or its change. This effect might be explained by the serotonergic effects of lithium.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bschor T ; Adli M ; Baethge C ; Eichmann U ; Ising M ; Uhr M ; Modell S ; Künzel H ; Müller-Oerlinghausen B ; Bauer M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/S0893-133X(02)00323-8 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdrenocorticotropic Hormone/*blood\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nCorticotropin-Releasing Hormone/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/blood/*drug therapy\r\nDexamethasone/*therapeutic use\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nGlucocorticoids/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nHydrocortisone/*blood\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/drug effects/physiopathology\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMatched-Pair Analysis\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nStatistics, Nonparametric\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bschor T, Adli M, Baethge C, Eichmann U, Ising M, Uhr M, Modell S, Künzel H, Müller-Oerlinghausen B, and Bauer M (2002) Lithium augmentation increases the ACTH and cortisol response in the combined DEX/CRH test in unipolar major depression..

This article reviews the clinical evidence and hypotheses on the mode of action of lithium augmentation. For this purpose, studies were identified by searching Medline and by scanning the references of published reviews and standard textbooks. With regard to efficacy, 28 prospective studies (with a total of 838 depressed patients) were identified. The majority of randomized controlled trials has demonstrated substantial efficacy of lithium augmentation. A recent meta-analysis including only double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (N = 9) provided firm evidence that lithium augmentation has a statistically significant effect on response rate compared to placebo, and showed that lithium augmentation should be administered for at least 2 weeks to allow assessment of the patient's response. A recent double-blind, placebo-controlled trial revealed that responders to lithium augmentation should be maintained on the lithium-antidepressant combination for a minimum of 12 months. From animal studies there is robust evidence that lithium augmentation increases serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission, possibly through a synergistic action of lithium and the antidepressant on brain 5-HT pathways. Neuroendocrine studies in humans on the effects of lithium augmentation on the HPA system showed an unexpected and marked increase in the ACTH and cortisol response in the combined dexamethasone/CRH test. These results are in contrast to the established decline of HPA system activity during treatment with antidepressants. In conclusion, lithium is the foremost and most well-documented augmentation strategy in refractory depression.

Lithium is central to the treatment of affective disorders, but little is known about its effects on the HPA system of depressed subjects. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of lithium monotherapy on the HPA system of patients with major depression by means of the combined DEX/CRH test. METHOD: Thirty drug-naive outpatients with major depression (single episode or unipolar recurrent; SCID I- and II-confirmed) were treated with lithium monotherapy for four weeks. The DEX/CRH test was conducted directly before intake of the first lithium tablet and four weeks thereafter. Weekly ratings with the HDRS(21) were used to determine response (≥50% symptom reduction) and remission (HDRS ≤7). RESULTS: Lithium levels within the therapeutic range were achieved rapidly. Tolerability was good; no patient terminated the treatment prematurely. Response and remission rates were 50% and 33% respectively. Compared to the DEX/CRH test before the start of the treatment, a considerable and significant increase in all CRH-stimulated ACTH and cortisol parameters could be detected in the second DEX/CRH test. When analysed with particular regard to responders and non-responders, that significant increase was only present in the responders. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to demonstrate that lithium leads to a significant activation of the HPA system. This is possibly connected to stimulation of hypothalamic arginine vasoporessin (AVP), to direct intracellular effects of lithium on pituitary cells and to an induction of gene expression.

Results were compared with citalopram's efficacy as shown in a different but methodologically identical study (including same researchers, same time, and same place).Thirty patients with an acute MDD (Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition [DSM IV] I) were treated with lithium monotherapy (study 1) or with citalopram monotherapy (study 2, N = 32) for 4 weeks.Response rates (decrease in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score >50%) were 50% for lithium and 72% for citalopram (P = 0.12). Citalopram-treated subjects showed a greater decrease in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores (significant at 2 weeks). In the lithium study, only patients with a recurrent episode (DSM-IV: 296.3) responded (15/22), as opposed to none of 8 patients with a first/single episode (DSM-IV: 296.2) (P = 0.002). Patients with a single episode responded significantly more often to citalopram than to lithium (P = 0.007). Both drugs were well tolerated. Only one patient (citalopram) terminated the study prematurely owing to adverse effects.Our results do not support the use of lithium as an alternative to SSRI in the treatment of acute MDD. The finding of a better response to lithium in patients with a recurrent depression has not been reported before and warrants replication.

They carry a high risk of suicide. Maintenance treatment, aimed at the prevention of relapse, is therefore of vital importance. Lithium has been used for some years as the mainstay of maintenance treatment in bipolar affective disorder, and to a lesser extent in unipolar disorder. However, the efficacy and effectiveness of prophylactic lithium therapy has been disputed. Low suicide rates in lithium-treated patients have led to claims that lithium has a specific anti-suicidal effect. If so, this is of considerable importance as treatments for mental disorders in general have not been shown convincingly to be effective in suicide prevention. OBJECTIVES: 1. To investigate the efficacy of lithium treatment in the prevention of relapse in recurrent mood disorders. 2. To examine the effect of lithium treatment on consumers' general health and social functioning, its acceptability to consumers, and the side-effects of treatment. 3. To investigate the hypothesis that lithium has a specific effect in reducing the incidence of suicide and deliberate self-harm in persons with mood disorders. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) and The Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register (CCTR) were searched. Reference lists of relevant papers and major text books of mood disorder were examined. Authors, other experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies were contacted for knowledge of suitable trials, published or unpublished. Specialist journals concerning lithium were hand searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing lithium with placebo, where the stated intent of treatment was maintenance or prophylaxis. Participants were males and females of all ages with diagnoses of mood disorder. Discontinuation studies (in which all participants had been stable on lithium for some time before being randomised to either continued lithium treatment or placebo substitution) were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted from the original reports independently by two reviewers. The main outcomes studied were related to the objectives stated above. Data were analysed for all diagnoses of mood disorder and for bipolar and unipolar disorder separately. Data were analysed using Review Manager version 4.0. MAIN RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the review, reporting on 825 participants randomly allocated to lithium or placebo. Lithium was found to be more effective than placebo in preventing relapse in mood disorder overall, and in bipolar disorder. The most consistent effect was found in bipolar disorder (random effects OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.93 ). In unipolar disorder, the direction of effect was in favour of lithium, but the result (when heterogeneity between studies was allowed for) did not reach statistical significance. Considerable heterogeneity was found between studies in all groups of patients. The direction of effect was the same in all studies; no study found a negative effect for lithium. Heterogeneity may have been due to differences in selection of participants, and to differing exposures to lithium in the pre-study phase resulting in variable influence of a discontinuation effect. There was little reported data on overall health and social functioning of participants under the different treatment conditions, or on the participants' own views of their treatment. Descriptive analysis showed that assessments of general health and social functioning generally favoured lithium. Small absolute numbers of deaths and suicides, and the absence of data on non-fatal suicidal behaviours, made it impossible to draw meaningful conclusions about the place of lithium therapy in suicide prevention. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review indicates that lithium is an efficacious maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder. In unipolar disorder the evidence of efficacy is less robust. This review does not cover the relative efficacy of lithium compared with other maintenance treatments, which is at present unclear. There is no definitive evidence from this review as to whether or not lithium has an anti-suicidal effect.

Nevertheless, it is rarely used in geriatric patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate treatment response of LA in geriatric compared to non-geriatric patients. METHOD: In a prospective multicenter cohort study, severity of depression was measured weekly in 167 patients with unipolar depression (n(age≥65years) = 22; n(age<65years) = 145) at baseline and over at least four weeks of LA. RESULTS: Geriatric patients showed a significantly better response to LA compared to non-geriatric patients (Hazard Ratio = 1.91; p = 0.04). LIMITATIONS: An important limitation of our study is the lack of a control group of LA and the missing evaluation of side effects in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study investigating the efficacy of LA for TRD in geriatric compared to non-geriatric patients. Our data suggest that LA is an effective treatment option in geriatric patients that clinicians might consider more frequently and earlier on in the course of treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Buspavanich P ; Behr J ; Stamm T ; Schlattmann P ; Bschor T ; Richter C ; Hellweg R ; Heinz A ; Berger M ; Hindinger C ; Rentzsch J ; de Millas W ; Jockers-Scherübl MC ; Bräunig P ; Adli M ; Ricken R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2019.03.057 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nCohort Studies\r\nDepression\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nProspective Studies\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nEfficacy\r\nGeriatric patients\r\nLithium augmentation\r\nTreatment-resistant depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Buspavanich P, Behr J, Stamm T, Schlattmann P, Bschor T, Richter C, Hellweg R, Heinz A, Berger M, Hindinger C, Rentzsch J, de Millas W, Jockers-Scherübl MC, Bräunig P, Adli M, and Ricken R (2019) Treatment response of lithium augmentation in geriatric compared to non-geriatric patients with treatment-resistant depression..

DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE® and PsycINFO®, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Ovid Embase® bibliographic databases; hand searches of references of relevant systematic reviews through May 2017. REVIEW METHODS: Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials and prospective cohorts with comparator arms enrolling adults with bipolar disorder (BD) of any type with 3 weeks followup for acute mania, 3 months for depression, and 6 months for maintenance treatments. We excluded acute mania and depression studies with greater than 50 percent attrition. RESULTS: We synthesized evidence from 157 unique studies, 108 studies for 28 drugs, 49 studies for nondrug interventions. All drug study findings with at least low-strength evidence were based almost exclusively on adults with bipolar I disorder (BD-I). Asenapine, cariprazine, quetiapine, and olanzapine improved acute mania symptoms compared to placebo (low-strength evidence). However, improvements were of modest clinical significance, with values that were less than the minimally important difference, but still large enough that a reasonable proportion of participants likely received a benefit. Unpooled evidence indicated an overall beneficial effect of risperidone and ziprasidone on acute mania symptoms compared to placebo (low-strength evidence). Participants using atypical antipsychotics, except quetiapine, reported more extrapyramidal symptoms compared to placebo, and those using olanzapine reported more clinically significant weight gain. Lithium improved acute mania in the short term and prolonged time to relapse in the long term compared to placebo (low-strength evidence). No difference was found between olanzapine and divalproex/valproate for acute mania (low-strength evidence). For drugs not approved for BD, paliperidone improved acute mania compared to placebo (low-strength evidence), while topiramate and allopurinol showed no benefit (low-strength evidence). Further, lithium improved acute mania better than topiramate (low-strength evidence), although withdrawals for adverse events were lower for topiramate. Only lithium reached a minimally important difference for acute mania and maintenance treatment. All other drug comparisons to placebo or active controls for acute mania, depression, and maintenance had insufficient evidence. For psychosocial interventions, cognitive behavioral training (CBT) was no better for depression or mania symptoms than psychoeducation or other active psychosocial comparators (low-strength evidence). Systematic/collaborative care had no effect on relapse compared to inactive comparators (low-strength evidence). CONCLUSIONS: We found no high- or moderate-strength evidence for any intervention to effectively treat any phase of any type of BD versus placebo or an active comparator. All antipsychotics approved by the Food and Drug Administration, except aripiprazole, had low-strength evidence for benefit for acute mania in adults with BD-I. Lithium improved short-term for acute mania and resulted in longer time to relapse in the long term versus placebo in adults with BD-I. Aside from low-strength evidence showing CBT and systematic/collaborative care having no benefit for a few outcomes, evidence was insufficient for nondrug interventions. Information on harms was limited across all studies. Future research examining BD treatments will require innovative ways to increase study completion rates.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Book, Whole","Authors":"Butler M ; Urosevic S ; Desai P ; Sponheim SR ; Popp J ; Nelson VA ; Thao V ; Sunderlin B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Butler M, Urosevic S, Desai P, Sponheim SR, Popp J, Nelson VA, Thao V, and Sunderlin B (2018) Treatment for Bipolar Disorder in Adults: A Systematic Review.

Antidepressant drug substitution should generally be reserved for use in patients who haven't responded at all (nonresponders). Combining two or more antidepressants is generally not recommended, as this approach may obscure adequate monotherapy evaluation and lead to significant adverse effects or drug-drug interactions. Use of electroconvulsive therapy is recommended in patients with psychotic and severe refractory depression.

METHOD: A 20-month, double-blind, parallel-group comparison was carried out in recently hypomanic/manic patients who had experienced a persistent bimodal response to combined treatment with lithium and divalproex. Sixty patients were randomly assigned to lithium or divalproex monotherapy in a balanced design after stratification for illness type (bipolar I versus bipolar II disorder). RESULTS: Of the 254 patients enrolled in the open-label acute stabilization phase, 76% discontinued the study prematurely (poor adherence: 28%; nonresponse: 26% [of whom 74% remained depressed and 26% remained in a hypomanic/manic/mixed episode], intolerable side effects: 19%). Of the 60 patients (24%) randomly assigned to double-blind maintenance monotherapy, 53% relapsed (59% into depression and 41% into a hypomanic/manic/mixed episode), 22% completed the study, 10% had intolerable side effects, and 10% were poorly adherent. The rates of relapse into any mood episode for those given lithium versus divalproex were 56% and 50%, respectively; the rates were 34% and 29% for a depressive relapse and 19% and 22% for a hypomania/mania relapse. There were no significant differences in time to relapse. The proportion discontinuing prematurely because of side effects was 16% for lithium and 4% for divalproex. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that divalproex is more effective than lithium in the long-term management of rapid-cycling bipolar disorder is not supported by these data.

To evaluate the recurrence prevention efficacy of lurasidone for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, patients received up to 20 weeks of open-label lurasidone (20-80mg/d) combined with lithium or valproate during an initial stabilization phase. A total of 496 patients met stabilization criteria and were randomized to 28 weeks of double-blind treatment with lurasidone (20-80mg/d) or placebo, in combination with lithium or valproate. Based on a Cox proportional hazard model, treatment with lurasidone reduced the probability of recurrence of any mood episode by 29% (primary endpoint), however, the reduction did not achieve statistical significance. Probability of recurrence on lurasidone was significantly lower in patients with an index episode of depression (HR, 0.57; P=0.039), in patients with any index episode who were not rapid-cycling (HR, 0.69; P=0.046), and when recurrence was based on MADRS, YMRS, or CGI-BP-S severity criteria (HR, 0.53; P=0.025; sensitivity analysis). Long-term treatment with lurasidone combined with lithium or valproate was found to be safe and well-tolerated, with minimal effects on weight or metabolic parameters.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Calabrese JR ; Pikalov A ; Streicher C ; Cucchiaro J ; Mao Y ; Loebel A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.euroneuro.2017.06.013 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDisease-Free Survival\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nKaplan-Meier Estimate\r\nLithium Compounds/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nLurasidone Hydrochloride/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nRecurrence\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nValproic Acid/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAtypical antipsychotic\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nLurasidone\r\nRecurrence","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Calabrese JR, Pikalov A, Streicher C, Cucchiaro J, Mao Y, and Loebel A (2017) Lurasidone in combination with lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder..

The primary aim of this study was to compare treatment outcomes of bipolar depressed individuals with and without psychosis. The secondary aim was to compare the effect of lithium and quetiapine, each with adjunctive personalized treatments (APTs), in the psychotic subgroup. METHODS: We assessed participants with DSM-IV bipolar depression included in a comparative effectiveness study of lithium and quetiapine with APTs (the Bipolar CHOICE study). Severity was assessed by the Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale (BISS) and by the Clinical Global Impression Scale-Severity-Bipolar Version (CGI-S-BP). Mixed models were used to assess the course of symptom change, and Cox regression survival analysis was used to assess the time to remission. RESULTS: Psychotic features were present in 10.6% (n = 32) of the depressed participants (n = 303). Those with psychotic features had higher scores on the BISS before (75.2 ± 17.6 vs. 54.9 ± 16.3; P < .001) and after (37.2 ± 19.7 vs. 26.3 ± 18.0; P = .003) 6-month treatment. The CGI-S-BP yielded similar results. Participants with and without psychosis had similar course of symptom improvement and similar time to remission. There was no significant difference in the treatment outcomes of lithium (n = 11) and quetiapine (n = 21) among the psychotic subgroup. CONCLUSION: Bipolar depressive episodes with psychotic features are more severe, and compared to nonpsychotic depressions, present a similar course of improvement. Given the small number of participants presenting psychosis, the lack of statistically significant difference between lithium- and quetiapine-based treatment of psychotic bipolar depressive episodes needs replication in a larger sample.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Caldieraro MA ; Dufour S ; Sylvia LG ; Gao K ; Ketter TA ; Bobo WV ; Walsh S ; Janos J ; Tohen M ; Reilly-Harrington NA ; McElroy SL ; Shelton RC ; Bowden CL ; Deckersbach T ; Nierenberg AA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/da.22716 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/*pharmacology\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*pharmacology\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/epidemiology/physiopathology\r\nComorbidity\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Psychotic Disorders/drug therapy/epidemiology/physiopathology\r\nQuetiapine Fumarate/*pharmacology\r\n*Treatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult\r\nbipolar depression\r\nbipolar disorder\r\npsychosis\r\npsychotic mood disorders\r\ntreatment outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Caldieraro MA, Dufour S, Sylvia LG, Gao K, Ketter TA, Bobo WV, Walsh S, Janos J, Tohen M, Reilly-Harrington NA, McElroy SL, Shelton RC, Bowden CL, Deckersbach T, and Nierenberg AA (2018) Treatment outcomes of acute bipolar depressive episode with psychosis..

In the present review, we identify the available literature regarding the pharmacological augmentation to AD in TRD. Research in the main psychiatric databases was performed (PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, PsychInfo). Only original articles in English with the main topic being pharmacological augmentation in TRD and presenting a precise definition of TRD were included. Aripiprazole and lithium were the most investigated molecules, and aripiprazole presented the strongest evidence of efficacy. Moreover, olanzapine, quetiapine, cariprazine, risperidone, and ziprasidone showed positive results but to a lesser extent. Brexpiprazole and intranasal esketamine need further study in real-world practice. Intravenous ketamine presented an evincible AD effect in the short-term. The efficacy of adjunctive ADs, antiepileptic drugs, psychostimulants, pramipexole, ropinirole, acetyl-salicylic acid, metyrapone, reserpine, testosterone, T3/T4, naltrexone, SAMe, and zinc cannot be precisely estimated in light of the limited available data. Studies on lamotrigine and pindolol reported negative results. According to our results, aripiprazole and lithium may be considered by clinicians as potential effective augmentative strategies in TRD, although the data regarding lithium are somewhat controversial. Reliable conclusions about the other molecules cannot be drawn. Further controlled comparative studies, standardized in terms of design, doses, and duration of the augmentative treatments, are needed to formulate definitive conclusions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Caldiroli A ; Capuzzi E ; Tagliabue I ; Capellazzi M ; Marcatili M ; Mucci F ; Colmegna F ; Clerici M ; Buoli M ; Dakanalis A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ijms222313070 ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/therapeutic use\r\nBuspirone/therapeutic use\r\nCentral Nervous System Stimulants/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nHumans\r\nKetamine/therapeutic use\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\naugmentation\r\npsychopharmacology\r\nreview\r\ntreatment-resistant depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Caldiroli A, Capuzzi E, Tagliabue I, Capellazzi M, Marcatili M, Mucci F, Colmegna F, Clerici M, Buoli M, and Dakanalis A (2021) Augmentative Pharmacological Strategies in Treatment-Resistant Major Depression: A Comprehensive Review..

The main comparator treatments in the pivotal trials were lithium and .no maintenance. (acute-only) treatment. A comparison with olanzapine was included as an indirect analysis following publication of data during the course of our research. METHODS: A Markov model was built around the 3 health states of euthymia, mania, and depression. The base-case model simulates a cohort of 1,000 patients with BD-I who have recently stabilized after resolution of a bipolar mania episode. The cohort was modeled for a period of 18 months. Resource-use estimates were derived from best available published data, treatment guidelines, a physician survey, and published unit cost data. Outputs were measured in terms of costs per acute mood episode avoided, costs per euthymic day gained, and costs per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Direct health care payer costs are used in the analyses. RESULTS: The base-case model for patients with a recent manic episode indicated that lamotrigine is the most effective treatment for avoiding both acute depression episodes and all types of acute episodes (depression and mania). It is also the most effective treatment in terms of number of euthymic days achieved (309 days per patient per year). Olanzapine is most effective for avoiding acute mania episodes. Total direct costs of treatment are lowest for the lithium treatment arm (Dollars 8,710 per patient for the 18-month period). All maintenance therapies were cost effective compared with the no-maintenance (acute-only treatment) arm. In the base case, lamotrigine had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of Dollars 30 per euthymic day and Dollars 2,400 per acute episode avoided compared with lithium. A QALY analysis indicated that lamotrigine is cost effective in patients with a recent manic episode at Dollars 26,000 per QALY. The base-case model indicated that lamotrigine dominates olanzapine, (that is, lamotrigine costs less and is more effective than olanzapine) in patients with a recent manic episode. In a sensitivity analysis using outcomes from the pivotal trial of recently depressed patients, lamotrigine, in comparison with lithium, was not shown to be as cost effective as in the recently manic patients, but it was still cost effective compared with no maintenance treatment. CONCLUSIONS: For a defined cohort of patients with BD-I, the pharmacoeconomic model indicated that prevention of mood episodes with lithium and lamotrigine is cost effective in patients with a recent manic, mixed, or hypomanic episode. The conclusions with respect to the indirect comparison with olanzapine should be validated if and when direct trial data become available. Cost-effectiveness of maintenance treatments for patients with BD-I (recently depressed as well as recently manic) are likely to improve in models with a broader costing perspective and that take a longer time frame. Further research into the outcome implications of health-related quality of life and other BD subgroups are recommended.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Calvert NW ; Burch SP ; Fu AZ ; Reeves P ; Thompson TR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.18553/jmcp.2006.12.4.322 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*economics/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/*economics/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/economics/therapeutic use\r\nBenzodiazepines/economics/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*economics\r\nCost-Benefit Analysis\r\nHumans\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLithium Compounds/economics/therapeutic use\r\nModels, Economic\r\nOlanzapine\r\nQuality-Adjusted Life Years\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTriazines/*economics/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Calvert NW, Burch SP, Fu AZ, Reeves P, and Thompson TR (2006) The cost-effectiveness of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of adults with bipolar I disorder..

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is defined by impaired attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, whereas ASD is defined by social dysfunction, communicative impairment, and restricted/repetitive behaviors. They should be distinctly evaluated in children and adolescents with ASD and intellectual disability in contrast to individuals without intellectual disability, because significant differences between these conditions exist. Mood disorders are also common in ASD and should be systematically investigated in this population of children and adolescents. Approximately 50% of children and adolescents with ASD receive medication for comorbid behavioral/ADHD and mood symptoms, mostly stimulants, antiepileptics and antipsychotics. Guidelines for the evaluation and treatment including medications for ADHD-like symptoms have recently been provided and should be carefully considered. Antiepileptic drugs are commonly used in ASDs with epilepsy, because seizures are associated with ASD in 10% to 30% of young patients, and as mood stabilizers. Lithium is another option for children and adolescents with ASD who present with symptoms of a mood disorder, such as elevated moods/euphoria, mania, and paranoia, whether accompanied or not by irritability. Experimental treatments are under investigation and currently include arbaclofen, a γ-aminobutyric acid agent, and N-acetylcisteine, a glutamate agent.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Canitano R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/WNF.0000000000000096 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/therapeutic use\r\nAdolescent\r\nAnticonvulsants/therapeutic use\r\nAutism Spectrum Disorder/*complications/*drug therapy\r\nBaclofen/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use\r\nBumetanide/therapeutic use\r\nChild\r\nDiuretics/therapeutic use\r\nFree Radical Scavengers/therapeutic use\r\nGABA-B Receptor Agonists/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nMood Disorders/*complications/*drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Canitano R (2015) Mood Stabilizers in Children and Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorders..

However, response latency to lithium augmentation is extremely variable, suggesting other mechanisms may be involved. To evaluate whether long-term tricyclic treatment is necessary for lithium augmentation's effect, the rapidity and magnitude of response to lithium combined with desipramine from the start of treatment was compared to desipramine alone in severely depressed patients. Patients with DSM-III-R major depression were randomized to double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment with either lithium + desipramine or placebo + desipramine for 4 weeks. Response criteria were based on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores and global improvement. Analysis of covariance of Hamilton scores demonstrated that lithium + desipramine was superior to placebo + desipramine at week 1 (P < 0.009), week 2 (P < 0.028), and week 3 (P < 0.07), although not at week 4. There were more responders to the combination than to monotherapy (P < 0.042). These preliminary data suggest that lithium + desipramine may have some efficacy in severely depressed patients. Further studies with larger samples are needed to confirm these findings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cappiello A ; McDougle CJ ; Delgado PL ; Malison RT ; Jatlow P ; Charney DS ; Heninger GR ; Price LH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00004850-199809000-00001 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDesipramine/*therapeutic use\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nTime Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cappiello A, McDougle CJ, Delgado PL, Malison RT, Jatlow P, Charney DS, Heninger GR, and Price LH (1998) Lithium and desipramine versus desipramine alone in the treatment of severe major depression: a preliminary study..

METHOD: A selective literature review. RESULTS: Lithium is widely believed to be effective against acute mania, acute bipolar depression and in relapse prevention to either mania or depression. In fact, the data supporting efficacy in acute treatment are less impressive than is often claimed, whereas for relapse prevention and suicide prevention no other agent has comparable depth of support. Lithium is best described as the bench mark treatment for bipolar disorder, rather than the gold standard, because only a minority of patients show major clinical benefit. There is a developing need for further trials against new alternatives and in combination studies. CONCLUSION: Lithium has a continuing important role in the clinical management of bipolar disorder. Its under-utilization in North America reflects opinion rather than evidence and the demonstrated anti-suicide effects should help to reignite interest in its use.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Carney SM ; Goodwin GM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00521.x ","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nSecondary Prevention\r\nTranquilizing Agents/*therapeutic use\r\n*Suicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Carney SM, and Goodwin GM (2005) Lithium - a continuing story in the treatment of bipolar disorder..

The aim of this paper was to review the available evidence on the various augmenting agents that have been tested for efficacy in TRD. METHODS: Electronic databases and relevant textbooks were searched and the information retrieved was integrated in this review. RESULTS: Although augmentation strategies have been tested with various pharmacological agents, there are few controlled studies published. Lithium, triiodothyronine (T3), buspirone and pindolol have been most widely studied. Other agents include dopaminergic agents, atypical antipsychotics, psychostimulants, benzodiazepines/hypnotics, hormones and anticonvulsants. CONCLUSION: The augmentation therapy with the best evidence was the lithium-antidepressant combination, especially in patients not responding to tricyclic agents.

This review highlights the current status and future research directions of augmentation treatments for TRD with a special focus on research data published within the past year. RECENT FINDINGS: Atypical antipsychotics, stimulants, pindolol, lithium, lamotrigine and mecamylamine were tested for efficacy in clinical trials. Most of the trials were not controlled or had limited sample size. Recent data now support the use of some atypical antipsychotics to augment depression resistant to the newer, more selective, antidepressants. SUMMARY: Lithium and triiodothyronin (T3) augmentation of tricyclic agents remains the best studied strategy. Data converge to demonstrate the efficacy of some atypical antipsychotics as augmenting agents to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Further adequately powered controlled trials on augmentation pharmacotherapy of TRD are necessary.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Carvalho AF ; Machado JR ; Cavalcante JL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/YCO.0b013e32831be9ef ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage\r\nBuspirone/administration & dosage\r\nCentral Nervous System Stimulants/administration & dosage\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\n*Drug Resistance\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/administration & dosage\r\nTreatment Failure\r\nTriiodothyronine/administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Carvalho AF, Machado JR, and Cavalcante JL (2009) Augmentation strategies for treatment-resistant depression..

Notwithstanding numerous advances in the pharmacological treatment of depression, approximately 70% of patients do not remit after first-line antidepressant treatment. METHODS: The MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov electronic databases were searched from inception to October 1, 2013, for randomized controlled trials (RCT), relevant open-label trials, meta-analyses and ongoing trials of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic approaches to treatment-resistant depression (TRD). RESULTS: Switching to a different antidepressant is a useful option following nonresponse to a first-line agent. Although widely used in clinical practice, there is limited evidence to support antidepressant combination for TRD. Notwithstanding evidence for lithium or T3 augmentation to be successful in TRD, most studies were carried out when participants were treated with tricyclic antidepressants (TCA). Of the available strategies to augment the response to new-generation antidepressants, the use of some atypical antipsychotics is best supported by evidence. Several novel therapeutic options are currently discussed. Evidence suggests that cognitive therapy (CT) is an effective strategy for TRD. CONCLUSIONS: The success of switching to a different antidepressant following a first-line agent is supported by evidence, but there is limited evidence for effective combination strategies. Lithium and T3 augmentation of TCA have the strongest evidence base for successful treatment of TRD. The use of augmentation of newer-generation antidepressants with atypical antipsychotics is supported by a growing evidence base. Current evidence supports CT as an effective strategy for TRD.

Depression is a recurrent and disabling psychiatric illness and current evidences support that oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of this psychiatric condition. Here, we evaluated the effect of 3-((4-chlorophenyl)selanyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole (CMI) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive-like behaviour, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in male mice. CMI pre-treatment (20 and 50 mg/kg, intragastrically) significantly attenuated LPS (0.83 mg/kg, intraperitoneally)-induced depressive-like behaviour in mice by reducing the immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST). CMI pre-treatment ameliorated LPS-induced neuroinflammation by reducing the levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-4 and IL-6 in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, as well as markers of oxidative damage. Additionally, we investigated the toxicological effects of CMI (200 mg/kg, i.g.) in the liver, kidney and brain through determination of the activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase (δ-ALA-D) and creatinine levels. These biomarkers were not modified, indicating the possible absence of neuro-, hepato- and nephrotoxic effects. Our results suggest that CMI could be a therapeutic approach for the treatment of depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders associated with inflammation and oxidative stress.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Casaril AM ; Domingues M ; Fronza M ; Vieira B ; Begnini K ; Lenardão EJ ; Seixas FK ; Collares T ; Nogueira CW ; Savegnago L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0269881117711713 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nDepression/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nInflammation/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nInterleukin-1beta/metabolism\r\nInterleukin-4/metabolism\r\nInterleukin-6/metabolism\r\nLipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nOxidative Stress/*drug effects\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/drug effects/metabolism\r\nSelenium/*pharmacology\r\nSwimming\r\nTumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism\r\nOrganoselenium\r\ndepression\r\nneuroinflammation\r\noxidative stress\r\ntoxicity","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Casaril AM, Domingues M, Fronza M, Vieira B, Begnini K, Lenardão EJ, Seixas FK, Collares T, Nogueira CW, and Savegnago L (2017) Antidepressant-like effect of a new selenium-containing compound is accompanied by a reduction of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in lipopolysaccharide-challenged mice..

The treatment for this comorbidity still relies on drugs acting on the serotonergic neurotransmission, but the modulation of immune-inflammatory pathways has attained an increasing interest in the drug discovery. We have previously demonstrated that the selenoorganic compound 3-[(4-chlorophenyl)selanyl]-1-methyl-1H-indole (CMI) possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive and antidepressant-like effect in mice. Considering these pharmacological properties and the structural similarities between tryptophan, serotonin and CMI, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether CMI ameliorates depression- and anxiogenic-like behavior induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Swiss male mice by modulating the serotonergic system and reducing neuroinflammation. The administration of CMI (1 mg/kg, i.g) reversed the behavioral deficits induced by LPS (0.83 mg/kg, i.p) in the tail suspension test, splash test and elevated plus maze. The pre-treatment of mice with WAY100635 (5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist), ketanserin (5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist) and ondansetron (5-HT(3) receptor antagonist) prevented the antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effect elicited by CMI treatment after the LPS challenge. The administration of CMI also counteracted the increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of mice challenged with LPS. Additionally, a molecular docking analysis showed that CMI binds to the active site of the serotonin transporter and IDO. These findings suggest that CMI reversed behavioral and biochemical alterations in the depression-anxiety comorbidity induced by LPS, possibly by modulation of neuroinflammatory mediators and the serotonergic system.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Casaril AM ; Domingues M ; de Andrade Lourenço D; Birmann PT ; Padilha N ; Vieira B ; Begnini K ; Seixas FK ; Collares T ; Lenardão EJ ; Savegnago L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2019.05.006 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnti-Anxiety Agents/*pharmacology\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nAnxiety/chemically induced/*drug therapy/immunology\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nDepression/chemically induced/*drug therapy/immunology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nHippocampus/*drug effects\r\nIndoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/*drug effects\r\nIndoles/*pharmacology\r\nLipopolysaccharides\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMolecular Docking Simulation\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/*drug effects\r\nSelenium Compounds/*pharmacology\r\nSerotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*drug effects\r\nAntidepressant\r\nAnxiolytic\r\nMolecular docking\r\nNeuroinflammation\r\nOrganoselenium\r\nSerotonin","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Casaril AM, Domingues M, de Andrade Lourenço D, Birmann PT, Padilha N, Vieira B, Begnini K, Seixas FK, Collares T, Lenardão EJ, and Savegnago L (2019) Depression- and anxiogenic-like behaviors induced by lipopolysaccharide in mice are reversed by a selenium-containing indolyl compound: Behavioral, neurochemical and computational insights involving the serotonergic system..

Therefore, the investigation of novel agents and the characterization of the molecular signaling pathways underlying their effects are needed. The organoselenium compound 3-[(4-chlorophenyl)selanyl]-1-methyl-1H-indole (CMI) has emerged as a promising antidepressant and anxiolytic molecule in several animal models of depression through the modulation of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. In light of this, the present study aimed to dive into the mechanism of action of CMI in ameliorating anhedonic- and anxiogenic-like behaviors induced by repeated corticosterone administration in mice. A single administration of CMI (1 ​mg/kg, i.g.) abrogated the behavioral alterations induced by corticosterone in the open field test, splash test, and elevated plus maze test. Additionally, CMI treatment decreased the levels of reactive species and lipid peroxidation in the plasma of corticosterone-treated mice and normalized the expression of GR, BDNF, synaptophysin, GSK-3β, Nrf (2) , and IDO in the hippocampi of stressed mice. Noteworthy, the pre-treatment of mice with LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) and rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor) abrogated the anti-anhedonic- and anxiolytic-like effects elicited by CMI in corticosterone-treated mice, while ZnPP (HO-1 inhibitor) counteracted the anxiolytic-like effect of CMI. These findings suggest that CMI might ameliorate behavioral and biochemical alterations in the depression-anxiety comorbidity induced by corticosterone, highlighting the potential of CMI as a possible adjuvant therapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Casaril AM ; Lourenço DA ; Domingues M ; Smaniotto TÂ ; Birmann PT ; Vieira B ; Sonego MS ; Seixas FK ; Collares T ; Lenardão EJ ; Savegnago L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.cpnec.2021.100054 ","Keywords":"Antidepressant\r\nAnxiolytic\r\nCorticosterone\r\nHPA axis\r\nOrganoselenium\r\nPI3K/mTOR","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Casaril AM, Lourenço DA, Domingues M, Smaniotto TÂ, Birmann PT, Vieira B, Sonego MS, Seixas FK, Collares T, Lenardão EJ, and Savegnago L (2021) Anhedonic- and anxiogenic-like behaviors and neurochemical alterations are abolished by a single administration of a selenium-containing compound in chronically stressed mice..

The magnitude of the problem will become greater as this segment of the population grows. Depression is often overlooked in the elderly, contributing to a greater risk of suicide in this group than in younger patients. Depression may be masked by hypochondriasis or somatization. Special problems in diagnosis include bipolar disorder, pseudodementia, pathological grief, and organic mood disorder as related to medications or physical illness. Pharmacokinetic changes with aging need to be kept in mind by physicians treating the elderly with antidepressant medications. Tricyclic antidepressants are the traditional first line pharmacologic agents. Tricyclics with a low side effect profile, such as desipramine or nortriptyline, are generally preferred. However, newer medications including serotonin reuptake inhibitors and bupropion are becoming more widely used. Other medications, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lithium, and stimulants, also have a place in the treatment of depression in old age. Electroconvulsive therapy is a useful treatment for patients with treatment-resistant or psychotic depression. Psychotherapy in the elderly has not been well studied, but is believed to be effective if patients are properly selected for therapy and appropriate modifications are made.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Casey DA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAging/psychology\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/etiology\r\nDepression/diagnosis/etiology/*therapy\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nGrief\r\nHumans\r\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/therapeutic use\r\nPsychotherapy\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use\r\nStress, Psychological/complications\r\nSuicide","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Casey DA (1994) Depression in the elderly..

The present data indicates that the pretreatment with Li (47.5 mg/kg) or VPA (200 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal route during 7 consecutive days was able to prevent olfactory discrimination and short-term memory impairments evaluated in the social recognition and step-down inhibitory avoidance tasks in rats infused with a single intranasal (i.n.) administration of MPTP (0.1 mg/nostril). Despite the absence of clear depressive-like responses following the current MPTP dose, Li and VPA treatment presented an antidepressant profile reducing the immobility time in the forced swimming test. Importantly, at this time no significant alterations on the locomotor activity of the animals were observed in the open field test. Moreover, Li and VPA prevented dopamine depletion in the olfactory bulb and striatum of MPTP-infused rats. These results provide new insights in experimental models of PD, indicating that Li and VPA may represent new therapeutic tools for the management of olfactory and cognitive symptoms associated to early preclinical phases of PD, together with their neuroprotective potential demonstrated in previous research.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Castro AA ; Ghisoni K ; Latini A ; Quevedo J ; Tasca CI ; Prediger RD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2012.01.016 ","Keywords":"1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/administration & dosage\r\nAdministration, Intranasal\r\nAge Factors\r\nAnimals\r\nAnimals, Newborn\r\nAvoidance Learning/drug effects\r\nChromatography, High Pressure Liquid\r\nDiscrimination, Psychological/*drug effects\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDopamine/metabolism\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Interactions\r\nExploratory Behavior/drug effects\r\nLithium/*administration & dosage\r\nMale\r\nMemory Disorders/etiology/*prevention & control\r\nMemory, Short-Term/*drug effects\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nNeurotoxins/administration & dosage\r\nOlfaction Disorders/etiology/*prevention & control\r\nParkinsonian Disorders/chemically induced/complications\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nRecognition, Psychology/drug effects\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nStatistics, Nonparametric\r\nSwimming/psychology\r\nValproic Acid/*administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Castro AA, Ghisoni K, Latini A, Quevedo J, Tasca CI, and Prediger RD (2012) Lithium and valproate prevent olfactory discrimination and short-term memory impairments in the intranasal 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) rat model of Parkinson's disease..

No effective approved drugs are currently available for its treatment. Several studies have proposed symptomatic treatment with melatonin and zinc supplementation in chronic illnesses; however, little is known about the synergistic effect of this treatment on fatigue-related symptoms in ME/CFS. The primary endpoint of the study was to assess the effect of oral melatonin plus zinc supplementation on fatigue in ME/CFS. Secondary measures included participants' sleep disturbances, anxiety/depression and health-related quality of life. A proof-of-concept, 16-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted in 50 ME/CFS patients assigned to receive either oral melatonin (1 mg) plus zinc (10 mg) supplementation (n = 24) or matching placebo (n = 26) once daily. Endpoint outcomes were evaluated at baseline, and then reassessed at 8 and 16 weeks of treatment and 4 weeks after treatment cessation, using self-reported outcome measures. The most relevant results were the significant reduction in the perception of physical fatigue in the Mel-Zinc group at the final treatment follow-up versus placebo (p < 0.05), and the significant improvement in the physical component summary at all follow-up visits in the experimental group. Urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels were significantly elevated though the treatment in experimental group vs. placebo (p < 0.0001); however, no significantly differences were observed for zinc concentration among participants. Our findings suggest that oral melatonin plus zinc supplementation for 16 weeks is safe and potentially effective in reducing fatigue and improving the quality of life in ME/CFS. This clinical study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03000777).","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Castro-Marrero J ; Zaragozá MC ; López-Vílchez I ; Galmés JL ; Cordobilla B ; Maurel S ; Domingo JC ; Alegre-Martín J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/antiox10071010 ","Keywords":"chronic fatigue syndrome\r\nfatigue\r\nmelatonin\r\nmyalgic encephalomyelitis\r\nquality of life\r\nsleep quality\r\nzinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Castro-Marrero J, Zaragozá MC, López-Vílchez I, Galmés JL, Cordobilla B, Maurel S, Domingo JC, and Alegre-Martín J (2021) Effect of Melatonin Plus Zinc Supplementation on Fatigue Perception in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial..

The choice of agent ranges from newer atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, quetiapine) to older agents including buspirone, liothyronine (T3), and lithium. We sought to better understand the differences among these agents to aid in clinical decision making. METHODS: We conducted a focused review of the support for each of the aforementioned agents in antidepressant augmentation. We then compared the approximate out-of-pocket cost for each medication during a typical augmentation trial using the typical prescription costs on ClinCalc.com derived from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We calculated the cost to achieve response for one patient with TRD based on the number needed to treat (NNT). FINDINGS: We observed significant variance in cost to achieve response based on the NNT derived from our review of each of the medications. For example, the overall out-of-pocket cost for one patient to achieve response with aripiprazole (the costliest generic agent) could cover lithium prescriptions for 4 to 5 patients with TRD to achieve response. Although brexpiprazole was estimated separately because of its brand name cost, we estimated that 324 patients receiving lithium could achieve response for same cost of single patient receiving brexpiprazole. IMPLICATIONS: These findings suggest that among augmentation agents, there are differences in cost that may be highly important in clinical decision making. Other issues of medication monitoring may incur additional costs, and brand name medications offer significantly greater complexity and potential out-of-pocket costs to patients. The use of lithium as a first-line agent for TRD should be considered based on low cost, lowest NNT, and data in support of its efficacy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Catalano G ; Robeel RA ; Cheney GA ; Spurling BC ; Catalano MC ; Schultz SK ; Sanchez DL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/JCP.0000000000001236 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*economics/therapeutic use\r\n*Clinical Decision-Making\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/drug therapy/*economics\r\nDrug Costs/*statistics & numerical data\r\nHumans\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/*economics/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Catalano G, Robeel RA, Cheney GA, Spurling BC, Catalano MC, Schultz SK, and Sanchez DL (2020) Antidepressant Augmentation: A Review of the Literature and a Review of the Pharmacoeconomic Considerations..

Lithium (Li) represents the mainstay of BD pharmacotherapy, despite the narrow therapeutic index and the high variability in treatment response. However, although several studies have been conducted, the molecular mechanisms underlying Li therapeutic effects remain unclear. METHODS: In order to identify molecular signatures and biological pathways associated with Li treatment response, we conducted transcriptome and miRNome microarray analyses on lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 20 patients diagnosed with BD classified as Li responders (n = 11) or non-responders (n = 9). RESULTS: We found 335 mRNAs and 77 microRNAs (miRNAs) significantly modulated in BD responders versus non-responders. Interestingly, pathway and network analyses on these differentially expressed molecules suggested a modulatory effect of Li on several immune-related functions. Indeed, among the functional molecular nodes, we found NF-κB and TNF. Moreover, networks related to these molecules resulted overall inhibited in BD responder patients, suggesting anti-inflammatory properties of Li. From the integrative analysis between transcriptomics and miRNomics data carried out using miRComb R package on the same samples from patients diagnosed with BD, we found 97 significantly and negatively correlated mRNA-miRNA pairs, mainly involved in inflammatory/immune response. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight that Li exerts modulatory effects on immune-related functions and that epigenetic mechanisms, especially miRNAs, can influence the modulation of different genes and pathways involved in Li response. Moreover, our data suggest the potentiality to integrate data coming from different high-throughput approaches as a tool to prioritize genes and pathways.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cattane N ; Courtin C ; Mombelli E ; Maj C ; Mora C ; Etain B ; Bellivier F ; Marie-Claire C ; Cattaneo A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12888-022-04286-3 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/genetics\r\nTranscriptome\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use\r\n*MicroRNAs/genetics/therapeutic use\r\nRNA, Messenger/genetics\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nGene expression\r\nLithium\r\nLymphoblastoid cell line\r\nTranscriptome and miRNome integrative analysis\r\nmicroRNAs","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cattane N, Courtin C, Mombelli E, Maj C, Mora C, Etain B, Bellivier F, Marie-Claire C, and Cattaneo A (2022) Transcriptomics and miRNomics data integration in lymphoblastoid cells highlights the key role of immune-related functions in lithium treatment response in Bipolar disorder..

Pharmacological treatment studies in PBD have lagged far behind those in adults. Children are currently treated with pharmacological agents, most of which have proven efficacy in adults. However, PBD is distinct from adult forms of bipolar disorder (BD) and may present unique treatment challenges. PBD often presents with rapid cycling and mixed manic states and a high co-morbidity with behavioural and attention disorders. Early onset depression may also be an early sign of PBD. Due to developmental considerations, the diagnosis of BD may be difficult to make in children without semi-structured interviews. This report discusses the special issues that should be considered when treating PBD and reviews the current literature regarding pharmacotherapy of this population. Mood stabilisers have been studied mostly in an open, uncontrolled fashion but there is growing evidence that lithium, divalproex and carbamazepine are effective in treating PBD. More recent treatment options include atypical antipsychotics and newer anticonvulsants. Other novel agents are currently being investigated in adult BD and may prove applicable to the paediatric form. Finally, based on the available data, a treatment algorithm for PBD is proposed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chang KD ; Ketter TA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1517/14656566.2.4.613 ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nCarbamazepine/therapeutic use\r\nChild\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nValproic Acid/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chang KD, and Ketter TA (2001) Special issues in the treatment of paediatric bipolar disorder..

To date, bipolar depression is often misdiagnosed and ineffectively managed both for acute episodes and residual symptoms. This review attempts to summarize the current status of available treatment strategies in the treatment of bipolar depression. For acute and prophylactic treatment, a substantial body of evidence supports the antidepressive efficacy of lithium for bipolar disorders and its antisuicidal effects. Among numerous anticonvulsants with mood-stabilizing properties, valproate and lamotrigine could be first-line options for bipolar depression. Due to receptor profile, mood-stabilizing properties of second-generation antipsychotics have been explored, and up to date, quetiapine and olanzapine appear to be a reasonable option for bipolar depression. The usefulness of antidepressants in bipolar depression is still controversial. Current guidelines generally recommend the cautious antidepressant use in combination with mood stabilizers to reduce the risk of mood elevation or cycle acceleration. Results from clinical trials on psychosocial intervention are promising, especially when integrated with pharmacotherapy. Most patients with bipolar depression need individualized and combined treatment, although the published evidence on this type of treatment strategy is limited. Future studies on the utility of currently available agents and modalities including psychosocial intervention are required.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chang JS ; Ha K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4103/0253-7176.85390 ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants\r\nantidepressants\r\nbipolar depression\r\nlithium\r\npsychosocial intervention\r\nsecond-generation antipsychotics","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chang JS, and Ha K (2011) Management of bipolar depression..

We conducted a search of MEDLINE for relevant studies of augmentation strategies using randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses, and we summarize and discuss the various agents other than atypical antipsychotics. Lithium and thyroid hormone augmentation may improve the response of tricyclic antidepressants but not that of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The efficacy of augmentation with modafinil, buspirone, methylphenidate, folic acid, pindolol and lamotrigine is limited or equivocal.

METHODS: We selected subgroups from a sample of 1761 patients of Han Chinese descent with bipolar I disorder who were recruited by the Taiwan Bipolar Consortium. We assessed their response to lithium treatment using the Alda scale and performed a genomewide association study on samples from one subgroup of 294 patients with bipolar I disorder who were receiving lithium treatment. We then tested the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that showed the strongest association with a response to lithium for association in a replication sample of 100 patients and tested them further in a follow-up sample of 24 patients. We sequenced the exons, exon-intron boundaries, and part of the promoter of the gene encoding glutamate decarboxylase-like protein 1 (GADL1) in 94 patients who had a response to lithium and in 94 patients who did not have a response in the genomewide association sample. RESULTS: Two SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium, rs17026688 and rs17026651, that are located in the introns of GADL1 showed the strongest associations in the genomewide association study (P=5.50×10(-37) and P=2.52×10(-37), respectively) and in the replication sample of 100 patients (P=9.19×10(-15) for each SNP). These two SNPs had a sensitivity of 93% for predicting a response to lithium and differentiated between patients with a good response and those with a poor response in the follow-up cohort. Resequencing of GADL1 revealed a novel variant, IVS8+48delG, which lies in intron 8 of the gene, is in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs17026688 and is predicted to affect splicing. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variations in GADL1 are associated with the response to lithium maintenance treatment for bipolar I disorder in patients of Han Chinese descent.

Given the projected increase and need for data that can inform treatment, this review provides a brief description of newer publications focused on mania in older-age bipolar disorder (OABD), including epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatments. RECENT FINDINGS: Age cutoffs to define OABD range from 50 to 65 years. OABD clinical presentation and course of illness is highly variable, often characterized by mood episode recurrence, medical comorbidity, cognitive deficits, and impaired functioning. There is little pharmacotherapy data on mania in OABD. Lithium and valproate have been tested in a single randomized controlled trial and there is data of more limited quality with other compounds. Treating OABD is challenging due to medical complexity, comorbidity, diminished tolerance to treatment, and a limited evidence base. More data is needed to keep pace with clinical demand.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chen P ; Dols A ; Rej S ; Sajatovic M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11920-017-0804-8 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\n*Aging\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nHumans\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nElderly\r\nGeriatric\r\nMania\r\nManic-depressive disorder\r\nMood stabilizers","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chen P, Dols A, Rej S, and Sajatovic M (2017) Update on the Epidemiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Mania in Older-Age Bipolar Disorder..

Magnesium deficiency contributes to neuroinflammation and is associated with pain, depression, and memory deficits. Neuroinflammation is involved in the mechanical allodynia of cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis. Magnesium-L-Threonate (L-TAMS) supplementation can attenuate neuroinflammation. This study aimed to determine whether and how L-TAMS influences mechanical allodynia and accompanying depressive symptoms and memory deficits in CYP-induced cystitis. METHODS: Injection of CYP (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, every 3 days for 3 doses) was used to establish a rat model of BPS/IC. L-TAMS was administered in drinking water (604 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)). Mechanical allodynia in the lower abdomen was assessed with von Frey filaments using the up-down method. Forced swim test (FST) and sucrose preference test (SPT) were used to measure depressive-like behaviors. Novel object recognition test (NORT) was used to detect short-term memory function. Concentrations of Mg(2+) in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured by calmagite chronometry. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining measured the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α/nuclear factor-κB (TNF-α/NF-κB), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor type 2B subunit (NR2B) of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in the L6-S1 spinal dorsal horn (SDH) and hippocampus. RESULTS: Free Mg(2+) was reduced in the serum and CSF of the CYP-induced cystitis rats on days 8, 12, and 20 after the first CYP injection. Magnesium deficiency in the serum and CSF correlated with the mechanical withdrawal threshold, depressive-like behaviors, and short-term memory deficits (STMD). Oral application of L-TAMS prevented magnesium deficiency and attenuated mechanical allodynia (n = 14) and normalized depressive-like behaviors (n = 10) and STMD (n = 10). The upregulation of TNF-α/NF-κB signaling and IL-1β in the L6-S1 SDH or hippocampus was reversed by L-TAMS. The change in NR2B expression in the SDH and hippocampus in the cystitis model was normalized by L-TAMS. CONCLUSIONS: Normalization of magnesium deficiency by L-TAMS attenuated mechanical allodynia, depressive-like behaviors, and STMD in the CYP-induced cystitis model via inhibition of TNF-α/NF-κВ signaling and normalization of NR2B expression. Our study provides evidence that L-TAMS may have therapeutic value for treating pain and comorbid depression or memory deficits in BPS/IC patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chen JL ; Zhou X ; Liu BL ; Wei XH ; Ding HL ; Lin ZJ ; Zhan HL ; Yang F ; Li WB ; Xie JC ; Su MZ ; Liu XG ; Zhou XF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12974-020-01786-5 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nButyrates/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nCyclophosphamide/adverse effects\r\nCystitis/chemically induced/*complications/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFemale\r\nHyperalgesia/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nMagnesium Deficiency/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nMemory Disorders/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nNF-kappa B/metabolism\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSignal Transduction/*drug effects/physiology\r\nTumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism\r\nBladder pain syndrome\r\nCystitis\r\nDepression\r\nMemory dysfunction\r\nNeuroinflammation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chen JL, Zhou X, Liu BL, Wei XH, Ding HL, Lin ZJ, Zhan HL, Yang F, Li WB, Xie JC, Su MZ, Liu XG, and Zhou XF (2020) Normalization of magnesium deficiency attenuated mechanical allodynia, depressive-like behaviors, and memory deficits associated with cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis by inhibiting TNF-α/NF-κB signaling in female rats..

Preventative interventions that could delay dementia onset even modestly would provide a major public health impact. There are no disease-modifying treatments currently available. Lithium has been proposed as a potential treatment. We assessed the association between lithium use and the incidence of dementia and its subtypes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study comparing patients treated between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2019, using data from electronic clinical records of secondary care mental health (MH) services in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT), United Kingdom (catchment area population approximately 0.86 million). Eligible patients were those aged 50 years or over at baseline and who had at least 1 year follow-up, excluding patients with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia before, or less than 1 year after, their start date. The intervention was the use of lithium. The main outcomes were dementia and its subtypes, diagnosed and classified according to the International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10). In this cohort, 29,618 patients (of whom 548 were exposed to lithium) were included. Their mean age was 73.9 years. A total of 40.2% were male, 33.3% were married or in a civil partnership, and 71.0% were of white ethnicity. Lithium-exposed patients were more likely to be married, cohabiting or in a civil partnership, to be a current/former smoker, to have used antipsychotics, and to have comorbid depression, mania/bipolar affective disorder (BPAD), hypertension, central vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemias. No significant difference between the 2 groups was observed for other characteristics, including age, sex, and alcohol-related disorders. In the exposed cohort, 53 (9.7%) patients were diagnosed with dementia, including 36 (6.8%) with Alzheimer disease (AD) and 13 (2.6%) with vascular dementia (VD). In the unexposed cohort, corresponding numbers were the following: dementia 3,244 (11.2%), AD 2,276 (8.1%), and VD 698 (2.6%). After controlling for sociodemographic factors, smoking status, other medications, other mental comorbidities, and physical comorbidities, lithium use was associated with a lower risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40 to 0.78), including AD (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.82) and VD (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.69). Lithium appeared protective in short-term (≤1-year exposure) and long-term lithium users (>5-year exposure); a lack of difference for intermediate durations was likely due to lack of power, but there was some evidence for additional benefit with longer exposure durations. The main limitation was the handling of BPAD, the most common reason for lithium prescription but also a risk factor for dementia. This potential confounder would most likely cause an increase in dementia in the exposed group, whereas we found the opposite, and the sensitivity analysis confirmed the primary results. However, the specific nature of the group of patients exposed to lithium means that caution is needed in extending these findings to the general population. Another limitation is that our sample size of patients using lithium was small, reflected in the wide CIs for results relating to some durations of lithium exposure, although again sensitivity analyses remained consistent with our primary findings. CONCLUSIONS: We observed an association between lithium use and a decreased risk of developing dementia. This lends further support to the idea that lithium may be a disease-modifying treatment for dementia and that this is a promising treatment to take forwards to larger randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for this indication.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chen S ; Underwood BR ; Jones PB ; Lewis JR ; Cardinal RN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pmed.1003941 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\n*Alzheimer Disease/epidemiology\r\nCohort Studies\r\n*Dementia, Vascular\r\nHumans\r\nIncidence\r\nLithium\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chen S, Underwood BR, Jones PB, Lewis JR, and Cardinal RN (2022) Association between lithium use and the incidence of dementia and its subtypes: A retrospective cohort study..

Lithium (Li(+)), the archetypal mood stabiliser, is neuroprotective in animal models of stroke, albeit underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We discover that Li(+) inhibits activation of nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) stroke model in mice. This action of Li(+) is mediated by two signalling pathways of AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin and AKT/FoxO3a/β-catenin which converge in suppressing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using immunocytochemstry, MRI imaging, and cell sorting with subsequent mRNA and protein quantification, we demonstrate that Li(+) decreases the infarct volume, improves motor function, and alleviates associated cognitive and depressive impairments. In conclusion, this study reveals molecular mechanisms of Li(+) neuroprotection during brain ischaemia, thus providing the theoretical background to extend clinical applications of Li(+) for treatment of ischemic stroke.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chen B ; Zhang M ; Ji M ; Zhang D ; Chen B ; Gong W ; Li X ; Zhou Y ; Dong C ; Wen G ; Zhan X ; Wu X ; Yuan H ; Xu E ; Xia M ; Verkhratsky A ; Li B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s42003-022-03051-2 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nCognitive Dysfunction/drug therapy\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nGene Expression Regulation/drug effects\r\nIschemic Stroke/*drug therapy/pathology\r\nLithium/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Transgenic\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology\r\nRNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism\r\nRandom Allocation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chen B, Zhang M, Ji M, Zhang D, Chen B, Gong W, Li X, Zhou Y, Dong C, Wen G, Zhan X, Wu X, Yuan H, Xu E, Xia M, Verkhratsky A, and Li B (2022) The neuroprotective mechanism of lithium after ischaemic stroke..

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are independent (r² < 0.01) and are strongly related to minerals (p < 5 × 10(-8)) are selected as instrumental variables. Each standard deviation increase in magnesium (0.16 mmol/L) is associated with an 8.94-fold increase in the risk of RA (p = 0.044) and an 8.78-fold increase in BD (p = 0.040) but a 0.10 g/cm² increase in bone density related to OP (p = 0.014). Each per-unit increase in copper is associated with a 0.87-fold increase in the risk of AD (p = 0.050) and BD (p = 0.010). In addition, there is suggestive evidence that calcium is positively correlated (OR = 1.36, p = 0.030) and iron is negatively correlated with T2D risk (OR = 0.89, p = 0.010); both magnesium (OR = 0.26, p = 0.013) and iron (OR = 0.71, p = 0.047) are negatively correlated with gout risk. In the sensitivity analysis, causal estimation is not affected by pleiotropy. This study supports the long-standing hypothesis that magnesium supplementation can increase RA and BD risks and decrease OP risk and that copper intake can reduce AD and BD risks.

Nevertheless, drug therapy isn't often enough to treat this condition. Researchers are evaluating the possible impact of a preventive approach, based on an improvement of lifestyle and the intake of micronutrients. Moreover, there is an increasing interest for combined nutraceuticals that can act as memory and learning enhancers, with a significant and beneficial potential on the cognitive disorders. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a rational assemblage of nutraceuticals on cognitive functions in a sample of 30 elderly subjects. DESIGN: Double bind, cross-over designed trial versus placebo Setting: outpatient clinical practice. PARTICIPANTS: 30 elderly subjects with basal Mini-Mental State Examination score between 20 and 27 and self-perceived cognitive decline. INTERVENTION: Treatment with a combination of nutraceuticals based on Bacopa monnieri, L-theanine, Crocus sativus, copper, folate and vitamins of B and D group. After2 months of treatment or placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were evaluated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and Index and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SRDS). RESULTS: MMSE and PSQ Index significantly improved in the active treatment arm, both versus baseline and versus the parallel arm. Both groups experienced a significant improving in the SRDS scores. CONCLUSIONS: We obtained a good and significant improvement of the cognitive functions tested with the MMSE, PSQ-Index and SRDS score, after 2 months of combined therapy of nutraceuticals. Further confirmation will be needed to verify these observations on the middle and long term in a larger number of subjects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cicero AF ; Bove M ; Colletti A ; Rizzo M ; Fogacci F ; Giovannini M ; Borghi C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.14283/jpad.2016.10 ","Keywords":"*Cognition\r\nCognitive Dysfunction/complications/*diet therapy/psychology\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\nDepression/complications/*diet therapy\r\nDiagnostic Self Evaluation\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nHumans\r\nNeuropsychological Tests\r\nPerception\r\nPilot Projects\r\nStress, Psychological/complications/*diet therapy\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nClinical trial\r\ncognitive impairment\r\ndepression\r\ndietary supplement\r\nelderly","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cicero AF, Bove M, Colletti A, Rizzo M, Fogacci F, Giovannini M, and Borghi C (2017) Short-Term Impact of a Combined Nutraceutical on Cognitive Function, Perceived Stress and Depression in Young Elderly with Cognitive Impairment: A Pilot, Double-Blind, Randomized Clinical Trial..

In recent years, the number of BD diagnoses has risen considerably in children and adolescents. Itis believed that anaverage rate of prevalence of bipolar spectrum disorder in the pediatric population is 1.8%, and BD type I - 1.2%, and the prevalence of the disorder increases with the age of patients. Despite the same diagnostic criteria, there are premises that suggest thatthe symptoms of the disorder are present with a different frequency among children and adolescents than in adults. The most frequent manic symptom in persons with childhood-onset of the illness is thought to be irritability, and in adolescence -hyperactivity. BD in children and adolescent population is accompanied by a high rate of comorbid psychiatric conditions. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and borderline personality disorder constitute particular diagnostic challenges. Early onset of BP is linked with a more severe course of the illness, worse prognosis, and a higher suicidal rate. Pharmacotherapy of BD in the pediatric population includes 1st and 2nd generation mood stabilizers, while their efficacy and safety profiles are different than in adults. The American Food and Drug Administration recommends treating manic episodes in young persons with lithium, aripiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone, olanzapine and depressive episodes with a combination therapy of olanzapine and fluoxetine.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cichoń L ; Janas-Kozik M ; Siwiec A ; Rybakowski JK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.12740/PP/OnlineFirst/92740 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAge Factors\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAttention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/complications\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/prevention & control\r\nBorderline Personality Disorder/complications\r\nChild\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ntherapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cichoń L, Janas-Kozik M, Siwiec A, and Rybakowski JK (2020) Clinical picture and treatment of bipolar affective disorder in children and adolescents..

Recent studies have shown that zinc exhibits antidepressant-like activity in some models of depression in rodents. Our previous studies have shown that the footshock-induced fighting behavior was reduced in the rats subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). This test is used as the new experimental model of depression. Various antidepressant drugs given repeatedly prevented this kind of behavioral depression. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of prolonged treatment with zinc hydroaspartate and to examine if zinc supplementation could modulate the imipramine effect in CUS model of behavioral depression in rats. The experiments were carried out on male Wistar rats. Chronic stress (persisting for 16 days) was induced by the modified method described by Katz et al. Zinc hydroaspartate at the dose of 30 mg/kg/day or 15 mg/kg/day and imipramine at the dose of 5 mg/kg/day were administered once daily for 14 days. Imipramine was given (ip) 1 h before every stress session and zinc hydroaspartate (ip) l h before the antidepressant. The footshock-induced fighting behavior test was performed 48 h after the last session of the chronic stress. It was demonstrated that in chronically stressed rats the number of fighting attacks was significantly reduced (by about 75%). Zinc hydroaspartate at the dose of 30 mg/kg/day, given alone, prevented the deficit in fighting behavior in chronically stressed rats. Neither imipramine at the dose of 5 mg/kg/day nor zinc hydroaspartate (15 mg/kg/day) administered alone changed the intensity of fighting behavior in chronically stressed rats. However, when imipramine was given at the same dose in the rats pretreated with zinc hydroaspartate (15 mg/kg/day) the deficit of fighting behavior was not observed. The present results indicate that zinc similarly to antidepressants protects the rats against the CUS-induced behavioral depression. Moreover, our findings suggest that zinc supplementation could potentiate the antidepressant effect of imipramine.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cieślik K ; Klenk-Majewska B ; Danilczuk Z ; Wróbel A ; Łupina T ; Ossowska G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Aggression/drug effects\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nChronic Disease\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nImipramine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nStress, Psychological/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nZinc/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cieślik K, Klenk-Majewska B, Danilczuk Z, Wróbel A, Łupina T, and Ossowska G (2007) Influence of zinc supplementation on imipramine effect in a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model in rats..

METHOD: The data source was the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register, incorporating results of searches of MEDLINE (1966-June 2002), EMBASE (1980-June 2002), CINAHL (1982-March 2001), PsycLIT (1974-June 2002), PSYNDEX (1977-October 1999), and LILACS (1982-March 2001). The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) was searched with the term \"lithium\" for new records entered into the database from 1999 to 2003. Studies selected included randomized, controlled trials comparing lithium with placebo or all other compounds used in long-term treatment for mood disorders (unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, dysthymia, and rapid cycling, diagnosed according to DSM or ICD criteria). Of 727 references identified in the search, 52 articles were marked as possibly relevant on the basis of the abstract, and 32 randomized, controlled trials were eligible for inclusion in the review. Two independent reviewers extracted the data, and disagreements were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. Methodological quality was assessed according to the criteria of the Cochrane Collaboration. When the outcomes of interest were not reported, an attempt was made to obtain the required data from the original authors. RESULTS: In 32 trials, 1,389 patients were randomly assigned to receive lithium and 2,069 to receive other compounds. Patients who received lithium were less likely to die by suicide (data from seven trials; two versus 11 suicides; odds ratio=0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.09-0.77). The composite measure of suicide plus deliberate self-harm was also lower in patients who received lithium (odds ratio=0.21; 95% CI=0.08-0.50). There were fewer deaths overall in patients who received lithium (data from 11 trials; nine versus 22 deaths; odds ratio=0.42, 95% CI=0.21-0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Lithium is effective in the prevention of suicide, deliberate self-harm, and death from all causes in patients with mood disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cipriani A ; Pretty H ; Hawton K ; Geddes JR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ajp.162.10.1805 ","Keywords":"Cause of Death\r\nConfidence Intervals\r\nDatabases, Bibliographic\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMood Disorders/drug therapy/*mortality/*psychology\r\nOdds Ratio\r\nPlacebos\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data\r\nSuicide/psychology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\n*Suicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cipriani A, Pretty H, Hawton K, and Geddes JR (2005) Lithium in the prevention of suicidal behavior and all-cause mortality in patients with mood disorders: a systematic review of randomized trials..

However, there is considerable uncertainty about which pharmacological intervention is most effective in the long-term treatment of recurrent unipolar affective disorder. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of lithium versus antidepressants for the long-term treatment of recurrent affective disorder. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) on 2/9/2005. Reference lists of relevant papers and major textbooks of affective disorder were checked. Experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies were contacted regarding unpublished material. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing lithium against antidepressant medication for the long-term treatment of patients with a diagnosis of affective disorder. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected adverse effects information from the trials. MAIN RESULTS: Eight trials involving 475 people were included. Two of the studies included a mixed group of participants with either bipolar or unipolar disorder. Relapse was defined as admission to hospital and when all kinds of relapses were considered (both depressive and manic), there was a statistically significant difference in favour of lithium (relative risk (RR) fixed effect 0.34, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.82). The results did not exclude the point of no effect, when the random-effects model was used (RR random effects 0.40, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.18). There were no other statistically significant differences between lithium and antidepressants according to all other outcomes considered. Manic or depressive relapse was defined as prescription of non-study medication for mood disorder, manic or depressive relapse (as defined by the study authors), quality of life, social functioning, occupational functioning, overall drop-out rate, drop-out rate due to side-effects, troublesome side-effects, mortality due to all causes and specifically suicides. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was adequate efficacy evidence for lithium or antidepressants preventing relapse in unipolar affective disorder, however their relative efficacy was unknown. When considering lithium or antidepressant long-term therapy, patients and clinicians should take into account the patient's clinical history, the side-effects and the individual's likely adherence to the recommended treatment regime. Large-scale, long-term randomised trials in unselected groups of subjects with unipolar affective disorder are needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cipriani A ; Smith K ; Burgess S ; Carney S ; Goodwin G ; Geddes J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD003492.pub2 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cipriani A, Smith K, Burgess S, Carney S, Goodwin G, and Geddes J (2006) Lithium versus antidepressants in the long-term treatment of unipolar affective disorder..

In mild to moderate depression, there is no reliable evidence that any one treatment is superior in improving symptoms of depression, but the strength of evidence supporting different treatments varies. In severe depression, only prescription antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy are known to improve symptoms. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in mild to moderate and severe depression, and in treatment-resistant depression? Which interventions reduce relapse rates? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 88 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antidepressant drugs (tricyclic antidepressants [including low-dose tricyclic antidepressants], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or venlafaxine), continuing prescription antidepressant drugs, electroconvulsive therapy, exercise, lithium augmentation, pindolol augmentation, and St John's wort.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cipriani A ; Barbui C ; Butler R ; Hatcher S ; Geddes J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/administration & dosage\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use\r\n*Depression/drug therapy\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nGene Library\r\nHumans\r\nHypericum\r\nUnited States Food and Drug Administration","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cipriani A, Barbui C, Butler R, Hatcher S, and Geddes J (2011) Depression in adults: drug and physical treatments..

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, web based clinical trial registries, major textbooks, authors of important papers and other experts in the discipline, and websites of pharmaceutical companies that manufacture lithium or the comparator drugs (up to January 2013). INCLUSION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing lithium with placebo or active drugs in long term treatment for mood disorders. REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers assessed studies for inclusion and risk of bias and extracted data. The main outcomes were the number of people who completed suicide, engaged in deliberate self harm, and died from any cause. RESULTS: 48 randomised controlled trials (6674 participants, 15 comparisons) were included. Lithium was more effective than placebo in reducing the number of suicides (odds ratio 0.13, 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.66) and deaths from any cause (0.38, 0.15 to 0.95). No clear benefits were observed for lithium compared with placebo in preventing deliberate self harm (0.60, 0.27 to 1.32). In unipolar depression, lithium was associated with a reduced risk of suicide (0.36, 0.13 to 0.98) and also the number of total deaths (0.13, 0.02 to 0.76) compared with placebo. When lithium was compared with each active individual treatment a statistically significant difference was found only with carbamazepine for deliberate self harm. Lithium tended to be generally better than the other active comparators, with small statistical variation between the results. CONCLUSIONS: Lithium is an effective treatment for reducing the risk of suicide in people with mood disorders. Lithium may exert its antisuicidal effects by reducing relapse of mood disorder, but additional mechanisms should also be considered because there is some evidence that lithium decreases aggression and possibly impulsivity, which might be another mechanism mediating the antisuicidal effect.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cipriani A ; Hawton K ; Stockton S ; Geddes JR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1136/bmj.f3646 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/complications/*drug therapy\r\nChild\r\nChild, Preschool\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nSelf-Injurious Behavior/complications/*prevention & control\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult\r\n*Suicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cipriani A, Hawton K, Stockton S, and Geddes JR (2013) Lithium in the prevention of suicide in mood disorders: updated systematic review and meta-analysis..

Mistaking the former for the latter will lead to incorrect treatment and poor outcomes. None of the classic antidepressants, serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors, or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors have ever received regulatory approval as monotherapies for the treatment of bipolar depression. At present, there are only 3 approved medication treatments for bipolar depression: olanzapine/fluoxetine combination, quetiapine (immediate or extended release), and lurasidone (monotherapy or adjunctive to lithium or valproate). All 3 have similar efficacy profiles, but they differ in terms of tolerability. Number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH) can be used to quantify these similarities and differences. The NNTs for response and remission for each of these interventions vs placebo range from 4 to 7, and 5 to 7, respectively, with overlap in terms of their 95% confidence intervals. NNH values less than 10 (vs placebo) were observed for the spontaneously reported adverse events of weight gain and diarrhea for olanzapine/fluoxetine combination (7 and 9, respectively) and somnolence and dry mouth for quetiapine (3 and 4, respectively). There were no NNH values less than 10 (vs placebo) observed with lurasidone treatment. NNH values vs placebo for weight gain of at least 7% from baseline were 6, 16, 58, and 36, for olanzapine/fluoxetine combination, quetiapine, lurasidone monotherapy, and lurasidone combined with lithium or valproate, respectively. Individualizing treatment decisions will require consideration of the different potential adverse events that are more likely to occur with each medication. The metric of the likelihood to be helped or harmed (LHH) is the ratio of NNH to NNT and can illustrate the tradeoffs inherent in selecting medications. A more favorable LHH was noted for treatment with lurasidone. However, OFC and quetiapine monotherapy may still have utility in high urgency situations, particularly in persons who have demonstrated good outcomes with these interventions in the past, and where a pressing clinical need for efficacy mitigates their potential tolerability shortcomings. In terms of maintenance therapy, adjunctive quetiapine is the only agent where the NNT vs lithium or valproate alone is less than 10 for both the prevention of mania and the prevention of depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Citrome L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S109285291400056X ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBenzodiazepines/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDibenzothiazepines/therapeutic use\r\nDrug Combinations\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFluoxetine/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nIsoindoles/therapeutic use\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use\r\nLurasidone Hydrochloride\r\nQuetiapine Fumarate\r\nThiazoles/therapeutic use\r\nValproic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressants\r\nbipolar depression\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nlikelihood to be helped or harmed\r\nlithium\r\nlurasidone\r\nmajor depressive disorder\r\nnumber need to treat\r\nnumber needed to harm\r\nolanzapine/fluoxetine combination\r\nquetiapine\r\nvalproate","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Citrome L (2014) Treatment of bipolar depression: making sensible decisions..

We randomized 115 bipolar depressed inpatients to receive three cycles of TSD, alone or in combination with morning light exposure, given at an intensity of 150 or 2500 lux. Forty-nine patients were undergoing long-term treatment with lithium salts (at least 6 months), while 66 patients were taking no psychotropic medication. Mood was self-rated by the Visual Analogue Scale three times a day during treatment. The results showed that both light therapy and ongoing lithium treatment significantly enhanced the effects of TSD on the perceived mood, with no additional benefit when the two treatments were combined. Subjective sleepiness during TSD, as rated by the self-administered Stanford Sleepiness Scale, was significantly reduced by light exposure, and was correlated with the outcome. This study confirms the possibility of obtaining a sustained antidepressant response to TSD in bipolar patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Colombo C ; Lucca A ; Benedetti F ; Barbini B ; Campori E ; Smeraldi E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0165-1781(00)00164-5 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAntimanic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/psychology/*therapy\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/*therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Phototherapy\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\n*Sleep Deprivation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Colombo C, Lucca A, Benedetti F, Barbini B, Campori E, and Smeraldi E (2000) Total sleep deprivation combined with lithium and light therapy in the treatment of bipolar depression: replication of main effects and interaction..

Episodes are typically followed by symptom-free periods referred to as euthymia. According to a survey conducted in 2002, one percent (1%) of Canadians 15 years and older demonstrated symptoms satisfying the criteria for bipolar disorder in the previous 12 months. Multiple types of bipolar disorders exist such as bipolar I, bipolar II and are defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (5(th) edition; DSM-V) from the American Psychiatric Association. Symptoms associated with mania can include increased creativity and productivity; however, mania can also lead to immediate hospitalization or involuntary committal under the Mental Health Act. Symptoms associated with depression can lead to increased rates of suicide and suicide ideation. Bipolar disorder with psychotic features refers to manic or depressive episodes including psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations. Psychotic features manifest in over 50% of manic episodes and are more common in the latter than in depressive episodes. Pharmacological treatment usually depends on the type of bipolar disorder (manic or depressive); however, the most common treatments include lithium and valproic acid. Antipsychotic medications are also used to treat bipolar disorder and can be classified as typical (first generation) or atypical (second generation). First generation antipsychotics mitigate bipolar disorder symptoms by antagonizing dopamine D(2) receptors, while second generation antipsychotics have an affinity for serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors and adrenergic receptors in addition to being D(2) receptor antagonists. Atypical antipsychotics, such as aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone can be prescribed as monotherapy or in combination with mood stabilizers and antidepressants, as well as other treatment options. Although combinations of atypical antipsychotics have been used for the treatment of other disorders, such as schizophrenia, the effectiveness of combination therapy in bipolar disorder is unclear. This Rapid Response report aims to review the clinical and cost-effectiveness of combination atypical antipsychotics in adolescents or adults with bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Guidelines associated with the use of combination atypical antipsychotics in adolescents or adults with bipolar disorder with psychotic features will also be examined.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Book, Whole","Authors":"","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":" (2016) Combination Atypical Antipsychotics in Adolescents or Adults with Bipolar Disorder with Psychotic Features: A Review of Clinical and Cost-Effectiveness and Guidelines.

The depressive phases of bipolar disorder can be very disabling, with significant associated comorbidity and suicide risk, impairment in functioning, and infringement on quality of life. We review the current evidence for the management of bipolar depression. METHOD: References for this review were obtained through MEDLINE searches of the medical literature on subjects pertaining to the treatment of bipolar depression. Search terms included bipolar depression, antidepressants, and bipolar disorder. Only publications in English are reviewed here. RESULTS: Lithium is currently the gold standard and most appropriate initial treatment for the depressive phase of bipolar disorder. Other mood stabilizers have demonstrated preliminary efficacy. Of the antidepressants, bupropion and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be associated with less risk of inducing hypomania, mania, and rapid cycling compared with tricyclic antidepressants. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors should be considered for patients with anergic bipolar depression. Electroconvulsive therapy has been shown to be highly efficacious. Other treatment modalities, including psychotherapy, sleep deprivation, phototherapy, and newer medications, require further research. CONCLUSIONS: Although the treatment of bipolar depression can be a complicated clinical task, the treatment armamentarium is expanding. Further research, especially in the form of randomized controlled trials, is warranted. Clinicians should be familiar with general guidelines for the use of psychopharmacologic agents for treating bipolar depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Compton MT ; Nemeroff CB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/psychology/*therapy\r\nBupropion/therapeutic use\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nPhototherapy\r\nPsychotherapy\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use\r\nSleep Deprivation\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Compton MT, and Nemeroff CB (2000) The treatment of bipolar depression..

Despite numerous advances in the pharmacological treatment of depression, many patients remain ill despite initial treatment. Beyond first-line treatment, current guidelines recommend either augmentation or switching of the initial antidepressant. In this narrative review, we summarize the data from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses in order to concisely discuss how the impact of current research can be translated into clinical practice and, ultimately, into lasting improvements in patient outcomes. The augmentation strategies reviewed are lithium, thyroid hormone, pindolol, psychostimulants and second-generation antipsychotics. The data on switching from first-line antidepressants to other antidepressants are also reviewed, and include switching within the same class, switching to other first-line antidepressant classes and switching to less commonly prescribed antidepressants. Finally, the strategy of antidepressant combinations is examined. Overall, the strength of evidence supporting a trial of augmentation or a switch to a new agent is very similar, with remission rates between 25% and 50% in both cases. Our review of the evidence suggests several conclusions. First, although it is true that adjunctive lithium and thyroid hormone have established efficacy, we can only be confident that this is true for use in combination with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and the trials were done in less treatment-resistant patients than those who typically receive TCAs today. Of these two options, triiodothyronine augmentation seems to offer the best benefit/risk ratio for augmentation of modern antidepressants. After failure of a first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), neither a switch within class nor a switch to a different class of antidepressant is unequivocally supported by the data, although switching from an SSRI to venlafaxine or mirtazapine may potentially offer greater benefits. Interestingly, switching from a newer antidepressant to a TCA after a poor response to the former is not supported by strong evidence. Of all strategies to augment response to new-generation antidepressants, quetiapine and aripiprazole are best supported by the evidence, although neither the cost effectiveness nor the longer-term benefit of these strategies has been established. The data to guide later steps in the treatment of resistant depression are sparse. Given the wide variety of options for the treatment of major depressive disorder, and the demonstrated importance of truly adequate treatment to the long-term outcomes of patients facing this illness, it is clear that further well conducted studies are needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Connolly KR ; Thase ME ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2165/11587620-000000000-00000 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\n*Drug Substitution\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination/adverse effects\r\nHumans\r\nPractice Guidelines as Topic\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Connolly KR, and Thase ME (2011) If at first you don't succeed: a review of the evidence for antidepressant augmentation, combination and switching strategies..

DATA SOURCES: A search for evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with bipolar disorder was performed on May 5, 2010, using the National Guideline Clearinghouse database, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Evidence Reports database, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. In addition, a clinical query of the PubMed database (completed March 1, 2010) and searches of drug manufacturers' Web sites (for unpublished trials) were performed to identify randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses evaluating strategies to treat resistant depression. STUDY SELECTION: Guidelines were selected based on data from randomized, controlled trials; meta-analyses; and well-conducted naturalistic trials that were published since 2005. DATA EXTRACTION: Four evidence-based treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder were included. Three were published in 2009: those put forth as part of an Australian project, those of the British Association for Psychopharmacology, and those produced by the International Society for Bipolar Disorders and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments. The most recent US guidelines are that of the Texas Implementation of Medication Algorithms project, last updated in 2005. DATA SYNTHESIS: Recommendations from all 4 guidelines were reviewed and are presented with a focus on using them to improve clinical care. The recommendations with the most agreement and highest level of clinical evidence were as follows: (1) mania should be treated first-line with lithium, divalproex, or an atypical antipsychotic medication; (2) mixed episodes should be treated first-line with divalproex or an atypical antipsychotic; (3) bipolar depression should be treated with quetiapine, olanzapine/fluoxetine combination, or lamotrigine; and (4) all patients should be offered group or individual psychoeducation. Additionally, recommendations for therapeutic drug monitoring are presented due to their importance for patient safety, particularly for the primary care physician, although these are based on consensus guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Bipolar disorder is a lifelong illness that is complicated by high comorbidity and risk of poor health outcomes, making the primary care physician's role vital in improving patient quality of life. The management of acute mood episodes should focus first on safety, should include psychiatric consultation as soon as possible, and should begin with an evidence-based treatment that may be continued into the maintenance phase. Long-term management focuses on maintenance of euthymia, requires ongoing medication, and may benefit from adjunctive psychotherapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Connolly KR ; Thase ME ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/PCC.10r01097 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Connolly KR, and Thase ME (2011) The clinical management of bipolar disorder: a review of evidence-based guidelines..

The evidence to be considered is primarily that arising from randomized controlled trials. A literature search was performed to identify all randomized controlled trials of anticonvulsants used as maintenance treatment for bipolar-I disorder. Placebo-controlled studies were preferred, however there have been relatively few of these and clinical practice must therefore be guided by evidence carrying a lower level of conviction. Valproate monotherapy lacks a convincing evidence base. The view that valproate is more effective than lithium in rapid cycling has not been borne out. Lamotrigine is effective in preventing depression after an episode of mania. As monotherapy, lithium appears superior to carbamazepine in bipolar patients not previously treated with either drug. The combination of lithium and carbamazepine may be superior to either drug alone, in certain treatment-resistant patients, but is associated with increased side effects.

METHOD: The authors conducted an electronic database search and reviewed the 14 articles that fit predetermined criteria. Refractory depression was defined as failure to respond to at least one course of treatment for depression during the current illness episode. The authors rated the validity of studies using a standard checklist and calculated the pooled proportion of response to any treatment reported by at least three studies. RESULTS: All the studies that met inclusion criteria investigated pharmacological treatment. Most were open-label studies, and the authors found no double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials. The overall response rate for all active treatments investigated was 52% (95% CI=42-62; N=381). Only lithium augmentation was assessed in more than two trials, and the response rate was 42% (95% CI=21-65; N=57). Only two studies included comparison groups receiving no additional treatment, and none of the participants in these groups responded. In single randomized studies, extended-release venlafaxine was more efficacious than paroxetine, lithium augmentation more than phenelzine, and selegiline more than placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Half of the participants responded to pharmacological treatments, indicating the importance of managing treatment-refractory depression actively in older people. The only treatment for which there was replicated evidence was lithium augmentation. Double-blind randomized controlled trials for management of treatment-refractory depression in older people, encompassing pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies and populations that reflect the levels of physical and cognitive impairment present in the general older population with depression, are needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cooper C ; Katona C ; Lyketsos K ; Blazer D ; Brodaty H ; Rabins P ; de Mendonça Lima CA; Livingston G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ajp.2011.10081165 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAge Factors\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nClinical Trials as Topic/standards/statistics & numerical data\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/psychology/therapy\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMeta-Analysis as Topic\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPolypharmacy\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic/methods/standards\r\nResearch Design/standards\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cooper C, Katona C, Lyketsos K, Blazer D, Brodaty H, Rabins P, de Mendonça Lima CA, and Livingston G (2011) A systematic review of treatments for refractory depression in older people..

RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical studies and experimental work using animal models have both revealed a link between zinc status and neuropsychological disorders such as depression and anxiety. Not only has zinc deficiency been shown to induce depression-like and anxiety-like behaviors, supplementation has been used as a treatment for major depression. Zinc administration improves the efficacy of antidepressant drugs in depressed patients and may have a particular role to play in treatment-resistant patients. Recent investigations into the molecular mechanisms responsible for these observations suggest a role for zinc in the regulation of neurotransmitter systems, antioxidant mechanisms, neurotrophic factors, and neuronal precursor cells. SUMMARY: The data reviewed here not only indicate a role for zinc deficiency in the development of mood disorders, but also show that zinc may also be important in their treatment. Given the prevalence of zinc deficiency in human populations, this work has the potential to influence strategies to prevent and treat these disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cope EC ; Levenson CW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/MCO.0b013e32833df61a ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/etiology/prevention & control\r\nHumans\r\nZinc/*deficiency/pharmacology/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cope EC, and Levenson CW (2010) Role of zinc in the development and treatment of mood disorders..

Because of the strong link between zinc deficiency, depression, and anxiety, in both humans and rodent models, we hypothesized that dietary zinc supplementation prior to injury could provide behavioral resiliency to lessen the severity of these outcomes after TBI. Rats were fed a marginal zinc deficient (5 ppm), zinc adequate (30 ppm), or zinc supplemented (180 ppm) diet for 4 weeks followed by a moderately-severe TBI using the well-established model of controlled cortical impact (CCI). Following CCI, rats displayed depression-like behaviors as measured by the 2-bottle saccharin preference test for anhedonia. Injury also resulted in evidence of stress and impairments in Morris water maze (MWM) performance compared to sham-injured controls. While moderate zinc deficiency did not worsen outcomes following TBI, rats that were fed the zinc supplemented diet for 4 weeks showed significantly attenuated increases in adrenal weight (p<0.05) as well as reduced depression-like behaviors (p<0.001). Supplementation prior to injury improved resilience such that there was not only significant improvements in cognitive behavior compared to injured rats fed an adequate diet (p<0.01), there were no significant differences between supplemented and sham-operated rats in MWM performance at any point in the 10-day trial. These data suggest a role for supplemental zinc in preventing cognitive and behavioral deficits associated with TBI.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cope EC ; Morris DR ; Scrimgeour AG ; VanLandingham JW ; Levenson CW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.06.007 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBehavioral Symptoms/*diet therapy/*etiology\r\nBody Weight/drug effects/physiology\r\nBrain/metabolism\r\nBrain Injuries/*complications\r\nChoice Behavior\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nEating/drug effects/physiology\r\nMale\r\nMaze Learning/drug effects\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nZinc/*administration & dosage/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cope EC, Morris DR, Scrimgeour AG, VanLandingham JW, and Levenson CW (2011) Zinc supplementation provides behavioral resiliency in a rat model of traumatic brain injury..

OBJECTIVE: This work tests the hypothesis that zinc supplementation after TBI can be used as treatment to improve behavioral outcomes such as anxiety, depression, and learning and memory. METHODS: TBI was induced by controlled cortical impact to the medial frontal cortex. After TBI, rats were fed either a zinc adequate (ZA, 30 ppm) or zinc supplemented (ZS, 180 ppm) diet. Additional rats in each dietary group (ZA or ZS) were given a single intraperitoneal (ip) injection of zinc (30 mg/kg) 1 hour following injury. RESULTS: Brain injury resulted in significant increases in anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors as well as impairments in learning and memory. None of the zinc treatments (dietary or ip zinc) improved TBI-induced anxiety. The 2-bottle saccharin preference test for anhedonia revealed that dietary ZS also did not improve depression-like behaviors. However, dietary ZS combined with an early ip zinc injection significantly reduced anhedonia (P < .001). Dietary supplementation after injury, but not zinc injection, significantly improved (P < .05) cognitive behavior as measured by the time spent finding the hidden platform in the Morris water maze test compared with injured rats fed a ZA diet. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that zinc supplementation may be an effective treatment option for improving behavioral deficits such as cognitive impairment and depression following TBI.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cope EC ; Morris DR ; Scrimgeour AG ; Levenson CW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/1545968311435337 ","Keywords":"Anhedonia/physiology\r\nAnimals\r\nAnxiety/diet therapy/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nBehavior, Animal/*physiology\r\nBrain Injuries/diet therapy/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nCognition Disorders/diet therapy/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDepression/diet therapy/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nInjections\r\nNeuropsychological Tests\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSaccharin\r\nZinc/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cope EC, Morris DR, Scrimgeour AG, and Levenson CW (2012) Use of zinc as a treatment for traumatic brain injury in the rat: effects on cognitive and behavioral outcomes..

We first showed that zinc supplementation prevents the development of the depression-like behavior anhedonia associated with an animal model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). This work then examined the effect of zinc supplementation on the proliferation of new cells in the hippocampus that have the potential to participate in neurogenesis. Rats were fed a zinc adequate (ZA, 30ppm) or zinc supplemented (ZS, 180ppm) diet for 4wk followed by TBI using controlled cortical impact. Stereological counts of EdU-positive cells showed that TBI doubled the density of proliferating cells 24h post-injury (p<0.05), and supplemental zinc significantly increased this by an additional 2-fold (p<0.0001). While the survival of these proliferating cells decreased at the same rate in ZA and in ZS rats after injury, the total density of newly born cells was approximately 60% higher in supplemented rats 1wk after TBI. Furthermore, chronic zinc supplementation resulted in significant increases in the density of new doublecortin-positive neurons one week post-TBI that were maintained for 4wk after injury (p<0.01). While the effect of zinc supplementation on neuronal precursor cells in the hippocampus was robust, use of targeted irradiation to eliminate these cells after zinc supplementation and TBI revealed that these cells are not the sole mechanism through which zinc acts to prevent depression associated with brain injury, and suggest that other zinc dependent mechanisms are needed for the anti-depressant effect of zinc in this model of TBI.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cope EC ; Morris DR ; Gower-Winter SD ; Brownstein NC ; Levenson CW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.expneurol.2016.02.017 ","Keywords":"Anhedonia/drug effects\r\nAnimals\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBrain Injuries/drug therapy/*pathology/*psychology\r\nCell Count\r\nCell Proliferation/*drug effects\r\nCell Survival/drug effects\r\nDepressive Disorder/etiology/prevention & control\r\nDiet\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDoublecortin Domain Proteins\r\nDoublecortin Protein\r\nHippocampus/*pathology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMicrotubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism\r\nNeural Stem Cells/*drug effects\r\nNeurogenesis/drug effects\r\nNeuropeptides/metabolism\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nZinc/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBrain trauma\r\nDepression\r\nHippocampus\r\nNeurogenesis\r\nNeuronal precursor\r\nProliferation\r\nZinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cope EC, Morris DR, Gower-Winter SD, Brownstein NC, and Levenson CW (2016) Effect of zinc supplementation on neuronal precursor proliferation in the rat hippocampus after traumatic brain injury..

In this trial we found that patients who received lithium experienced significantly less morbidity and required significantly less additional antidepressant and antimanic medication, as well as inpatient treatment and electroconvulsive therapy, compared with the patients who received placebo lithium. Subsequent to this trial we established a lithium clinic in which patients, both unipolar and bipolar, were given longterm lithium treatment. The patients attended regularly, usually four to eight times a year, and their clinical state and plasma lithium were regularly monitored and recorded. Patients were given lithium in a sustained-release form, once a day at night. In a careful random, double-blind trial, it was found that the optimum lithium dosage was that which gave a plasma level of 0.5-0.79 mmol/L 12 hours after the nightly dose. In 1982 all patients were switched to this lower dosage, and the recorded morbidity of the group showed a small but significant decline, thus confirming in practice the optimum dosage found in the double-blind trial. I report here the results of the follow-up of a group of 103 patients (67 unipolar, 30 bipolar, and 6 schizoaffective) from January 1977. The patients' mortality and, in particular, suicide rate has been carefully recorded. Compliance with the regimen had been high. At the end of December 1992, there had been 2 suicides in the group--one of the patients had discontinued taking lithium some months before the suicide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Coppen A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/mortality/prevention & control\r\nDepressive Disorder/mortality/*prevention & control\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/therapeutic use\r\nPlacebos\r\nProspective Studies\r\nPsychotic Disorders/mortality/prevention & control\r\nRecurrence\r\nSuicide/statistics & numerical data\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Coppen A (1994) Depression as a lethal disease: prevention strategies..

It has also been shown that mood disorders carry an increased risk of suicide and that a significant proportion of individuals who commit suicide suffer from a mood disorder. This paper reports the results of a long term follow-up of a cohort of patients attending a specialist mood disorder clinic over a period of 18 years. Sixty-seven suffered from unipolar depression and 36 had bipolar or schizo-affective disorders In order to qualify for entry to the cohort the unipolar patients had to have had at least three episodes of depression and those with bipolar disorders had to have had at least three episodes - with at least one manic episode and one depressive episode. All patients were treated with lithium. The initial treatment refusal rate and drop our rates were low. The mortality from suicide in this group was compared with that reported in five recent studies - all of which involved patients who had not been given maintenance therapy. The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) for all causes for the whole group was 0.93. There were two suicides. In one case the patient had continued treatment with lithium until death and in the other the patient had discontinued treatment 12 months before death. The overall suicide rate was 1.3 per 1000 patient years. Amongst similar groups of patients who had not been given maintenance therapy suicide rates of about 5.5 per 1000 patient years have been reported. It is concluded that maintenance treatment of mood disorders reduces the suicide rate in this vulnerable group of patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Coppen A ; Farmer R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0165-0327(98)00067-6 ","Keywords":"Cohort Studies\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIncidence\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMood Disorders/*drug therapy/mortality\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSuicide/*statistics & numerical data","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Coppen A, and Farmer R (1998) Suicide mortality in patients on lithium maintenance therapy..

Numerous double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have shown that lithium is very effective at reducing relapses when given as maintenance therapy. It is also very effective when given as maintenance therapy after electroconvulsive therapy. It can be given once a day at night, and controlled trials have shown a 12-hour plasma lithium level between 0.5 and 0.7 mmol/L the most effective, with very slight side effects. Long-term studies of lithium maintenance therapy show a suicide rate of 1.3 suicides per 1000 patient years. This is much lower than comparative studies in long-term follow-up of untreated depression, which show about 5.5 suicides per 1000 patient years. Although it is neither feasible nor ethical to carry out double-blind studies on suicide reduction, the massive evidence showing a reduction in morbidity on lithium treatment suggests that systematic long-term lithium treatment of unipolar depression could considerably lower the suicide rate.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Coppen A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepressive Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/administration & dosage/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPlacebos\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales/statistics & numerical data\r\nPsychotic Disorders/drug therapy\r\nSuicide/statistics & numerical data\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\n*Suicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Coppen A (2000) Lithium in unipolar depression and the prevention of suicide..

Like other drugs used in the treatment of psychiatric diseases, it has little effect on the mood of healthy individuals. Our previous studies found that mice with a mutation in the Clock gene (ClockΔ19) have a complete behavioral profile that is very similar to human mania, which can be reversed with chronic lithium treatment. However, the cellular and physiological effects that underlie its targeted therapeutic efficacy remain unknown. Here we find that ClockΔ19 mice have an increase in dopaminergic activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and that lithium treatment selectively reduces the firing rate in the mutant mice with no effect on activity in wild-type mice. Furthermore, lithium treatment reduces nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine levels selectively in the mutant mice. The increased dopaminergic activity in the Clock mutants is associated with cell volume changes in dopamine neurons, which are also rescued by lithium treatment. To determine the role of dopaminergic activity and morphological changes in dopamine neurons in manic-like behavior, we manipulated the excitability of these neurons by overexpressing an inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit (Kir2.1) selectively in the VTA of ClockΔ19 mice and wild-type mice using viral-mediated gene transfer. Introduction of this channel mimics the effects of lithium treatment on the firing rate of dopamine neurons in ClockΔ19 mice and leads to a similar change in dopamine cell volume. Furthermore, reduction of dopaminergic firing rates in ClockΔ19 animals results in a normalization of locomotor- and anxiety-related behavior that is very similar to lithium treatment; however, it is not sufficient to reverse depression-related behavior. These results suggest that abnormalities in dopamine cell firing and associated morphology underlie alterations in anxiety-related behavior in bipolar mania, and that the therapeutic effects of lithium come from a reversal of these abnormal phenotypes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Coque L ; Mukherjee S ; Cao JL ; Spencer S ; Marvin M ; Falcon E ; Sidor MM ; Birnbaum SG ; Graham A ; Neve RL ; Gordon E ; Ozburn AR ; Goldberg MS ; Han MH ; Cooper DC ; McClung CA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/npp.2011.33 ","Keywords":"Action Potentials/drug effects/*genetics\r\nAnalysis of Variance\r\nAnimals\r\nAnxiety/genetics\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology/physiopathology\r\nCLOCK Proteins/*genetics\r\nCell Count\r\nChromatography, High Pressure Liquid\r\nDark Adaptation/drug effects/genetics\r\nDepression/genetics\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDopamine/*metabolism\r\nGreen Fluorescent Proteins/genetics\r\nHelplessness, Learned\r\nHistones/metabolism\r\nIn Vitro Techniques\r\nLithium Chloride/therapeutic use\r\nLocomotion/drug effects/genetics\r\nMale\r\nMaze Learning/drug effects\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred BALB C\r\nMice, Knockout\r\nMutation/*genetics\r\nNeurons/drug effects/*physiology\r\nPatch-Clamp Techniques\r\nSwimming/psychology\r\nTyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/metabolism\r\nVentral Tegmental Area/*pathology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Coque L, Mukherjee S, Cao JL, Spencer S, Marvin M, Falcon E, Sidor MM, Birnbaum SG, Graham A, Neve RL, Gordon E, Ozburn AR, Goldberg MS, Han MH, Cooper DC, and McClung CA (2011) Specific role of VTA dopamine neuronal firing rates and morphology in the reversal of anxiety-related, but not depression-related behavior in the ClockΔ19 mouse model of mania..

The lack of a successful treatment represents one of the main challenges of this disorder. The therapeutic value of lithium in RBD has been suggested by Montgomery, but the specific efficacy of this agent has not been tested yet in the case of patients with recurrent brief depressive disorder. METHODS: We report on a 38-year-old man who presented a 10-month history of sudden depressive episodes, with monthly recurrences lasting 2-4 days, prior to our first assessment. RESULTS: The patient was treated with clomipramine, with complete remission of the depressive episode after three days. Nevertheless, in spite of maintaining the treatment, he presented a new episode one month later and two episodes the month after. Since then, lithium therapy was added and during the last 13 months he has remained euthymic, without any recurrence of depressive symptoms. Lithium treatment has been maintained and clomipramine treatment was gradually tapered because of the complaints of impotence, dry mouth, and dizziness. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of recurrences since lithium treatment was started (during the last 13 months, and especially during the last 10 months, where lithium has been the only treatment), suggests a prophylactic effect of this agent on RBD. Lithium's mechanism of action in preventing depressive recurrences might play a major role in the therapeutic approach of RBD, especially since recurrence (but not the duration of the symptoms) is the main feature that defines the severity of this disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Corominas A ; Bonet P ; Nieto E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0006-3223(97)00538-6 ","Keywords":"Acute Disease\r\nAdult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/diagnosis/*drug therapy/prevention & control\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nSecondary Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Corominas A, Bonet P, and Nieto E (1998) Recurrent brief depression successfully treated with lithium..

Of this 3%, bipolar disease affects largely women (∼ 3 : 2 compared with men). The median age of diagnosis is 25 in women and even lower in men. A diagnosis of bipolar disease is an expensive psychiatric diagnosis, costing patients more than twice as much money as a diagnosis of unipolar depression. Bipolar I is characterized by one or more manic or mixed episodes, with both mania and depression occurring each day for at least 1 week, whereas bipolar II is characterized by one or more major depressive episode and at least one episode of hypomania. Bipolar I is the more severe diagnosis. A wide range of medications are available to help patients maintain a healthy lifestyle, including lithium, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. Improved methods for identifying bipolar disease, including a more structured approach and a more complete use of medical records, have increased the rate of diagnosis, especially in children, which underscores the need for innovation in development and in practice of new treatment options for treating bipolar disease. Although lithium has been the 'gold standard' for treating bipolar disorder for decades, new research into other forms of treatment has shown anticonvulsants to be a particularly useful therapy for treating bipolar disease. Anticonvulsants have remarkable mood-stabilization abilities and they do not lead to serious side effects, which increases the tolerability, and consequently, patient adherence to this form of treatment. Recent studies have shown that anticonvulsants improve behavior in bipolar disease by modulating the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses through a number of complementary molecular cascades that affect gene expression and cell survival.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Corrado AC ; Walsh JP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/WNR.0000000000000510 ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*pharmacology\r\nAntimanic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/adverse effects/*pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Corrado AC, and Walsh JP (2016) Mechanisms underlying the benefits of anticonvulsants over lithium in the treatment of bipolar disorder..

Optimal management of pediatric bipolar depression is often defined by its multimodal nature with emphasis on both psychopharmacological and psychosocial treatment. This article provides a brief overview of the epidemiology and clinical course of pediatric bipolar depression, a clinically-oriented guide to the evidence-based psychopharmacological and psychosocial management of bipolar depression in youth, and suggestions on how best to integrate medication and therapy. Recommended treatment for bipolar depression in pediatric populations usually includes both medication and psychosocial interventions given a paucity of double-blind, placebo-controlled psychopharmacological studies. Lithium and lamotrigine are feasible and tentatively efficacious options; however, treatment with quetiapine monotherapy may be no better than placebo. Furthermore, some youth may be at heightened risk for developing manic symptoms after treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Psychotherapy, either alone or adjunctively with medications, provides practitioners with a safe and feasible alternative. Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy for Adolescents (IPSRT-A), Child- and Family-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CFF-CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Adolescents (DBT-A), family psychoeducation, and Family Focused Therapy for Adolescents (FFT-A) are evidence-based treatments available to clinicians treating youth with bipolar depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cosgrove VE ; Roybal D ; Chang KD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s40272-013-0022-8 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/epidemiology/therapy\r\nChild\r\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\r\nFamily Therapy\r\nHumans\r\n*Psychotherapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cosgrove VE, Roybal D, and Chang KD (2013) Bipolar depression in pediatric populations : epidemiology and management..

We studied whether combination therapy is more effective than monotherapy for the acute treatment of subjects with bipolar I disorder currently experiencing manic symptoms. The primary hypothesis was that combination treatments would be associated with greater reductions in symptoms of mania and hypomania than monotherapy alone. The secondary hypothesis was that combination therapies would be associated with lower depression levels than monotherapy alone. Last, a post-hoc exploratory aim was used to examine whether the effect of side effect severity on risk-of-dropout would be greater in combination therapies than in monotherapy alone. RESULTS: In this 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled ambulatory pilot trial, participants (n = 75) with bipolar I disorder were randomly assigned to: (1) monotherapy divalproex plus placebo (DVP + PBO), (2) combination therapy of divalproex plus blinded lithium (DVP + Li) or (3) divalproex plus blinded quetiapine (DVP + QTP). Combination therapies (vs. monotherapy) were not associated with improved symptoms of mania, hypomania or depression. The effect of side effect severity on study retention did not differ between combination therapies and monotherapy. However, the risk-of-dropout was significantly greater in the DVP + Li arm versus the DVP + PBO arm. CONCLUSIONS: No longitudinal differences in mania, hypomania or depression were found between combination therapies and monotherapy. The effect of side effect severity on study retention did not differ between groups.

Glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK-3β), a kinase known for its activity on glycogen synthesis, has in the last few years raised growing interest in biological psychiatry. Several efficient treatments in major depression have an inhibitory effect on this kinase, which could be targeted in new mood disorder treatments. METHODS: The aim of this review is to summarize findings concerning the intracellular pharmacologic effects of GSK-3β inhibitors on mood. After a brief description of the intracellular transduction pathways implicated in both GSK-3β and mood disorders, we reviewed the results demonstrating GSK-3β involvement in the effects of lithium and ketamine. RESULTS: GSK-3β can be inhibited through several mechanisms such as serine phosphorylation or binding in a proteic scaffold and others. Its inhibition is implicated in numerous cellular pathways of interest involved in neuronal growth and architecture, cell survival, neurogenesis or synaptic plasticity. This inhibition appears to be both efficient and sufficient in improving mood in animal models. In human beings, several levels of evidence show GSK-3β inhibition with antidepressant use. Crucially, strong inhibition has been shown with lithium via the proteic scaffold PP2A/β-arrestin/AKT, and with the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine via p70S6K. CONCLUSION: Our review focuses on mechanisms whereby the GSK-3β pathway has a part in the antidepressant effect of lithium and ketamine. This article highlights the importance of translational research from cell and animal models to the clinical setting in order to develop innovative therapeutic targets.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Costemale-Lacoste JF ; Guilloux JP ; Gaillard R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.encep.2016.02.003 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*drug therapy/enzymology\r\nEnzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors\r\nHumans\r\nKetamine/*pharmacology\r\nLithium/*pharmacology\r\nMood Disorders/drug therapy/enzymology\r\nDépression résistante au traitement\r\nGSK-3\r\nKetamine\r\nKétamine\r\nLithium\r\nTreatment-resistant depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Costemale-Lacoste JF, Guilloux JP, and Gaillard R (2016) The role of GSK-3 in treatment-resistant depression and links with the pharmacological effects of lithium and ketamine: A review of the literature..

English-language articles, review articles and original research articles were reviewed. Most data are available for the \"mood stabilizers\" lithium and valproate. However, these agents have important limitations regarding their tolerability and efficacy in certain groups. Newer anticonvulsants, especially lamotrigine, have demonstrated efficacy across mood-symptom domains. Antidepressants are not generally favoured as monotherapy in patients with bipolar depression or schizoaffective disorder, due to their potential to induce switching to manic states. However, data are emerging for the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for bipolar depression in combination with atypical antipsychotics. Atypical antipsychotics may also be used as monotherapy or in conjunction with mood stabilizers for the treatment of acute mania and for continuing maintenance therapy. The choice of antipsychotic may be influenced by the therapeutic situation; formulations that facilitate administration in the acute scenario can provide rapid tranquillization, whereas those that enhance compliance may have a place in maintenance therapy.

The striking antidepressant effect of ketamine in resistant depression has stimulated research into glutamatergic compounds; however, capturing the efficacy of ketamine with drugs suitable for continuous use has proved challenging. Growing knowledge of the pathophysiological role of inflammation in depression offers great opportunities for future treatment in terms of repurposing anti-inflammatory agents from general medicine and pre-treatment stratification of those depressed patients in whom such interventions are likely to be beneficial.

Lithium may be a better treatment choice in patients with: positive family history for bipolar disorder, mania-depression-interval pattern, few previous affective episodes/hospitalizations, high risk for suicide, no comorbidities. Valproate may be more effective as antimanic rather than prophylactic agent. Valproate might be a better choice in patients with many previous affective episodes/hospitalizations and psychiatric comorbidities.

Among the strategies to overcome both dilemmas, the additional treatment with lithium has been suggested as a viable method. The authors determined in 2 separate meta-analyses the efficacy of lithium in accelerating and in augmenting clinical response in patients with depression. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA SOURCES: Two meta-analyses of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials including subjects with unipolar or bipolar disorder, depressive phase, assessed the concomitant administration of lithium and antidepressant to accelerate or augment clinical response in the acute treatment phase of depression. Data were obtained from searching the following databases: MEDLINE (1966 to July 2006), EMBASE (1989 to July 2006), and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 3). For the accelerating meta-analysis, subject headings including depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, antidepressive agents, and lithium and text words such as depress*, lithium, and antidepress* were used. For the augmentation meta-analysis, subject headings included depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anti-depressive agents, lithium, drug therapy, and combination, and text words included augment*, refract*, and resistant. Outcomes investigated included response rates and depression scale rates. DATA SYNTHESIS: Five acceleration studies (231 participants) adding lithium to tricyclics and tetracyclics and 10 augmentation studies (269 participants) adding lithium to various antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were incorporated. In the acceleration meta-analysis, a statistical trend in favor of lithium was found (standardized mean difference of -0.43, 95% CI = -0.93 to 0.07). In the augmentation meta-analysis, lithium was significantly more effective than placebo (odds ratio = 3.11, 95% CI = 1.80 to 5.37). CONCLUSION: There is firm evidence for lithium as an effective augmentation strategy but only modest evidence for lithium to accelerate response to antidepressants in patients with depressive disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Crossley NA ; Bauer M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/jcp.v68n0617 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Interactions\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Crossley NA, and Bauer M (2007) Acceleration and augmentation of antidepressants with lithium for depressive disorders: two meta-analyses of randomized, placebo-controlled trials..

However, no studies have identified the impact of iron in RLS patients on sleep, depression, fatigue, or quality of life (QoL). OBJECTIVE: The aims of this secondary data analysis was to determine relationships (a) between serum iron with RLS symptom severity, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, depression, fatigue, and quality of life (QoL); and (b) based on demographics, specifically age and ethnicity. METHOD: Data were collected on iron and ferritin concentrations in 48 persons with RLS. RESULTS: Low serum iron levels were measured in 32% of the participants with only 1 person (4%) treated with iron supplementation. General linear models identified age and race as covariants: (a) being White (p = .047) and higher iron levels (p = .019) were independent predictors of higher social functioning; (b) being White (p = .047) and higher iron levels (p = .004) were independent predictors of less sleepiness; (c) younger age (p = .001) and lower iron levels (p = .025) were independent predictors of depression; and (d) younger age (p = .006) and lower iron levels (p = .005) were independent predictors of fatigue. DISCUSSION: Findings from this study show that iron supplementation for persons with RLS not only improves motor and sensory symptoms but might also improve sleep, sleepiness, depression, fatigue, and QoL and should be considered by health care providers for treatment of RLS.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cuellar NG ; Hanlon A ; Ratcliffe SJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/1054773810388557 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nIron/blood\r\nQuality of Life\r\nRestless Legs Syndrome/*physiopathology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cuellar NG, Hanlon A, and Ratcliffe SJ (2011) The relationship with iron and health outcomes in persons with restless legs syndrome..

In this study, zinc chloride (ZnCl2) was given alone or in combination with different classes of antidepressants by oral route (p.o.) to mice and the behavioral response in the tail suspension test (TST), a predictive test of antidepressant action, was investigated. ZnCl2 at a dose of 10 and 30 mg/kg, p.o., reduced the immobility time in the TST, without affecting the locomotor activity in open-field test. The antidepressants fluoxetine, paroxetine, imipramine, desipramine and bupropion produced a significant reduction in the immobility time in TST at the doses of 10, 1, 1, 1 and 10 mg/kg, p.o., respectively. The combined treatment of sub-effective doses of ZnCl2 (1 mg/kg) with sub-effective doses of fluoxetine (5 mg/kg), paroxetine (0.1 mg/kg), desipramine (0.1 mg/kg), imipramine (0.1 mg/kg) or bupropion (1 mg/kg) induced a significant reduction in the immobility time in the TST when compared with the groups treated with ZnCl2 or with antidepressants alone. The treatment with sub-effective doses of ZnCl2 and antidepressants alone or in combination did not affect the locomotion in open-field test, except that desipramine alone reduced the ambulation. The results first indicate that ZnCl2 administered by p.o. route produces an antidepressant-like effect in the TST. Moreover, synergistic effects of zinc with antidepressants were shown in the TST, suggesting that an improvement in the response to the antidepressant therapy occurs when zinc is combined with different classes of antidepressants.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cunha MP ; Machado DG ; Bettio LE ; Capra JC ; Rodrigues AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2008.09.006 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nChlorides/*pharmacology\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nExploratory Behavior/drug effects\r\nHindlimb Suspension/*methods\r\nImmobility Response, Tonic/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nZinc Compounds/*pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cunha MP, Machado DG, Bettio LE, Capra JC, and Rodrigues AL (2008) Interaction of zinc with antidepressants in the tail suspension test..

When first-line antidepressant treatment is unsuccessful, second-line strategies include dose optimisation, switching to another antidepressant, combination with another antidepressant, or augmentation with a non-antidepressant medication. Much of the evidence for the efficacy of augmentation strategies comes from studies using lithium to augment the effects of tricyclic antidepressants. The neural circuitry underlying the therapeutic effects of lithium augmentation is not yet fully understood. Recently, we reported that chronic treatment with a combination of lithium and the antidepressant desipramine, exerted antidepressant-like behavioural effects in a mouse strain (BALB/cOLaHsd) that did not exhibit an antidepressant-like behavioural response to either drug alone. In the present study, we used this model in combination with ΔFosB/FosB immunohistochemistry to identify brain regions chronically affected by lithium augmentation of desipramine when compared to either treatment alone. The data suggest that the dorsal raphe nucleus and the CA3 regions of the dorsal hippocampus are key nodes in the neural circuitry underlying antidepressant action of lithium augmentation of desipramine. These data give new insight into the neurobiology underlying the mechanism of lithium augmentation in the context of treatment-resistant depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cussotto S ; Cryan JF ; O'Leary OF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neulet.2017.03.040 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/*administration & dosage\r\nBrain/drug effects/metabolism\r\nCell Count\r\nDesipramine/*administration & dosage\r\nDorsal Raphe Nucleus/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nHippocampus/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nLithium/*administration & dosage\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred BALB C\r\nProto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/metabolism\r\nAntidepressant\r\nDepression\r\nDesipramine\r\nFosB\r\nLithium\r\nΔFosB","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cussotto S, Cryan JF, and O'Leary OF (2017) The hippocampus and dorsal raphe nucleus are key brain areas associated with the antidepressant effects of lithium augmentation of desipramine..

The role of zinc supplementation in the prevention and treatment of depression has been suggested in clinical studies that reported a reduction in depressive symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to determine whether zinc supplementation vs placebo can prevent or improve depressive symptoms in children, adolescents, or adults. DATA SOURCES: Five electronic databases were searched, and studies published until September 2019 were included without language restriction. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, controlled, crossover trials that evaluated the effect of zinc supplementation vs a comparator for prevention or improvement of depressive symptoms in children, adolescents, or adults were eligible for inclusion. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently performed data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment. RESULTS: The initial search identified 12 322 studies, 5 of which were eligible for meta-analysis. The standardized mean difference (SMD) showed an average reduction of 0.36 point (95%CI, -0.67 to -0.04) in the intervention group compared with the placebo group. Forstudies in which the mean age of participants was ≥ 40 years, the SMD was reduced by 0.61 point (95%CI, -1.12 to -0.09) in the intervention group vs the placebo group. The meta-analysis by sample size (< 60 individuals and ≥ 60 individuals) did not show an effect of zinc supplementation in reducing depressive symptoms (SMD -0.28; 95%CI, -0.67 to -0.10; and SMD -0.52; 95%CI, -1.10 to 0.06).

OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Our aim was to extend information about the antidepressant-like action of SeBZF1 using the mouse tail suspension test (TST). Initial experiments investigated the mechanisms involved in the acute antidepressant-like action of SeBZF1 in male Swiss mice. For this purpose, males received noradrenergic or dopaminergic receptor antagonists before acute SeBZF1 administration (50 mg/kg, per oral). In parallel, effects of combined treatment with SeBZF1 and bupropion at sub-effective doses (1 and 3 mg/kg, respectively) were tested. The next experiments were designed to determine the acute effects of SeBZF1 in females through a dose-response curve (5-50 mg/kg). Lastly, the efficacy of a 7-day repeated treatment with SeBZF1 (1 and 5 mg/kg) in mice of both sexes and its safety were evaluated. TST and the open-field test (OFT) were employed in all behavioral experiments. RESULTS: Pre-administration of dopaminergic antagonists (SCH23390, a selective D(1)R antagonist; sulpiride, a selective D(2)/D(3)R antagonist; and haloperidol, a non-selective antagonist), but not of adrenergic α(1), α(2), and β-R antagonists, blocked the acute antidepressant-like effects of SeBZF1 in males. Co-administration of sub-effective doses of SeBZF1 and bupropion reduced the depressive phenotype. In addition, acute treatment with SeBZF1 at 50 mg/kg produced a reduction of female immobility. Finally, repeated treatment with SeBZF1 (1 and 5 mg/kg) was effective in causing antidepressant-like effects in both sexes. Locomotor activity, plasma transaminases, and urea levels remained unaltered after SeBZF1 exposure. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence of the involvement of the dopaminergic system in the acutely antidepressant-like action of SeBZF1 in male mice and reveal the compound efficacy when acute or repeatedly administered in both sexes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"da Silva Teixeira Rech T; Gonçalves Alves A; Nornberg Strelow D; Devantier Krüger L; Carraro Júnior LR; Dos Santos Neto JS; Braga AL ; Brüning CA ; Folharini Bortolatto C; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00213-021-05921-9 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Antidepressive Agents/pharmacology\r\n*Benzofurans/pharmacology\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nDopamine\r\nDopamine Antagonists\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nFemale\r\nHindlimb Suspension\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nSwimming\r\nBenzofuran\r\nDepression\r\nDopaminergic system\r\nSeBZF1\r\nSelenium","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"da Silva Teixeira Rech T, Gonçalves Alves A, Nornberg Strelow D, Devantier Krüger L, Carraro Júnior LR, Dos Santos Neto JS, Braga AL, Brüning CA, and Folharini Bortolatto C (2021) 2-Phenyl-3-(phenylselanyl)benzofuran elicits acute antidepressant-like action in male Swiss mice mediated by modulation of the dopaminergic system and reveals therapeutic efficacy in both sexes..

Only 2 of the 6 pharmacological treatments proved significantly superior to a placebo- a study of lithium with depression and flupenthixol with personality disorders. Eight out of 16 psychological treatments proved superior to treatment as usual or another approach: cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) (n = 4), (including dialectical behaviour therapy [n = 2]); psychodynamic therapy (n = 2); mixed (CBT plus psychodynamic therapy [n = 1]); and motivational approach and change in therapist (n = 1). Among the 8 studies using visit, postal, or telephone contact or green-token emergency card provision, 2 were significant: one involving telephone follow-up and the other telephone follow-up or visits. Hospitalization was not related to fewer attempts, and 1 of the 4 outreach approaches had significant results: a program involving individualized biweekly treatment. The rationale behind these single or multiple approaches still needs to be clarified. There were methodological flaws in many studies and some had very specific limited samples. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for more research addressing the problem in definitions of outcomes and measurement of the dependent variables, gender-specific effects, and inclusion of high-risk groups. There is a need for the development and evaluation of new approaches that support collaboration with community resources and more careful assessment and comparisons of existing treatments with different populations.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Daigle MS ; Pouliot L ; Chagnon F ; Greenfield B ; Mishara B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/070674371105601008 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nMental Health Services\r\nPsychotherapy\r\nSecondary Prevention\r\nSuicide, Attempted/*prevention & control/psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Daigle MS, Pouliot L, Chagnon F, Greenfield B, and Mishara B (2011) Suicide attempts: prevention of repetition..

The history of the illness differs widely between patients, with episode frequency emerging as a strong predictor of poor illness outcome. Lithium salts are the first-choice long-term mood-stabilizing therapy, but not all patients respond equally to the treatment. Evidence suggests that alterations in glutamatergic systems may contribute to the pathophysiology of depression. Moreover, glutamate signaling is involved in brain development and synaptic plasticity, both of which are modified in individuals affected by BD, and has been implicated in the etiology of the disorder. The inactivation of glutamate is handled by a series of molecular glutamate transporters (excitatory amino acid transporters [EAATs]), among which EAAT2/SLC1A2 is responsible for up to 95% of extracellular glutamate clearance. A functional single-nucleotide polymorphism at -181 bp from the transcription start site of the SLC1A2 gene has been described. This T-to-G (DNA forward strand) polymorphism, commonly known as SLC1A2 -181A>C, affects transporter expression, with the variant G allele inducing a 30% reduction in promoter activity compared with the T allele. OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study were to investigate if factors affecting glutamate function, such as SLC1A2 -181A>C (rs4354668), could affect recurrence of illness in BD, and if they interact with lithium salt treatment. METHODS: We performed an observational study in our university hospital in Milan. We enrolled 110 subjects (76 females, 34 males) affected by BD type I. The exclusion criteria were other diagnoses on Axis I, mental retardation on Axis II, a history of epilepsy, and major medical and neurologic disorders. Fifty-four patients had been treated with lithium salts for more than 6 months. Patients were genotyped for SLC1A2 -181A>C by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, and the influence of genotype on BD episode recurrence rates, and the interaction between the single nucleotide polymorphism and lithium treatment, were analyzed. RESULTS: The SLC1A2 -181A>C genotype significantly influenced the total recurrence of episodes, with T/T homozygotes showing a significantly lower frequency of episodes (F = 3.26; p = 0.042), and an interaction between lithium treatment and genotype (F = 3.77; p = 0.026) was found to influence the history of the illness. CONCLUSION: According to our results, the glutamatergic system could be hypothesized to exert some influence on the history of illness in BD. The SLC1A2 functional polymorphism was shown to significantly influence the total episode recurrence rate, with wild-type T homozygotes presenting the lowest number of episodes, G homozygotes reporting the highest number, and heterozygotes showing an intermediate phenotype. We confirmed the efficacy of lithium treatment in reducing the recurrence of illness in BD, and we found an interaction between lithium treatment and the SLC1A2 -181A>C genotype, confirming previous studies reporting an interaction between lithium salts and the glutamatergic system.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dallaspezia S ; Poletti S ; Lorenzi C ; Pirovano A ; Colombo C ; Benedetti F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s40291-012-0004-5 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAlleles\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/genetics\r\nExcitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2\r\nFemale\r\nGene-Environment Interaction\r\nGlutamate Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics/metabolism\r\nHomozygote\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide\r\nRecurrence\r\nWhite People","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dallaspezia S, Poletti S, Lorenzi C, Pirovano A, Colombo C, and Benedetti F (2012) Influence of an interaction between lithium salts and a functional polymorphism in SLC1A2 on the history of illness in bipolar disorder..

Male C57BL/6J mice received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of saline solution (NaCl 0.09%, 1 ml/kg), Li (47.3 mg/kg, 1 ml/kg) or VPA (200 mg/kg, 1 ml/kg) once a day for seven days.

Animals were submitted to 36 h of PSD, and then, they were submitted to the open field test. The frontal cortex and hippocampus were dissected from the brain. The manic-like behaviors in the mice were analyzed. Treatment with Li and VPA reversed the behavioral alterations induced by PSD. PSD decreased BDNF, NGF, and GDNF levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of mice. The administration of Li and VPA protected the brain against the damage induced by PSD. However, PSD and the administration of Li and VPA did not affect the levels of NT-3 and NT-4 in either brain structure evaluated. In conclusion, the PSD protocol induced manic-like behavior in rats and induced alterations in neurotrophic factor levels. It seems that neurotrophic factors and sleep are essential targets to treat BD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dal-Pont GC ; Jório MTS ; Resende WR ; Gava FF ; Aguiar-Geraldo JM ; Possamai-Della T ; Peper-Nascimento J ; Quevedo J ; Valvassori SS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2019.09.003 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntimanic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/drug effects\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFrontal Lobe/*drug effects\r\nGlial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/drug effects\r\nHippocampus/*drug effects\r\nLithium Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nNerve Growth Factor/drug effects\r\nNerve Growth Factors/*drug effects\r\nSleep Deprivation/*complications\r\nSleep, REM/physiology\r\nValproic Acid/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nDepression\r\nLithium\r\nNeurotrophic factors\r\nParadoxical sleep deprivation\r\nValproate","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dal-Pont GC, Jório MTS, Resende WR, Gava FF, Aguiar-Geraldo JM, Possamai-Della T, Peper-Nascimento J, Quevedo J, and Valvassori SS (2019) Effects of lithium and valproate on behavioral parameters and neurotrophic factor levels in an animal model of mania induced by paradoxical sleep deprivation..

We examined the effect of lithium carbonate addition in 39 patients with unipolar depression whose conditions were not improved by at least three weeks' TCA drug administration. In 30 of 42 observations, lithium carbonate brought about a greater than 50% improvement within 48 hours. In a second study, the effects of lithium carbonate addition were compared in five amitriptyline hydrochloride-pretreated and five placebo-pretreated patients who showed no improvement after a three-week treatment. All five patients receiving amitriptyline showed a greater than 50% improvement 48 hours after lithium carbonate addition, whereas only one patient in the placebo group showed a marked response. In a third study the effect of lithium carbonate withdrawal was studied in nine TCA-resistant patients who had shown a marked improvement 48 hours after lithium addition. Only five of these patients had a relapse five days after lithium discontinuation. Since animal studies have shown that TCA drugs sensitize forebrain neurons to serotonin and that lithium enhances the activity of serotonin-containing neurons, we propose that the antidepressant effect of lithium addition in TCA-resistant patients might be mediated by enhancing serotonin neurotransmission.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"de Montigny C ; Cournoyer G ; Morissette R ; Langlois R ; Caillé G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1001/archpsyc.1983.01790110069012 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAmitriptyline/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDesipramine/therapeutic use\r\nDoxepin/therapeutic use\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nImipramine/therapeutic use\r\nLithium/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nLithium Carbonate\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNeurons/drug effects\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSerotonin/physiology\r\nTrimipramine/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"de Montigny C, Cournoyer G, Morissette R, Langlois R, and Caillé G (1983) Lithium carbonate addition in tricyclic antidepressant-resistant unipolar depression.

There have now been a substantial number of studies of lithium augmentation in non-responding depressed patients and a positive effect is consistently reported.

OBJECTIVES: The pharmacological activity of 4-PSQ in depressive-like behavior associated with memory impairment induced by acute restraint stress (ARS) in male Swiss mice was evaluated. METHODS: ARS is an unavoidable stress model that was applied for a period of 240 min. Ten minutes after ARS, animals were intragastrically treated with canola oil (10 ml/kg) or 4-PSQ (10 mg/kg) or positive controls (paroxetine or donepezil) (10 mg/kg). Then, after 30 min, mice were submitted to behavioral tests. Corticosterone levels were evaluated in plasma and oxidative stress parameters; monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A and MAO -B isoform activity; mRNA expression levels of kappa nuclear factor B (NF-κB); interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, and IL-33; phosphatidylinositol-se-kinase (PI3K); protein kinase B (AKT2), as well as acetylcholinesterase activity were evaluated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. RESULTS: 4-PSQ attenuated the depressive-like behavior, self-care, and memory impairment caused by ARS. Based on the evidence, we believe that effects of 4-PSQ may be associated, at least in part, with the attenuation of HPA axis activation, attenuation of alterations in the monoaminergic system, modulation of oxidative stress, reestablishment of AChE activity, modulation of the PI3K/AKT2 pathway, and reduction of neuroinflammation. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that 4-PSQ exhibited an antidepressant-like effect and attenuated the memory impairment induced by ARS, and it is a promising molecule to treat these comorbidities.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"de Oliveira RL ; Voss GT ; da C Rodrigues K; Pinz MP ; Biondi JV ; Becker NP ; Blodorn E ; Domingues WB ; Larroza A ; Campos VF ; Alves D ; Wilhelm EA ; Luchese C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00213-021-06039-8 ","Keywords":"Acetylcholinesterase/metabolism\r\nAnimals\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nHippocampus/metabolism\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nNeuroinflammatory Diseases\r\nOxidative Stress\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System/metabolism\r\n*Quinolines/pharmacology\r\n*Selenium\r\nAcute restraint stress\r\nAlzheimer’s disease\r\nCentral nervous system\r\nCorticosterone\r\nNeuroinflammation\r\nNeuroplasticity\r\nOxidative stress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"de Oliveira RL, Voss GT, da C Rodrigues K, Pinz MP, Biondi JV, Becker NP, Blodorn E, Domingues WB, Larroza A, Campos VF, Alves D, Wilhelm EA, and Luchese C (2022) Prospecting for a quinoline containing selenium for comorbidities depression and memory impairment induced by restriction stress in mice..

However, no study has evaluated OxS parameters in unmedicated early stage BD and their association with lithium treatment in bipolar depression. METHODS: Patients with BD I or II (n = 29) in a depressive episode were treated for 6 weeks with lithium. Plasma samples were collected at baseline and endpoint, and were also compared to age-matched controls (n = 28). The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were measured. RESULTS: Subjects with BD depression at baseline presented a significant increase in CAT (p = 0.005) and GPx (p < 0.001) levels, with lower SOD/CAT ratio (p = 0.001) and no changes on SOD or TBARS compared to healthy controls. Regarding therapeutics, lithium only induced a decrease in TBARS (p = 0.023) and SOD (p = 0.029) levels, especially in BDII. Finally, TBARS levels were significantly lower at endpoint in lithium responders compared to non-responders (p = 0.018) with no difference in any biomarker regarding remission. CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest a reactive increase in antioxidant enzymes levels during depressive episodes in early stage BD with minimal prior treatment. Also, decreased lipid peroxidation (TBARS) levels were observed, associated with lithium's clinical efficacy. Overall, these results reinforce the role for altered oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of BD and the presence of antioxidant effects of lithium in the prevention of illness progression and clinical efficacy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"de Sousa RT ; Zarate CA Jr; Zanetti MV ; Costa AC ; Talib LL ; Gattaz WF ; Machado-Vieira R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2013.11.011 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism\r\nCatalase/blood\r\nDepression\r\nFemale\r\nGlutathione Peroxidase/blood\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\n*Oxidative Stress\r\nSuperoxide Dismutase/blood\r\nThiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances/analysis\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nBipolar Disorder\r\nDepression\r\nLithium\r\nNeuroprotection\r\nOxidative stress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"de Sousa RT, Zarate CA Jr, Zanetti MV, Costa AC, Talib LL, Gattaz WF, and Machado-Vieira R (2014) Oxidative stress in early stage Bipolar Disorder and the association with response to lithium..

GSK3β is also an important target for lithium and antidepressants. When phosphorylated at serine-9, GSK3β becomes inactive. Few studies evaluated serine-9 phosphorylated GSK3β (phospho-GSK3β) levels in BD subjects in vivo and no study has assessed it specifically in bipolar depression. Also, the effect of lithium monotherapy on GSK3β has never been studied in humans. METHODS: In 27 patients with bipolar depression, total GSK3β and phospho-GSK3β were assessed in platelets by enzyme immunometric assay. Subjects were evaluated before and after 6 weeks of lithium treatment at therapeutic levels. Healthy subjects (n = 22) were used as a control group. RESULTS: No differences in phospho-GSK3β or total GSK3β were observed when comparing drug-free BD subjects in depression and healthy controls. Baseline HAM-D scores were not correlated with phospho-GSK3β and total GSK3β levels. From baseline to endpoint, lithium treatment inactivated GSK3β by significantly increasing phospho-GSK3β levels (p = 0.010). Clinical improvement (baseline HAM-D - endpoint HAM-D) negatively correlated with the increase in phospho-GSK3β (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The present results show that lithium inactivates platelet GSK3β in BD during mood episodes. No direct association with pathophysiology of BD was observed. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of GSK3β as a key biomarker in BD and its association with treatment response as well as the relevance of GSK3β in other neuropsychiatric disorders and as a new therapeutic target per se.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"de Sousa RT ; Zanetti MV ; Talib LL ; Serpa MH ; Chaim TM ; Carvalho AF ; Brunoni AR ; Busatto GF ; Gattaz WF ; Machado-Vieira R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2015.01.016 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*blood/*drug therapy\r\nBlood Platelets/*drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*metabolism\r\nGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nPhosphorylation\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nStatistics as Topic\r\nYoung Adult\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nDepression\r\nGSK3\r\nLithium\r\nNeurobiology\r\nTreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"de Sousa RT, Zanetti MV, Talib LL, Serpa MH, Chaim TM, Carvalho AF, Brunoni AR, Busatto GF, Gattaz WF, and Machado-Vieira R (2015) Lithium increases platelet serine-9 phosphorylated GSK-3β levels in drug-free bipolar disorder during depressive episodes..

Throughout the study, each volunteer kept a daily record of symptoms using a 5-point ordinal scale in a menstrual diary of 30 symptoms. Symptoms were grouped into six categories: anxiety, craving, depression, hydration, other, and total. Urinary magnesium output for 24 hours was estimated using the Mg/creatinine concentration ratio. ANOVA showed no overall difference between individual treatments, but predefined treatment comparisons using factorial contrasts in ANOVA showed a significant effect of 200 mg/day Mg + 50 mg/day vitamin B6 on reducing anxiety-related premenstrual symptoms (nervous tension, mood swings, irritability, or anxiety) (p = 0.040). Urinary Mg output was not affected by treatment. A small synergistic effect of a daily dietary supplementation with a combination of Mg + vitamin B6 in the reduction of mild premenstrual anxiety-related symptoms was demonstrated during treatment of 44 women for one menstrual cycle.

After 40 days of treatment, rats were killed, and Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity was determined. In the second experiment, rats were stressed during 40 days, and their performance was evaluated in the Water Maze task. The stressed group was then subdivided into four groups, with continued or interrupted stress treatment and treated or not with lithium for 30 additional days. After a second evaluation of performance in the Water Maze, rats were killed and Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity was also measured. Results showed an impairment in Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity and in Water Maze performance of chronically stressed rats, which were prevented by lithium treatment and reversed by lithium treatment and by stress interruption.

Augmentation and combination strategies are commonly employed to address this problem, but there are few randomized, controlled studies to guide treatment choice. Indeed, some of the most common augmentation strategies in depression are those with the least controlled evidence. The popularity of bupropion, psychostimulants and atypical antipsychotics as augmentors may not be warranted by existing controlled studies, whereas two less commonly used augmentors-lithium and thyroid hormone- have substantial controlled evidence to support their use.

Previously, we demonstrated an association between long-term lithium response and affective temperaments measured by the Temperament Scale of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A), and schizotypic traits, measured by the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (O-LIFE). Therefore, we were interested whether long-term lithium treatment per se may influence personality traits measured by these scales. METHODS: The study was performed on 40 patients with bipolar mood disorder (16 male, 24 female) with a mean age of 46 ± 10 years, either hospitalized or attending the outpatient clinic, Department of Adult Psychiatry, Poznan University of Medical Sciences. Among them, twenty patients (8 male, 12 female) have received lithium for 10-33 years, and twenty (8 male, 12 female) have never been exposed to lithium and have been given other mood-stabilizing drugs. Each patient, had the assessment made by the TEMPS-A and O-LIFE, during euthymic state. RESULTS: Patients on long-term lithium treatment were significantly older and had longer duration of bipolar illness compared with non-lithium patients. Lithium-treated patients obtained significantly lower scores of cyclothymic and irritable temperaments on the TEMPS-A, and of unusual experiences, cognitive disorganization and impulsive nonconformity on the O-LIFE. CONCLUSIONS: It is hypothesized that the differences in personality, revealed by the TEMPS-A and O-LIFE scales, are related to the long-term treatment with lithium. The decrease in cyclothymic temperament and in cognitive disorganization trait were previously shown to be associated with the therapeutic effect of lithium.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dembinska-Krajewska D ; Rybakowski JK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pharep.2015.05.006 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*psychology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/administration & dosage/*adverse effects\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPersonality/*drug effects\r\nPersonality Inventory\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/administration & dosage/*adverse effects\r\nYoung Adult\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nLithium\r\nO-LIFE\r\nPersonality\r\nTEMPS-A","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dembinska-Krajewska D, and Rybakowski JK (2015) Psychotropic drugs and personality changes: A case of lithium..

METHOD: Fifty-two outpatients who met DSM-III-R criteria for bipolar illness were randomly assigned in a double-blind design for an intended 1 year of treatment with lithium or carbamazepine, a crossover to the opposite drug in the second year, and then a third year on the combination. Patients received monthly detailed evaluations, and daily life chart ratings of the degree of functional incapacity associated with mania or depression were completed. RESULTS: For evaluable patients: 13 (31.0%) of 42 failed to complete a full year of lithium therapy owing to lack of efficacy, and 2 dropped out because of side effects; 13 (37.1%) of 35 withdrew from carbamazepine within the first year owing to lack of efficacy, and 10 dropped out because of side effects (9 of the 10 had a rash); 7 (24.1%) of 29 withdrew from the combination therapy owing to lack of efficacy. The percentage of the evaluable patients who had marked or moderate improvement on the Clinical Global Impressions scale was 33.3% on lithium. 31.4% on carbamazepine, and 55.2% on the combination treatment, which was not significantly different. By a variety of measures, lithium was more effective than carbamazepine in the prophylaxis of mania. Patients with a past history of rapid cycling did poorly on monotherapy (28.0% responded to lithium; 19.0% responded to carbamazepine), but significantly better on the combination (56.3%, p < .05).

Much is still unknown about the possible role of magnesium in depression prevention and treatment. Magnesium has an effect on biological and transduction pathways implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. The possible role of magnesium in depression prevention and treatment remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: We systematically reviewed the possible links between magnesium and depression in humans. METHODS: Twenty-one cross-sectional studies, three intervention trials, one prospective study, one case only study, and one case series study were included based on specific selection criteria. RESULTS: A higher intake of dietary magnesium seems to be associated with lower depression symptoms though reverse causality cannot be excluded. The results assessing the association between blood and cerebrospinal fluid magnesium and depression are inconclusive. DISCUSSION: Magnesium seems to be effective in the treatment of depression but data are scarce and incongruous. Disturbance in magnesium metabolism might be related to depression. Oral magnesium supplementation may prevent depression and might be used as an adjunctive therapy. However, more interventional and prospective studies are needed in order to further evaluate the benefits of magnesium intake and supplementation for depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Derom ML ; Sayón-Orea C ; Martínez-Ortega JM ; Martínez-González MA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1179/1476830512Y.0000000044 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nCalcium/blood\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*drug therapy\r\n*Diet\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\nMagnesium/*administration & dosage/blood/cerebrospinal fluid\r\nNeuroprotective Agents\r\nProspective Studies","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Derom ML, Sayón-Orea C, Martínez-Ortega JM, and Martínez-González MA (2013) Magnesium and depression: a systematic review..

The authors examined likelihood, speed, and predictors of recovery in older adults receiving augmentation pharmacotherapy after inadequate response to standardized treatment with paroxetine plus interpersonal psychotherapy. METHOD: Depression levels were monitored during open treatment in 195 adults age 70 or older. Patients were grouped by whether they required augmentation (bupropion, nortriptyline, or lithium) and compared on likelihood, time, and predictors of recovery. RESULTS: Augmentation was required for 105 patients (53.8%) because of inadequate treatment response (N=77) or response followed by relapse (N=28). Of these patients, 69 received augmentation and 36 did not (primarily because of consent withdrawal or comorbid medical conditions). Patients receiving augmentation showed lower recovery rates than patients never requiring augmentation: recovery occurred in 50.0% of patients receiving it because of inadequate response, 66.7% of those receiving it after early relapse, and 86.7% of patients never requiring augmentation. Patients receiving augmentation because of inadequate response recovered more slowly, with modestly more side effects than other patients. Greater medical burden and anxiety predicted slower recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a lower likelihood of recovery in elderly people receiving augmentation, the recovery by over one-half of such patients suggests the value of augmentation for those able to tolerate it. Need for augmentation presages slower recovery in patients showing initial inadequate response; those requiring it after early relapse recovered more quickly. Strategies to further improve the likelihood and speed of recovery after initial treatment failure are needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dew MA ; Whyte EM ; Lenze EJ ; Houck PR ; Mulsant BH ; Pollock BG ; Stack JA ; Bensasi S ; Reynolds CF 3rd; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/ajp.2007.164.6.892 ","Keywords":"Age Factors\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBupropion/therapeutic use\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nGeriatric Assessment\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nNortriptyline/therapeutic use\r\nParoxetine/*therapeutic use\r\nPsychotherapy/*methods\r\nSecondary Prevention\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dew MA, Whyte EM, Lenze EJ, Houck PR, Mulsant BH, Pollock BG, Stack JA, Bensasi S, and Reynolds CF 3rd (2007) Recovery from major depression in older adults receiving augmentation of antidepressant pharmacotherapy..

Given current barriers to the effective treatment of these problems, researchers are looking to the field of nutrition for potential alternatives to better understand and address mental health issues. The purpose of this article was to review current evidence on the relation between zinc and mental health disorders with a focus on 2 mental health problems that commonly affect women and children: depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A literature search of the databases Medline and PsychInfo was conducted with the use of key terms. The review included articles from 1975 to May 2008, but focused on articles published in recent years. Relations between zinc concentrations and behavior in animals; the relation between zinc deficiency, depression, and ADHD in patient and community samples; and the potential biological mechanisms for these relations were explored. The data support a relation between low concentrations of zinc and mental health problems, especially in at-risk populations. Evidence for the potential use of zinc in treating mental health problems comes mainly from patient populations and is strongest when zinc is given in combination with pharmacologic treatment. Less conclusive evidence exists for the effectiveness of zinc alone or in general community samples. Recommendations for further research in this area are provided.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"DiGirolamo AM ; Ramirez-Zea M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3945/ajcn.2008.26692C ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAnimals\r\nAttention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/drug therapy/*metabolism\r\nChild\r\nDepression/drug therapy/*metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMothers\r\nZinc/administration & dosage/*deficiency","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"DiGirolamo AM, and Ramirez-Zea M (2009) Role of zinc in maternal and child mental health..

Observational studies of depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder suggest that zinc is an alternative treatment. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of zinc supplementation on the mental health of school-age children in Guatemala. DESIGN: From January to October 2006, we conducted a 6-mo randomized, double-blind, controlled trial comparing zinc supplementation (10 mg ZnO/d for 5 d/wk) with a placebo (10 mg glucose) in 674 Guatemalan children in grades 1-4. Outcome measures included internalizing (ie, depression and anxiety) and externalizing (ie, hyperactivity and conduct disorder) problem behaviors, positive behaviors (ie, socialization and leadership), and serum zinc concentrations. RESULTS: Zinc and placebo groups did not differ significantly in any behavioral measures at baseline or at follow-up. At baseline, 21.4% of children had serum zinc concentrations <65 μg/dL. At follow-up, both groups improved significantly, and zinc concentrations were higher in the zinc group. Increases in serum zinc concentrations were inversely associated with decreases in depressive symptoms (estimate: -0.01 points per μg Zn/dL; P = 0.01), anxiety (estimate: -0.012 points per μg Zn/dL; P = 0.02), internalizing symptoms (estimate: -0.021 points per μg Zn/dL; P = 0.02), and social skills (estimate: -0.019 points per μg Zn/dL; P = 0.01) in adjusted models that were controlled for child age, sex, socioeconomic status, household, and treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Six months of zinc supplementation did not induce differences in mental health outcomes between zinc and placebo groups. However, increases in serum zinc concentrations were associated with decreases in internalizing symptoms (ie, depression and anxiety) in a community-based sample of children at risk of zinc deficiency. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00283660.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"DiGirolamo AM ; Ramirez-Zea M ; Wang M ; Flores-Ayala R ; Martorell R ; Neufeld LM ; Ramakrishnan U ; Sellen D ; Black MM ; Stein AD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3945/ajcn.2010.29686 ","Keywords":"Anxiety/blood/drug therapy\r\nChild\r\nChild Behavior/*drug effects\r\nDepression/blood/drug therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nGuatemala/epidemiology\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMental Disorders/blood/*drug therapy\r\nMental Health\r\nSocial Behavior Disorders/blood/*drug therapy\r\nTrace Elements/blood/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nZinc/blood/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"DiGirolamo AM, Ramirez-Zea M, Wang M, Flores-Ayala R, Martorell R, Neufeld LM, Ramakrishnan U, Sellen D, Black MM, and Stein AD (2010) Randomized trial of the effect of zinc supplementation on the mental health of school-age children in Guatemala..

Current research focuses on finding new pharmaceutical agents for all phases of bipolar disorder, i.e. mania, bipolar depression and maintenance. Particularly, relapse prevention and longterm stabilization is a major therapeutic target. Combination treatment and polypharmacy are the most common choices concerning relapse prevention. Furthermore, during maintenance phase patients often experience residual mood symptoms, cognitive deficits and functional decline, which altogether illustrate the inadequate effectiveness of existing treatments and the need for new, targeted, effective and safe treatments for bipolar disorder. This review focuses on active agents for maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder investigated during the last 5 years. The compounds under investigation have been tried or tested either as monotherapy or as an add-on treatment in clinical trials that have progressed up to phase 3 or in preclinical models of bipolar disorder. While awaiting the completion of many ongoing studies, the results so far indicate that paliperidone and pregabalin may have a position in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Additionally, dextromethorphan, which acts primarily as a NMDA antagonist, may be an interesting compound for further study. However, results on memantine, another NMDA antagonist, were not encouraging. The effects of omega-3 fatty acids and cytidine were not superior to placebo, although they both have neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties. Eslicarbazepine, which has antiepileptic action, provided some evidence of efficacy as monotherapy. Regarding preclinical studies in experimental models, the pharmacological agents under investigation seem to follow the neurobiological pathways related to mechanism of action of lithium, which is still the \"golden standard\" for preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder. Major therapeutic targets are synthetic glucose kinase 3 (GSK-3) and the path of phosphoinositol (IMP), both probably involved in the action of lithium. Furthermore, the role of circadian rhythms maintenance is being studied in preclinical and clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of compounds CK-01 and ramelteon, respectively. Research also focuses on pharmacological agents based on epigenetic changes and gene expression modulation, as the inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC). Of note, the development of valid and reliable experimental models for bipolar disorder, which currently remains quite controversial, will contribute to the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms and the development of new effective treatments. Improving methodology aspects of clinical trials, such as diagnosis, clinical heterogeneity, monitoring time, gender differences and comorbidities, may promote research. Current studies seem promising for the development of novel pharmacological agents in the near future, although there are methodological limitations in the search for the maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder. New therapeutic targets include not only the already known mechanisms of action, but also novel pathophysiological pathways, probably implicated in bipolar disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dimitrakopoulos S ; Konstantakopoulos G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\n*Maintenance Chemotherapy\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nRecurrence","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dimitrakopoulos S, and Konstantakopoulos G (2015) Pharmacological agents under research for the maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder..

The field has suffered from a lack of consensus on how to classify treatment resistance and from the related failure to standardise clinical criteria in trials of new therapeutic approaches. A significant proportion of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA)-resistant depression results from the failure to sustain an adequate course of therapy. This can be due to either inadequate prescribing or the poor tolerability of TCAs. The majority of cases of treatment resistance, however, involve antidepressant therapy at a dose and duration that would normally be expected to be effective. In these cases, therapy may fail for many reasons. Refractory depression may occur in patients with medical conditions such as subclinical hypothyroidism, stroke and closed head injuries. Patients with alcoholism may prove refractory to treatment, as may those receiving certain medications, notably calcium channel blockers. Certain subtypes of depression, such as rapid-cycling disorder and delusional depression, also appear to be more refractory to treatment. A variety of therapeutic approaches have been applied to treatment-resistant depression but, for most of these, placebo-controlled clinical trials with substantial numbers of patients have not been conducted. Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may have a role to play in TCA-resistant patients as a result of their superior tolerability; monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) also have a significant therapeutic role. ECT has an important role to play in patients who failed to respond to successive drug therapies. Of the various add-on therapies, thyroid augmentation (triiodothyronine) of antidepressant treatment has shown promise, and definite benefits have been established for lithium augmentation. Evidence has emerged to show that lithium is not only effective as an adjunct to TCA therapy, but also to the better tolerated SSRIs. However, further trials will be necessary to determine the optimal dosage and treatment duration for lithium augmentation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dinan T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0269881195009002051 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dinan T (1995) Treatment approaches to therapy-resistant depression..

Studies of depression have indicated that zinc play a role in the depression pathophysiology and treatment. In present study, we examined the effects of zinc and imipramine supplement alone or combination of zinc and imipramine in mice induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS). Moreover, the possible roles of zinc receptor (G protein-coupled receptor 39, GPR39)-related pathway was investigated. Decreased weight and increased corticosterone (CORT) were observed after 3 weeks CRS exposure. It was shown that CRS induced lower serum zinc, higher hippocampal zinc, increased immobility time in tail suspension test and decreased movement distance in spontaneous activity test, which could be normalized by zinc (30 mg/kg) and imipramine (20 mg/kg) supplement alone and combination of zinc (15 mg/kg) and imipramine (5 mg/kg) for 3 weeks after CRS exposure. Moreover, the changes in mRNA expressions of GPR39, cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and n-methytl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) could be reversed by the same treatment mentioned above. These results suggested that zinc dyshomeostasis in serum and hippocampus and depression-like behavior in CRS exposure animals observed in present study could be normalized by zinc and imipramine. The combination of zinc and imipramine in low dose has synergetic effects. The possible mechanism might be correlated to GPR39 receptor-related pathway.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ding Q ; Li H ; Tian X ; Shen Z ; Wang X ; Mo F ; Huang J ; Shen H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2016.03.017 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nCREB-Binding Protein/metabolism\r\nCorticosterone/blood\r\nDepression/blood/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/blood/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/*metabolism\r\nImipramine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nReceptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism\r\nReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/metabolism\r\nRestraint, Physical/*psychology\r\nSignal Transduction/drug effects\r\nStress, Psychological/etiology/*psychology\r\nZinc/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nChronic restraint stress\r\nDepression\r\nGPR39\r\nImipramine\r\nZinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ding Q, Li H, Tian X, Shen Z, Wang X, Mo F, Huang J, and Shen H (2016) Zinc and imipramine reverse the depression-like behavior in mice induced by chronic restraint stress..

This includes progressive structural brain changes, cognitive and functional decline, poorer treatment response and an increasing vulnerability to relapse with chronicity. The underlying molecular mechanisms of neuroprogression are thought to include neurotrophins and regulation of neurogenesis and apoptosis, neurotransmitters, inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, cortisol and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and epigenetic influences. Knowledge of the involvement of each of these pathways implies that specific agents that act on some or multiple of these pathways may thus block this cascade and have neuroprotective properties. This paper reviews the potential of the most promising of these agents, including lithium and other known psychotropics, aspirin, minocycline, statins, N-acetylcysteine, leptin and melatonin. These agents are putative neuroprotective agents for schizophrenia and mood disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dodd S ; Maes M ; Anderson G ; Dean OM ; Moylan S ; Berk M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2012.11.007 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAspirin/administration & dosage\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/administration & dosage\r\nMental Disorders/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology\r\nNerve Growth Factors/administration & dosage\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nSchizophrenia/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dodd S, Maes M, Anderson G, Dean OM, Moylan S, and Berk M (2013) Putative neuroprotective agents in neuropsychiatric disorders..

In this review, we aimed to summarise the evidence for various pharmacological treatment options in therapy-resistant unipolar depression derived from clinical trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and treatment guidelines. The first measure in case of insufficient response to the initial antidepressant monotherapy contains the debarment of 'pseudo-resistance', potentially caused by inadequate dose and treatment duration of the antidepressant, insufficient plasma levels, non-compliance of the patient regarding medication intake or relevant psychiatric and/or somatic comorbidities. Applying a dose escalation of the current antidepressant cannot be generally recommended as evidence-based treatment option and the efficacy depends on the class of antidepressants. There is no compelling evidence for a switch to another, new antidepressant compound after insufficient response to a previous antidepressant. The combination of two antidepressants should be preferentially established with antidepressants characterised by different mechanisms of action (e.g. reuptake inhibitors together with presynaptic autoreceptor inhibitors). At present, the most convincing body of evidence exists for the augmentation of antidepressants with second-generation antipsychotic drugs and lithium. Hence, both strategies are consistently advised by treatment guidelines as pharmacological first-line strategy in treatment-resistant depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dold M ; Kasper S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/13651501.2016.1248852 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*drug therapy\r\n*Drug Synergism\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine/*methods\r\nHumans\r\nDepression\r\nantidepressants\r\nantipsychotics\r\nlithium\r\nnon-response\r\ntreatment resistance","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dold M, and Kasper S (2017) Evidence-based pharmacotherapy of treatment-resistant unipolar depression..

Although, OABD are frequently excluded from randomized controlled trials due to their age or somatic comorbidity, more treatment data from a variety of sources have become available in recent years. It is expected that at least some of this emerging information on OABD would be incorporated into treatment guidelines available to clinicians around the world. METHODS: The International Society of Bipolar Disorders OABD task force compiled and compared recommendations from current national and international guidelines that specifically address geriatric or older individuals with BD (from year 2005 onwards). RESULTS: There were 34 guidelines, representing six continents and 19 countries. The majority of guidelines had no separate section on OABD. General principles for treating OABD with medication are recommended to be similar to those for younger adults, with special caution for side effects due to somatic comorbidity and concomitant medications. Therapeutic lithium serum levels are suggested to be lower but recommendations are very general and mostly not informed by specific research evidence. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of emphasis of OABD-specific issues in existing guidelines. Given the substantial clinical heterogeneity in BD across the life span, along with the rapidly expanding population of older individuals worldwide, and limited mental health workforce with geriatric expertise, it is critical that additional effort and resources be devoted to studying treatment interventions specific to OABD and that treatment guidelines reflect research findings.

Neuroleptic medications are still the mainstay of treatment, but recent studies suggest new approaches to dosage and to the treatment of acute psychosis. Lithium is beneficial in psychotic illnesses with acute onset and a remitting course, regardless of the acute psychotic symptoms. Antidepressant agents may ameliorate depression in psychotic patients, but do not improve psychotic symptoms or social withdrawal. Propranolol's reported antipsychotic action has not been confirmed by controlled studies, but the drug may have a role in treating organic psychoses. The benzodiazepines, clonidine, and carbamazepine all merit more investigation as possible treatments for psychosis.

Investigations performed on PPARγ and one of the essential micronutrients selenium (Se) have shown that both parameters may lead to alterations in obesity-related or mood disorders. Therefore, it is plausible to consider PPARγ and Se together as a powerful combination during the treatment of two associated diseases; obesity and depression. PPARγ has been shown to be involved in the antidepressant-like activity. It is also an important parameter to be considered in obesity as the master regulator of adipogenesis. The mechanism of action of PPARγ is initiated by ligand binding which induces a conformational change in the receptor. Se is capable of alleviating inflammatory signaling pathways. Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. Depression is also defined as an inflammatory disorder. Inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) participate in the progression of depression. They are also obesity-associated parameters. Due to TNFα induced depressive-like behaviors and the positive association between this proinflammatory cytokine and obesity, TNFα-activated signaling pathways and those inhibiting them have recently gained importance as potential targets and therapeutic tools, respectively. More studies are necessary to develop compounds with therapeutic nature against depressive disorders and obesity. PPARγ is an important signaling pathway that occurs at the crossroads of depression and obesity. Se, aside from its anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic and antioxidative nature, affects also the way of PPARγ action. Se supplementation or fortification as well as the development of the partial agonists of PPARγ in which lipophilic Se compounds are used as ligand followed by experimental trials and human studies using the newly developed compounds will be promising approaches for future hope during the treatment of these diseases.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Donma MM ; Donma O ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.mehy.2016.02.008 ","Keywords":"Depression/*drug therapy/*immunology\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine\r\nHumans\r\nModels, Immunological\r\nObesity/*drug therapy/*immunology\r\nPPAR gamma/agonists/*immunology\r\nSelenium/*administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Donma MM, and Donma O (2016) Promising link between selenium and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma in the treatment protocols of obesity as well as depression..

Furthermore, recent preclinical studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that in rodents, chronic stress and the stress hormone cortisol cause oxidative damage to mitochondrial function and membrane lipids in the brain. Mitochondria play a key role in synaptic neurotransmitter signaling by providing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), mediating lipid and protein synthesis, buffering intracellular calcium, and regulating apoptotic and resilience pathways. Membrane lipids are similarly essential to central nervous system (CNS) function because cholesterol, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and sphingolipids form a lipid raft region, a special lipid region on the membrane that mediates neurotransmitter signaling through G-protein-coupled receptors and ion channels. Low serum cholesterol levels, low antioxidant capacity, and abnormal early morning cortisol levels are biomarkers consistently associated with both depression and suicidal behaviors. In this review, we summarize the manner in which nutrients can protect against oxidative damage to mitochondria and lipids in the neuronal circuits associated with cognitive and affective behaviors. These nutrients include ω3 fatty acids, antioxidants (vitamin C and zinc), members of the vitamin B family (Vitamin B12 and folic acid), and magnesium. Accumulating data have shown that these nutrients can enhance neurocognitive function, and may have therapeutic benefits for depression and suicidal behaviors. A growing body of studies suggests the intriguing possibility that regular consumption of these nutrients may help prevent the onset of mood disorders and suicidal behaviors in vulnerable individuals, or significantly augment the therapeutic effect of available antidepressants. These findings have important implications for the health of both military and civilian populations.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Du J ; Zhu M ; Bao H ; Li B ; Dong Y ; Xiao C ; Zhang GY ; Henter I ; Rudorfer M ; Vitiello B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/10408398.2013.876960 ","Keywords":"Antioxidants/administration & dosage\r\nCholesterol/blood\r\nDepression/*diet therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nHydrocortisone/blood\r\nMagnesium/administration & dosage\r\nMilitary Personnel\r\nMitochondria/*physiology\r\nNeurotransmitter Agents/*metabolism\r\nOxidative Stress/drug effects\r\nSignal Transduction\r\nSleep Deprivation/complications\r\nStress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*diet therapy\r\nStress, Psychological/complications\r\nVitamin B Complex/administration & dosage\r\n*Suicide Prevention\r\nVitamin\r\nlipid\r\noxidative stress\r\nsuicide\r\nsynaptic plasticity\r\nzinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Du J, Zhu M, Bao H, Li B, Dong Y, Xiao C, Zhang GY, Henter I, Rudorfer M, and Vitiello B (2016) The Role of Nutrients in Protecting Mitochondrial Function and Neurotransmitter Signaling: Implications for the Treatment of Depression, PTSD, and Suicidal Behaviors..

RECENT FINDINGS: Mania can be a primary psychiatric disorder but can also be a symptom of a neurologic disorder, especially right-sided cerebrovascular disease. Treatments (such as corticosteroids and dopaminergic agents) for neurologic illnesses regularly induce mania. The neurobiology of primary mania and bipolar disorder involves alterations in intracellular signaling, changes in gene expression, neural network interactions, and apoptosis. Except when induced by time-limited treatment with a provoking agent, mania tends to be highly recurrent and to alternate or be exhibited alongside depression. Symptoms of mania become more complex and treatment refractory with time, although effective treatment improves the long-term outcome. SUMMARY: Behavioral manifestations of mania may be more obvious than affective symptoms, especially in patients with aprosodia. Atypical antipsychotic drugs are often first-line acute treatments, but the evidence supporting their long-term prophylactic efficacy is questionable. In addition to being an established mood stabilizer, lithium has putative neuroprotective properties, although a side effect can be impaired memory.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dubovsky SL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1212/01.CON.0000466663.28026.6f ","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/*diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/*therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNervous System Diseases/epidemiology\r\nNeurobiology\r\nStroke/complications\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dubovsky SL (2015) Mania..

METHODS: This is a narrative review of key studies pertaining to the effectiveness and tolerability of lithium treatment in pediatric populations. RESULTS: Evidence supports that lithium is an effective and generally well-tolerated acute treatment for pediatric mania compared to placebo. Lithium may be less effective than risperidone for treating chronic mixed/manic symptoms in young children but comparable to anticonvulsants. However, in comparison, risperidone was associated with higher weight gain and prolactin levels. There is a lack of evidence inform maintenance treatment in children who benefit from lithium. Other indications that require further study include treatment of refractory or recurrent major depression in children at confirmed familial risk of bipolar disorder, as well as the treatment of acute suicidal ideation/behavior and refractory aggression. DISCUSSION: There is inadequate data about the full variety of benefit and tolerability of lithium treatment in pediatric patients. However, given the potential for protection against suicide and neurotoxic effects of illness, further studies should be a priority.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Duffy A ; Grof P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1055/a-0575-4179 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nChild\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Duffy A, and Grof P (2018) Lithium Treatment in Children and Adolescents..

These differences were almost entirely due to superior improvements concerning sleep and agitation. In regard to delusions, eight patients improved on the specific HAM-D items in the neuroleptic group, but only two in the lithium group. After week 4, the two groups no longer differed (HAM-D group 1: 14.5 +/- 5.0; group 2: 13.5 +/- 4.5). Delusions were absent in 17 patients treated with haloperidol and in 13 patients treated with lithium according to HAM-D ratings. After week 6, the lithium comedication was even superior, although not reaching significance (HAM-D group 1: 10.5 +/- 4.5; group 2: 8.5 +/- 6.5). Although 17 patients treated with neuroleptics but only 15 treated with lithium were free of delusions, the lithium group had a better outcome in terms of depressed mood and psychomotor items. The lithium group had significantly fewer extrapyramidal and vegetative side effects.\nIn terms of the CGI Scale data, 80% of the patients were much improved or better in the haloperidol group after week 6 and 75% in the lithium group. The time of onset of improvement was earlier in the neuroleptic group, because no patient in the lithium group was rated much improved after week 2, but four patients in the other group reached this CGI Scale rating.\nAll seven bipolar patients but only 8 of 13 unipolar patients were much improved by lithium. In contrast, 13 of 14 unipolar patients but only 3 of 6 bipolar patients were much improved in the neuroleptic group. chi squared Tests showed a significant superiority of lithium in the bipolar group (p < 0.03) and a significant superiority of neuroleptics in the unipolar group (p < 0.05).\n回到顶端\nDiscussion\nOur results are in accordance with findings in the literature that 60 to 80% of patients with delusional depression respond to a combination therapy with TCA and a neuroleptic substance. [4] The first positive effects can be observed after 1 or 2 weeks; however, improvement is restricted to reductions in delusions and improvements in sleep or agitation. Under the lithium combination therapy, improvement occurred only after week 4 with a similar improvement rate of 75% after week 6. It is remarkable that fewer side effects occurred in the lithium group, especially that no extrapyramidal effects were present. In terms of the HAM-D ratings, depressed mood, activity, and psychomotor inhibition were less improved in the neuroleptic group.\nFrom our data, TCA-lithium combinations seem to be an appropriate therapy for delusional depression, showing fewer side effects and better improvement of some depressive symptoms compared with TCA-neuroleptic combinations. The effect of the lithium-TCA combination is possibly restricted to bipolar patients.\nBecause this study was designed as an open study with severe methodologic shortcomings (no double-blind design, no randomization, no TCA blood levels), it can only be recommended that the lithium-TCA treatment of delusional depression needs further investigation in a controlled design.\nDieter Ebert, MD\nDepartment of Psychiatry; University of Freiburg; Freiburg, Germany\n","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ebert D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00004714-199704000-00018 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAffective Disorders, Psychotic/*drug therapy\r\nAnalysis of Variance\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Chloride/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ebert D (1997) Lithium-TCA combination treatment of psychotic depression: comparison with TCA-neuroleptic treatment..

It is also perfectly suited to the well established outpatient model practised in general practice and psychiatry. All GP practices should include people with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder on their case register of people with severe mental illness. It is not possible to exclude a bipolar diagnosis categorically if there are only symptoms of depression. Most patients will have had a (hypo)manic episode by their 30s. The lifetime prevalence of bipolar affective disorder proper is 1%, with a further 1.2% presenting with milder hypomanic symptoms (so-called bipolar II disorder). Relaxing diagnostic symptom criteria increases the frequency of depressed patients who develop symptoms of mania for any length of time to 50%. The lifetime course of the illness tends to be dominated by depressive episodes: half the time is estimated to be spent in the euthymic (well) state, 12% in a manic state and 38% in a depressed state. Any depressed patient should be asked about periods in the past when (s)he has been elated in mood, found it unnecessary to sleep, talked a lot, spent excessive amounts of money etc. Treatment for bipolar disorder has to be divided into: treatment of mania, treatment of bipolar depression and prophylaxis of mood swings in either direction. Antidepressant treatments are unlikely to help manic symptoms, at worst they can precipitate or aggravate them. Antimanic treatments are unlikely to help symptoms of depression but an exception to this rule would be a genuine mood stabiliser, such as lithium. Patients with bipolar disorder should have an annual physical health review. This will include monitoring for weight gain, lipid levels, plasma glucose levels, smoking status and alcohol use, as well as blood pressure.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ebmeier KP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLong-Term Care\r\nSecondary Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ebmeier KP (2010) Managing bipolar disorder in primary care..

Antidepressant drugs are not always effective and some have been accused of causing an increased number of suicides particularly in young people. Magnesium deficiency is well known to produce neuropathologies. Only 16% of the magnesium found in whole wheat remains in refined flour, and magnesium has been removed from most drinking water supplies, setting a stage for human magnesium deficiency. Magnesium ions regulate calcium ion flow in neuronal calcium channels, helping to regulate neuronal nitric oxide production. In magnesium deficiency, neuronal requirements for magnesium may not be met, causing neuronal damage which could manifest as depression. Magnesium treatment is hypothesized to be effective in treating major depression resulting from intraneuronal magnesium deficits. These magnesium ion neuronal deficits may be induced by stress hormones, excessive dietary calcium as well as dietary deficiencies of magnesium. Case histories are presented showing rapid recovery (less than 7 days) from major depression using 125-300 mg of magnesium (as glycinate and taurinate) with each meal and at bedtime. Magnesium was found usually effective for treatment of depression in general use. Related and accompanying mental illnesses in these case histories including traumatic brain injury, headache, suicidal ideation, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, postpartum depression, cocaine, alcohol and tobacco abuse, hypersensitivity to calcium, short-term memory loss and IQ loss were also benefited. Dietary deficiencies of magnesium, coupled with excess calcium and stress may cause many cases of other related symptoms including agitation, anxiety, irritability, confusion, asthenia, sleeplessness, headache, delirium, hallucinations and hyperexcitability, with each of these having been previously documented. The possibility that magnesium deficiency is the cause of most major depression and related mental health problems including IQ loss and addiction is enormously important to public health and is recommended for immediate further study. Fortifying refined grain and drinking water with biologically available magnesium to pre-twentieth century levels is recommended.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Eby GA ; Eby KL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.mehy.2006.01.047 ","Keywords":"*Convalescence\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/*etiology\r\nHumans\r\nMagnesium/*therapeutic use\r\nMagnesium Deficiency/*complications\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Eby GA, and Eby KL (2006) Rapid recovery from major depression using magnesium treatment..

Magnesium-deficiency causes N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) coupled calcium channels to be biased towards opening, causing neuronal injury and neurological dysfunction, which may appear to humans as major depression. Oral administration of magnesium to animals led to anti-depressant-like effects that were comparable to those of strong anti-depressant drugs. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) magnesium has been found low in treatment-resistant suicidal depression and in patients that have attempted suicide. Brain magnesium has been found low in TRD using phosphorous nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, an accurate means for measuring brain magnesium. Blood and CSF magnesium do not appear well correlated with major depression. Although the first report of magnesium treatment for agitated depression was published in 1921 showing success in 220 out of 250 cases, and there are modern case reports showing rapid terminating of TRD, only a few modern clinical trials were found. A 2008 randomized clinical trial showed that magnesium was as effective as the tricyclic anti-depressant imipramine in treating depression in diabetics and without any of the side effects of imipramine. Intravenous and oral magnesium in specific protocols have been reported to rapidly terminate TRD safely and without side effects. Magnesium has been largely removed from processed foods, potentially harming the brain. Calcium, glutamate and aspartate are common food additives that may worsen affective disorders. We hypothesize that - when taken together - there is more than sufficient evidence to implicate inadequate dietary magnesium as the main cause of TRD, and that physicians should prescribe magnesium for TRD. Since inadequate brain magnesium appears to reduce serotonin levels, and since anti-depressants have been shown to have the action of raising brain magnesium, we further hypothesize that magnesium treatment will be found beneficial for nearly all depressives, not only TRD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Eby GA 3rd; Eby KL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.mehy.2009.10.051 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use\r\nBrain\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nD-Aspartic Acid\r\nDepression\r\nDepressive Disorder/complications/drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/*etiology\r\nFast Foods\r\nHumans\r\nImipramine/therapeutic use\r\nMagnesium/*therapeutic use\r\nMagnesium Deficiency/*complications\r\nMental Disorders/complications/drug therapy\r\n*Models, Neurological\r\nN-Methylaspartate/therapeutic use\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nSuicide, Attempted","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Eby GA 3rd, and Eby KL (2010) Magnesium for treatment-resistant depression: a review and hypothesis..

The causes of depression are not fully understood, although there is evidence to suggest that depression is a complex interaction among biological, genetic, psychosocial and environmental factors. Strategies available for the treatment of patients with TRD include pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and psychological and psychosocial interventions. Pharmacological treatment options include switching to a different antidepressant, the addition of another antidepressant of a different class, or use of an augmenting agent, such as anticonvulsants, lithium or atypical antipsychotics (AAPs). However, there is limited evidence available on the effectiveness of these strategies in the treatment of TRD. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of augmentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant therapy with either lithium or an AAP drug in the management of people with treatment-resistant unipolar depression, defined as failure to respond to two or more antidepressant drugs in their current episode of depression. DATA SOURCES: Databases searched were Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED). All databases were searched from inception to August 2011. Additional data were obtained from manufacturers. REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews of studies evaluating clinical effectiveness, economic analyses and quality of life (QoL) were executed. Quality assessment according to predefined criteria was undertaken independently by two reviewers. Pairwise meta-analyses and mixed-treatment comparisons (MTCs) using both fixed- and random-effects models were undertaken based on intention-to-treat analyses. A probabilistic de novo mathematical model was developed to synthesise the available data on costs and clinical outcomes from the UK NHS perspective over a 1-year time horizon (8 weeks of acute treatment captured by a decision tree and 10 months of maintenance treatment captured by a Markov model). RESULTS: Twelve randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified in the review of clinical effectiveness literature; 10 considered SSRI + AAP compared with SSRI + placebo/no treatment, one considered SSRI + AAP compared with SSRI + lithium and one considered SSRI + lithium compared with SSRI + placebo. The RCTs included in the primary analyses used fluoxetine as the background SSRI and olanzapine as the AAP. Results of the MTC showed a non-significant trend in favour of lithium augmentation for response [lithium a priori odds ratio (OR) 1.29; 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.11 to 5.32; lithium post hoc OR 4.15; 95% CrI 0.25 to 20.34 (the trial informing the comparison with lithium reported response using two different definitions)], mean change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score from baseline (mean difference - 1.47, 95% CrI - 9.10 to 6.41) and all-cause withdrawals (OR 0.74, 95% CrI 0.10 to 2.66). Four economic evaluations (none directly addressing the review question) and 17 studies that reported on QoL were identified and summarised in narrative reviews. The results of the de novo modelling indicate that augmentation of SSRI with lithium dominates augmentation of an SSRI with AAP (i.e. it resulted in cost savings of £905 per person per year and generated more health benefits, estimated to be 0.03 quality-adjusted life-years). However, sensitivity analyses showed that the model was highly sensitive to changes in acute treatment efficacy (response and remission) or discontinuation. The model was not sensitive to changes in other parameters. LIMITATIONS: In patients with TRD, there is a lack of direct evidence comparing the clinical effectiveness of augmenting an SSRI with an AAP compared with augmenting with lithium. RCTs were identified which facilitated comparison of adding AAP with adding lithium via a MTC. However, variations in the definitions of response implemented in the RCTs, together with differences in patient baseline characteristics across RCTs, introduce bias into the analysis. The direction and extent of the bias is uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Augmentation of SSRIs with lithium or AAP is likely to be beneficial in people with TRD. Clinical evaluation based on the limited evidence identified in this research indicates no statistically significant difference between the two augmentation strategies. Cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that augmentation with lithium is less expensive and more effective than augmentation with AAP. However, the uncertainty in the clinical estimates of discontinuation and treatment response is reflected in the model results. A RCT comparing the two augmentation strategies, reporting relevant outcomes, including QoL, is needed.

Lithium continues to be the most useful agent available for the prophylaxis and treatment of bipolar illness. Lithium augmentation of antidepressants is useful in treatment-resistant unipolar depression.

In internal medicine, lithium has proven useful in the prophylaxis of cluster headaches and in ameliorating chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Other miscellaneous uses in both psychiatry and medicine have been anecdotally reported and are reviewed. However, the use of lithium may be limited by acute and chronic toxic side effects. Acute toxicity almost always manifests as central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, and the degree of toxicity usually parallels the extent of CNS dysfunction. Chronic toxic manifestations effect cardiac, renal, and endocrine systems.

METHODS: English language controlled clinical trials involving BPII patients obtained from an extensive Medline search were critically reviewed. RESULTS: Agents that have potential utility in the treatment of BPII are profiled, based on their efficacy in bipolar I (BPI) or unipolar depression. CONCLUSIONS: The most efficacious agents are likely those with bimodal stabilizing properties, such as lithium, carbamazepine, and quetiapine. In fact, on the strength of favorable efficacy data obtained in patients with major depressive symptoms accompanying bipolar disorder, quetiapine recently became the first agent to be indicated by the FDA for monotherapeutic use in the treatment of bipolar depression, including BPII depression. Aside from the aforementioned agents, lamotrigine also shows promise in the treatment of BPII.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"El-Mallakh R ; Weisler RH ; Townsend MH ; Ginsberg LD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/10401230600948480 ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nControlled Clinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"El-Mallakh R, Weisler RH, Townsend MH, and Ginsberg LD (2006) Bipolar II disorder: current and future treatment options..

When RCTs are not available or are inadequate, naturalistic data or open studies are also reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Efficacy and safety of pharmaceutical agents in adolescents with BD appear to mirror adults with BD. Lithium/mood stabilizers are preferred first-line agents over antipsychotic medications, but the latter are second-line agents particularly in bipolar depression. When lithium is used, serum levels approaching 1.0 mEq/L are reasonable since younger people appear to require/tolerate higher levels. Among the antipsychotics, quetiapine appeared to be minimally better than risperidone while risperidone was associated with greater adverse events. Antipsychotics with antidepressant activity in adults also appear to have antidepressant effects in youths. Use of antidepressants in bipolar depression is generally not recommended although it may be reasonable in specific clinical situations. The similarities between adolescent and adult outcomes suggest that it is reasonable to utilize adult data to aid with clinical decision making in adolescents with BD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Elsayed OH ; Pahwa M ; El-Mallakh RS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/14656566.2022.2083954 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nChild\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nRisperidone/therapeutic use\r\nAdolescents\r\nantidepressants\r\nantipsychotics\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ndepression\r\nmania\r\nmood stabilizers\r\npediatrics\r\npsychopharmacotherapy\r\ntreatment\r\nyouth","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Elsayed OH, Pahwa M, and El-Mallakh RS (2022) Pharmacologic treatment and management of bipolar disorder in adolescents..

Lithium is used successfully in the prophylaxis and treatment of manic-depression. The mechanism by which it exerts its effects is still not very clear. There is much evidence to indicate that lithium may exert its therapeutic action by interfering with the metabolism of phosphoinositides which play an important role in synaptic transmission. Because of lithium's narrow therapeutic/toxic ratio, blood concentration monitoring is crucial. Published data suggest that, compared to lithium, carbamazepine is similar in its relative specificity in treating mania. It is often faster in achieving its antimanic effects and best established as an alternative for patients not responding or intolerant to lithium. Carbamazepine is a good substitute for lithium when severe renal problems exclude the use of lithium. The therapeutic profile of valproic acid in manic-depression, although less extensively studied, appears to be similar to that of carbamazepine. As carbamazepine, it seems to be best indicated in patients with rapid cycles. Whereas lithium inhibits myo-inositol monophosphatase, carbamazepine shows a stimulating effect and valproic acid has no effect on this biochemical target. The implication of the inositol pathway in the pathogenesis of adverse effects, such as neurotoxicity and dermatological irritation, is discussed. A further understanding of this pathway is important for the future development of new lithium-like compounds in order to maximize the therapeutic benefits without the adverse effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Emilien G ; Maloteaux JM ; Seghers A ; Charles G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBinding, Competitive\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/etiology/prevention & control\r\nCalcium Channel Blockers/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nCarbamazepine/administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nInositol Phosphates/antagonists & inhibitors\r\nLithium/administration & dosage/adverse \r\n      effects/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nPhosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism\r\nSignal Transduction/drug effects\r\nValproic Acid/administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Emilien G, Maloteaux JM, Seghers A, and Charles G (1995) Lithium therapy in the treatment of manic-depressive illness.

Biologic depressions are now understood as neurotransmitter deficiency diseases. Certain forms of depression are treated with tricyclic antidepressant drugs, which increase the amount of available neurotransmitters. Complicating the clinical picture, however, is the problem of wide variability of levels of tricyclic drugs in the plasma of persons receiving the same dosage. Another problem is the apparent linear dose-response relationship of imipramine hydrochloride and its sister compound desipramine hydrochloride while amitriptyline and nortriptyline follow an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve. However, with newer, more sophisticated diagnostic methods, combined with monitoring of tricyclic drug levels in plasma, therapeutic efficacy can approach 90 percent. Available neurotransmitters also can be increased using monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Although MAO inhibitors have been less popular than the tricyclic drugs, recent clinical research tends to support their efficacy. Distinct individual differences in the rate of metabolism of MAO inhibitors have been found. New methods are being devised to detect these differences and monitor directly the effects of these drugs. One of these methods, platelet MAO inhibition, shows some clinical promise. Tricyclic drugs and MAO inhibitors have recently been joined by lithium carbonate, which shows notable efficacy in removing acute manic-depressive symptoms as well as preventing their return during maintenance treatment. Its utility in treating cyclic depressions without mania is now being explored by researchers.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ericksen SE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/adverse effects/blood/pharmacology/*therapeutic \r\n      use\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ericksen SE (1979) Recent advances in antidepressant drug treatment..

Results of a MedLine search are critically reviewed for lithium, divalproex and other anticonvulsants, conventional and atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants. The existing literature is almost entirely limited to noncontrolled, often retrospective studies that do not control for potential biases in treatment selection, the use of multiple medications, the impact of medication nonadherence, and nonrandomized treatment discontinuations. Nevertheless, an extensive literature has arisen regarding observed reductions in suicidal behavior with lithium for mood disorders and, to a lesser extent, with clozapine for schizophrenia. A substantially smaller literature suggests more negative than positive data with divalproex or carbamazepine in bipolar disorder, while minimal information exists regarding suicidality with atypical antipsychotics other than clozapine. Studies of antidepressants have mostly been short-term and have focused more on whether they induce (rather than ameliorate) suicidal thoughts or behaviors. The sum of existing studies is generally inconclusive about whether antidepressants appreciably reduce risk for suicide completions. Relatively little is known about pharmacotherapy effects on suicidal ideation as distinct from behaviors. Possible mechanistic considerations for understanding antisuicide properties include a therapeutic impact on depression, impulsivity, or aggression, potentially mediated through serotonergic or other neuromodulatory systems.

In developed countries, the incidence of postnatal depression is about 10-15% in adult women depending upon the diagnostic criteria, timing of screening and screening instruments used. Mothers with depressive symptoms have been found to have more complex behavioral contacts with their children; this situation can damage family relationships, and even leads to infanticide. Various pathophysiologies are proposed for postpartum depression: Nutritional deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia, rapid decrease in the levels of reproductive hormones following delivery, alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adernocortical mechanism and alterations in neurotransmitter levels. Among pathophysiologies of postpartum depression, the role of trace elements is highlighted. The purpose of this review is to assess the role of trace elements including zinc, magnesium, iron and copper in PPD. Zinc as a trace element has the second highest concentration of all transition metals in the brain, and its deficiency is associated with behavioral disturbances. Lower zinc blood concentration was found in women with postpartum depression. Another trace element, magnesium, also influences the nervous system via its actions on the release and metabolism of neurotransmitters. Various studies have focused on antidepressant-like effects of magnesium and its deficiency has been reported in depression. Depletion of magnesium stores during pregnancy is hypothesized to be the cause of postpartum depression. Iron deficiency is the most common single nutrient deficiency in the world. There is an association between anemia and depressive disorders. Copper has been recognized as an essential element for many years. Iron also plays a vital role in neurological disorders and its levels are relevant to postpartum depression. Involvement of trace elements can be seen in pathophysiologies of PPD in different ways. Therefore, trace element supplementation can be an alternative treatment for patients with PPD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Etebary S ; Nikseresht S ; Sadeghipour HR ; Zarrindast MR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Copper\r\nIron\r\nMagnesium\r\nPostpartum depression\r\nTrace element\r\nZinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Etebary S, Nikseresht S, Sadeghipour HR, and Zarrindast MR (2010) Postpartum depression and role of serum trace elements..

This study aimed to identify new possible pharmacological options for TRD. Genes in pathways included in predictive models of TRD in a previous whole exome sequence study were compared with those coding for targets of drugs in any phase of development, nutraceuticals, proteins and peptides from Drug repurposing Hub, Drug-Gene Interaction database and DrugBank database. We tested if known gene targets were enriched in TRD-associated genes by a hypergeometric test. Compounds enriched in TRD-associated genes after false-discovery rate (FDR) correction were annotated and compared with those showing enrichment in genes associated with MDD in the last Psychiatric Genomics Consortium genome-wide association study. Among a total of 15,475 compounds, 542 were enriched in TRD-associated genes (FDR p < .05). Significant results included drugs which are currently used in TRD (e.g. lithium and ketamine), confirming the rationale of this approach. Interesting molecules included modulators of inflammation, renin-angiotensin system, proliferator-activated receptor agonists, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta inhibitors and the rho associated kinase inhibitor fasudil. Nutraceuticals, mostly antioxidant polyphenols, were also identified. Drugs showing enrichment for TRD-associated genes had a higher probability of enrichment for MDD-associated genes compared to those having no TRD-genes enrichment (p = 6.21e-55). This study suggested new potential treatments for TRD using a in silico approach. These analyses are exploratory only but can contribute to the identification of drugs to study in future clinical trials.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fabbri C ; Kasper S ; Zohar J ; Souery D ; Montgomery S ; Albani D ; Forloni G ; Ferentinos P ; Rujescu D ; Mendlewicz J ; De Ronchi D ; Riva MA ; Lewis CM ; Serretti A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110050 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDatabases, Factual\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Repositioning\r\nHumans\r\nPharmacogenomic Testing\r\nDrug repurposing\r\nMajor depression\r\nPharmacogenetics\r\nTreatment-resistant depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fabbri C, Kasper S, Zohar J, Souery D, Montgomery S, Albani D, Forloni G, Ferentinos P, Rujescu D, Mendlewicz J, De Ronchi D, Riva MA, Lewis CM, and Serretti A (2021) Drug repositioning for treatment-resistant depression: Hypotheses from a pharmacogenomic study..

The authors retrospectively evaluated the safety of the combination of lithium and paroxetine when the two medications were sequentially prescribed in patients with bipolar disorder. The authors examined a sample of 17 patients with bipolar disorder who were treated with lithium during a depressive episode and who required paroxetine as an adjunctive antidepressant to ongoing lithium treatment. Averaging across all subjects, no statistically significant increase was found for any of the somatic symptoms that were assessed before and after paroxetine was added to ongoing lithium therapy. Examining the clinical records of each patient in detail; however, four patients who developed significant adverse events, possibly related to an emerging serotonin syndrome were identified. Clinicians should be aware of the possible development of a serotonin syndrome among patients in whom paroxetine is added to ongoing lithium treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fagiolini A ; Buysse DJ ; Frank E ; Houck PR ; Luther JF ; Kupfer DJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00004714-200110000-00003 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBipolar Disorder/blood/complications/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/blood/complications/*drug therapy\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nParoxetine/*adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nSerotonin Syndrome/blood/*chemically induced\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/*adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fagiolini A, Buysse DJ, Frank E, Houck PR, Luther JF, and Kupfer DJ (2001) Tolerability of combined treatment with lithium and paroxetine in patients with bipolar disorder and depression..

Compared with bipolar patients without mixed features, patients with bipolar mixed states generally have more severe symptomatology, more lifetime episodes of illness, worse clinical outcomes and higher rates of comorbidities, and thus present a significant clinical challenge. Most clinical trials have investigated second-generation neuroleptic monotherapy, monotherapy with anticonvulsants or lithium, combination therapy, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Neuroleptic drugs are often used alone or in combination with anticonvulsants or lithium for preventive treatment, and ECT is an effective treatment for mixed manic episodes in situations where medication fails or cannot be used. Common antidepressants have been shown to worsen mania symptoms during mixed episodes without necessarily improving depressive symptoms; thus, they are not recommended during mixed episodes. A greater understanding of pathophysiological processes in bipolar disorder is now required to provide a more accurate diagnosis and new personalised treatment approaches. Targeted, specific treatments developed through a greater understanding of bipolar disorder pathophysiology, capable of affecting the underlying disease processes, could well prove to be more effective, faster acting, and better tolerated than existing therapies, therefore providing better outcomes for individuals affected by bipolar disorder. Until such time as targeted agents are available, second-generation neuroleptics are emerging as the treatment of choice in the management of mixed states in bipolar disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fagiolini A ; Coluccia A ; Maina G ; Forgione RN ; Goracci A ; Cuomo A ; Young AH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s40263-015-0275-6 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDatabases, Bibliographic/statistics & numerical data\r\n*Disease Management\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fagiolini A, Coluccia A, Maina G, Forgione RN, Goracci A, Cuomo A, and Young AH (2015) Diagnosis, Epidemiology and Management of Mixed States in Bipolar Disorder..

MATERIALS & METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial study, registered in www.irct.ir with the code of IRCT201410126418N3, overall 44 patients with bipolar disorder with acute manic episode were randomly assigned into treatment and control groups. The serum levels of lithium and tamoxifen among the participants in the treatment groups were 0.8 -1.1 mg and 20-40 mg per day respectively. Serum level of lithium among participants in the control group was similar. The main comparisons were made based on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Children Depression Inventory (CDI) scores of the participants at baseline and at the end of each study week. The pharmacological side effects of serum level of lithium were examined weekly. Analysis of Covariance(ANCOVA) test was used for the statistical analysis. RESULTS: There was no difference in the baseline score of YMRS and CDI in the treatment and control groups while a statistical significant difference (P < 0.05) in these scores was found between and within the groups. CONCLUSION: The addition of tamoxifen to lithium causes a significant difference in reducing the symptoms of mania and depression in the treatment group compared to the control group.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fallah E ; Arman S ; Najafi M ; Shayegh B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Children\r\nLithium\r\nMania\r\nProtein Kinase C\r\nTamoxifen","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fallah E, Arman S, Najafi M, and Shayegh B (2016) Effect of Tamoxifen and Lithium on Treatment of Acute Mania Symptoms in Children and Adolescents..

Because of certain age-related physical, physiological, and biochemical factors, however, drug prescription for geriatric patients must be modified in several respects. Tricyclic antidepressants are the principal agents in treatment, but their side effects tend to be magnified in the elderly. Dosage should initially be lower than with younger patients and increased in gradual increments. Lithium, MAO inhibitors, and neuroleptics are appropriate in some cases, but additional precautions are necessary. Because the elderly are liable to multiple system decompensation, they are likely to be prescribed multiple pharmacological agents. Drug-drug interactions involving antidepressant medication present a variety of therapeutic problems and can threaten life. Depression in late life can be treated pharmacologically, but both the therapeutic and deleterious activities of the drugs can be altered by compromised organ systems.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fann WE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/geronj/31.3.304 ","Keywords":"Adjustment Disorders/drug therapy\r\nAge Factors\r\nAged\r\nAmino Acids/therapeutic use\r\nAnti-Anxiety Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nCentral Nervous System Stimulants/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Interactions\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/adverse effects/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fann WE (1976) Pharmacotherapy in older depressed patients..

We aimed to assess efficacy of pharmacological treatments in prevention of depression. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Psych Info, EMBASE, and CINHAL from 1980 to January 2020 and bibliographies of relevant systematic reviews. We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that used a pharmacological intervention to prevent the onset of the new depressive episode in adult population. Study selection, data extraction and reporting was done following PRISMA guidelines. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: 28 trials (2745 participants) were included in meta-analysis. Antidepressants (22 studies), Selenium, Hormone Replacement Therapy Omega-3 fatty acids and Melatonin were used to prevent depression, mostly in physical conditions associated with high risk of depression. All pharmacological interventions [pooled Odds Ratios (OR) 0.37 CI (0.25-0.54)], and antidepressants (OR 0.29, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.46) were significantly more effective than placebo in preventing depression. Antidepressants were significantly better than placebo in trials that had low risk of bias (n = 16; OR 0.43 [0.30, 0.60]), in preventing post stroke depression (OR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.55) and depression associated with Hepatitis C (OR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.31, 1.02). Limitations include small number of studies focussed only on high risk conditions and short follow up in most studies. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of depression may be possible in patients who have high-risk conditions such as stroke but the strategy requires complete risk and benefits analysis before it can be considered for clinical practice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Farooq S ; Singh SP ; Burke D ; Naeem F ; Ayub M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2020.03.024 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Depression/prevention & control\r\nHumans\r\nDepression\r\nDepressive illness\r\nDrugs\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nPharmacological agents\r\nPrevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Farooq S, Singh SP, Burke D, Naeem F, and Ayub M (2020) Pharmacological interventions for prevention of depression in high risk conditions: Systematic review and meta-analysis..

Domestic animals are found infected by their COVID-2 suffering owners. Chronic immobilization stress (CIS), a model of psychological and physical stress of confinement, can trigger depression and anxiety in animals. We evaluated the ameliorative effect of the proposed SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic drugs melatonin, vitamin C, and zinc on CIS-induced OS, inflammation, and DNA damage in rats. Forty male Swiss albino rats (200-250 g, 7-9 weeks old) were divided into five groups as controls, CIS, treated with melatonin (20 mg/kg), and vitamin C plus zinc [VitC+Zn (250 + 2.5 mg/kg)] alone or in combination (melatonin+VitC+zinc) subjected to CIS for 3 weeks. CIS was induced by immobilizing the whole body of the rats in wire mesh cages of their size with free movement of head. Exposure to CIS significantly compromised the circulatory activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione with enhanced malondialdehyde, inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL10, and TNFα), and lymphocyte DNA damage in comparison to controls. Treatment with melatonin and VitC+Zn alone or in combination significantly restored the altered biochemical parameters and DNA damage of stressed rats to their respective control values. However, the cumulative action of melatonin with VitC+Zn was more effective in alleviating the CIS-induced OS, inflammation, and DNA damage. The present study indicates that the antioxidant combination can be an effective preventive measure to combat severe psychological and confinement stress-induced biochemical changes in animals due to abnormal conditions such as SARS-CoV-2.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fatima S ; Zaidi SS ; Alsharidah AS ; Aljaser FS ; Banu N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fvets.2020.585789 ","Keywords":"chronic immobilization stress\r\ninflammation\r\nmelatonin\r\noxidative biomarkers\r\nvitamin C\r\nzinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fatima S, Zaidi SS, Alsharidah AS, Aljaser FS, and Banu N (2020) Possible Prophylactic Approach for SARS-CoV-2 Infection by Combination of Melatonin, Vitamin C and Zinc in Animals..

METHODS: Both a computerized (Medline) and a manual search of the literature were performed. RESULTS: In a substantial proportion of patients with affective disorders a prodromal phase can be identified. Most patients report residual symptoms despite successful treatment. Residual symptoms upon remission have a strong prognostic value. There appears to be a relationship between residual and prodromal symptomatology (the rollback phenomenon). CONCLUSIONS: Appraisal of subclinical symptomatology in mood disorders has important implications for pathophysiological models of disease and relapse prevention. In depression, specific treatment of residual symptoms may improve long-term outcome, by acting on those residual symptoms that progress to become prodromes of relapse. In bipolar disorder, decrease of subclinical fluctuations and improvement of level of functioning by specific therapeutic strategies may add to the benefits provided by lithium prophylaxis.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fava GA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/s0033291798007429 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology\r\n*Depressive Disorder/drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/physiopathology\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System/physiopathology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fava GA (1999) Subclinical symptoms in mood disorders: pathophysiological and therapeutic implications..

Lithium is an effective therapy for BD, but only 30%-40% of patients are fully responsive. Preclinical models show that lithium alters circadian rhythms. However, it is unknown if the circadian rhythm effects of lithium are essential to its therapeutic properties. METHODS: In secondary analyses of a multi-center, prospective, trial of lithium for BD, we examined the relationship between circadian rhythms and therapeutic response to lithium. Using standardized instruments, we measured morningness, diurnal changes in mood, sleep, and energy (circadian rhythm disturbances) in a cross-sectional study of 386 BD subjects with varying lithium exposure histories. Next, we tracked symptoms of depression and mania prospectively over 12 weeks in a subset of 88 BD patients initiating treatment with lithium. Total, circadian, and affective mood symptoms were scored separately and analyzed. RESULTS: Subjects with no prior lithium exposure had the most circadian disruption, while patients stable on lithium monotherapy had the least. Patients who were stable on lithium with another drug or unstable on lithium showed intermediate levels of disruption. Treatment with lithium for 12 weeks yielded significant reductions in total and affective depression symptoms. Lithium responders (Li-Rs) showed improvement in circadian symptoms of depression, but non-responders did not. There was no difference between Li-Rs and nonresponders in affective, circadian, or total symptoms of mania. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to lithium is associated with reduced circadian disruption. Lithium response at 12 weeks was selectively associated with the reduction of circadian depressive symptoms. We conclude that stabilization of circadian rhythms may be an important feature of lithium's therapeutic effects.

However, at that time there was a lack of knowledge about how to administer and monitor lithium therapy safely and properly. The lithium clinics in Dresden and Berlin were remarkably similar in their beginnings in the late 1960s regarding patient numbers and scientific expertise without being aware of one another due to the Iron Curtain separating Germany into a western and eastern part until 1990. In what were initially lithium-care programs run independently from one another, the lithium clinics embedded in academic settings in Dresden and Berlin represent a milestone in the history of psychopharmacological treatment of affective disorders in Germany and trailblazers for today's lithium therapy. Nowadays, lithium's clinical applications are unquestioned, such as its use in strategies to prevent mood episodes and suicide, and to treat depression. The extensively documented knowledge of lithium treatment is the fruit of more than 50 years of observing disease courses and of studying side effects and influencing factors of lithium prophylaxis. Its safe and proper administration-in determining the correct indication, baseline and follow-up examinations, recommended dosages, monitoring, or the management of side effects-is well established. Subsequently, both national and international guidelines continue recommending lithium as the gold standard in treating patients with unipolar and bipolar disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Felber W ; Bauer M ; Lewitzka U ; Müller-Oerlinghausen B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1055/a-0633-3450 ","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/history/*therapeutic use\r\nGermany\r\nHistory, 20th Century\r\nHistory, 21st Century\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Chloride/*history/*therapeutic use\r\nMood Disorders/*drug therapy/history/psychology\r\nSuicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Felber W, Bauer M, Lewitzka U, and Müller-Oerlinghausen B (2018) Lithium Clinics in Berlin and Dresden: a 50-Year Experience..

Clinicians need to determine the most appropriate and effective interventions for patients who do not benefit from first-line treatment. A systematic review of the literature on augmentation strategies for major depression was conducted. A total of 32 eligible studies were included in the final review. Identified augmentation strategies included lithium, thyroid hormone, buspirone, stimulant drugs (methylphenidate and modafinil), and atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, and risperidone). Additional studies used other augmentation strategies (yohimbine, atomoxetine, inositol, testosterone, and lamotrigine), or combinations with a second antidepressant (mianserin, mirtazapine, and desipramine). There was no evidence of clinical efficacy as measured by response in augmentation with buspirone, testosterone, methylphenidate, yohimbine, inositol, and atomoxetine. Although some studies of combined antidepressant therapy and lithium augmentation did show statistically significant clinical effects, results were inconsistent across studies. The only eligible study of thyroid augmentation was positive, though this study evaluated patients treated with tricyclic antidepressants. It is possible due to small sample sizes, that some of the trials failed to detect significant differences versus placebo because of inadequate statistical power. Adjunctive therapy with atypical antipsychotics showed higher response rates compared with antidepressant monotherapy and placebo but also had more withdrawals due to adverse events. Given ongoing concerns with the longer term tolerability and safety of the atypical antipsychotics, future research will need to investigate optimal duration of augmentation therapy in patients with major depressive disorder who do not respond to first line therapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fleurence R ; Williamson R ; Jing Y ; Kim E ; Tran QV ; Pikalov AS ; Thase ME ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fleurence R, Williamson R, Jing Y, Kim E, Tran QV, Pikalov AS, and Thase ME (2009) A systematic review of augmentation strategies for patients with major depressive disorder..

METHODS: This multicenter study was conducted in 4 French cities. MDD was defined with the section L of the MINI. Unremitted MDD was defined by current antidepressant treatment and current MDD. RESULTS: 700 subjects, mean aged 38 years and 82.5% men were included: 55.4% were diagnosed with MDD but only 10.4% were administered antidepressants. Violent victimization in the past 6 months, alcohol use disorder and current substance abuse disorder were associated with increased rates of MDD. 71.2% antidepressant-treated subjects were unremitted. BD diagnosis and substance abuse disorder were found to be associated with increased risk of unremitted MDD. BD-MDD patients were found to be twice more frequently administered antidepressants than SZ-MDD ones, however the non-remission rates were higher in BD subjects compared to SZ. No antidepressant class and no specific antipsychotic or mood stabilizer has been associated with higher or lower rates of remitted MDD. CONCLUSION: MDD seems to be highly prevalent, underdiagnosed and undertreated in BD and SZ homeless subjects. Beyond antidepressants, add-on strategies including complementary agents, lithium, lamotrigine/carbamazepine or anti-inflammatory drugs and the specific care of alcohol and substance use disorders may be recommended to improve the prognosis of this specific population in addition to other interventions including housing and resocialization. Violent victimization is also frequent and should be specifically prevented in this vulnerable population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fond G ; Tinland A ; Boucekine M ; Girard V ; Loubière S ; Boyer L ; Auquier P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.109877 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/epidemiology/psychology/therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*epidemiology/*psychology/therapy\r\nFemale\r\nIll-Housed Persons/*psychology\r\nHousing/standards/*trends\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/therapeutic use\r\nRemission Induction/methods\r\nSchizophrenia/epidemiology/therapy\r\nSchizophrenic Psychology\r\n*Severity of Illness Index\r\nAntidepressant\r\nBipolar disorders, homelessness\r\nMajor depression\r\nSchizophrenia","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fond G, Tinland A, Boucekine M, Girard V, Loubière S, Boyer L, and Auquier P (2020) Improving the treatment and remission of major depression in homeless people with severe mental illness: The multicentric French Housing First (FHF) program..

More recently, based on findings from translational research, lithium has also been regarded as a neuroprotective agent and a candidate drug for disease-modification in certain neurodegenerative disorders, namely, Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and, more recently, Parkinson's disease (PD). The putative neuroprotective effects of lithium rely on the fact that it modulates several homeostatic mechanisms involved in neurotrophic response, autophagy, oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial function. Such a wide range of intracellular responses may be secondary to two key effects, that is, the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) and inositol monophosphatase (IMP) by lithium. In the present review, we revisit the neurobiological properties of lithium in light of the available evidence of its neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties, and discuss the rationale for its use in the treatment and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Forlenza OV ; De-Paula VJ ; Diniz BS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1021/cn5000309 ","Keywords":"Alzheimer Disease/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nAnimals\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nNeurodegenerative Diseases/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAlzheimer’s disease\r\nGSK-3β\r\nLithium\r\nParkinson’s disease\r\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis\r\nautophagy\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nneuroprotection","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Forlenza OV, De-Paula VJ, and Diniz BS (2014) Neuroprotective effects of lithium: implications for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders..

The aim of the present study is to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of OABD receiving lithium therapy, using data from the Global Ageing & Geriatric Experiments in Bipolar Disorder (GAGE-BD). EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES: Cross-sectional analysis of the GAGE-BD dataset to determine differences and similarities between lithium users and non-users. We analysed data from 986 participants aged 50 years or older (mean age 63.5 years; 57.5% females) from 12 study sites. Two subgroups ('Lithium'; 'Non-lithium') were defined according to the current prescription of lithium. We compared several outcomes between these groups, controlling for age, gender, and study site. RESULTS: OABD treated with lithium had lower scores on depression rating scales and were less likely to be categorised as with moderate or severe depression. There was a lower proportion of lithium users than non-users among those with evidence of rapid cycling and non-bipolar psychiatric diagnoses. Assessment of global cognitive state and functionality indicated better performance among lithium users. The current use of antipsychotics was less frequent among lithium users, who also reported fewer cardiovascular comorbidities than non-users. CONCLUSION: We found several potentially relevant differences in the clinical profile of OABD treated with lithium compared with those treated with other mood stabilisers. However, the interpretation of the present results must take into account the methodological limitations inherent to the cross-sectional approach and data harmonisation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Forlenza OV ; Hajek T ; Almeida OP ; Beunders AJM ; Blumberg HP ; Briggs FBS ; De-Paula VJR ; Dols A ; Eyler LT ; Forester BP ; Gildengers A ; Jimenez E ; Korten NCM ; Lafer B ; McWhinney SR ; Mulsant B ; Rej S ; Sarna K ; Schouws S ; Sutherland A ; Tsai S ; Vieta E ; Yala J ; Sajatovic M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/acps.13474 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\n*Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nDemography\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nlithium\r\nolder adults\r\npharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Forlenza OV, Hajek T, Almeida OP, Beunders AJM, Blumberg HP, Briggs FBS, De-Paula VJR, Dols A, Eyler LT, Forester BP, Gildengers A, Jimenez E, Korten NCM, Lafer B, McWhinney SR, Mulsant B, Rej S, Sarna K, Schouws S, Sutherland A, Tsai S, Vieta E, Yala J, and Sajatovic M (2022) Demographic and clinical characteristics of lithium-treated older adults with bipolar disorder..

METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines were conducted. Major electronic databases were searched from inception to May 2017 to assess the incidence and prevalence rates and clinical features associated with manic switch among bipolar depressed patients receiving antidepressants, using meta-regression and subgroup analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 10 098 depressed patients with bipolar disorder (BD) across 51 studies/arms were included in the quantitative analysis. The cumulative incidence of cases (TEM(+) ) among 4767 patients with BD over 15 retrospective studies was 30.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 19.6-45.0%, I(2 ) = 97.9%). The cumulative incidence of TEM(+) among 1929 patients with BD over 12 prospective open studies was 14.4% (95% CI 7.4-26.1%, I(2 ) = 93.7%). The cumulative incidence of TEM(+) among 1316 patients with BD over 20 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was 11.8% (95% CI 8.4-16.34%, I(2 ) = 73.46%). The pooled prevalence of TEM(+) among 2086 patients with BD over four cross-sectional studies was 30.9% (95% CI 18.1-47.4%, I(2 ) = 95.6%). Overall, concurrent lithium therapy predicted the lowest TEM rates. Inconsistent operational definitions of TEM were recorded, and the lack of information about age, sex, co-occurring anxiety, and other clinically relevant moderators precluded further stratification of the results. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of TEM vary primarily depending on study setting, which is concordant with the high degree of heterogeneity of the included records. Forthcoming RCT studies should adopt consistent operational definitions of TEM and broaden the number of moderators, in order to contribute most effectively to the identification of clear-cut sub-phenotypes of BD and patient-tailored pharmacotherapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fornaro M ; Anastasia A ; Novello S ; Fusco A ; Solmi M ; Monaco F ; Veronese N ; De Berardis D ; de Bartolomeis A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/bdi.12612 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology\r\n*Depression/diagnosis/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nIncidence\r\nPrevalence\r\nantidepressant\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nincidence\r\nmeta-analysis\r\nswitch\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fornaro M, Anastasia A, Novello S, Fusco A, Solmi M, Monaco F, Veronese N, De Berardis D, and de Bartolomeis A (2018) Incidence, prevalence and clinical correlates of antidepressant-emergent mania in bipolar depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis..

Depression has been linked with psychomotor disengagement, oxidative stress burden and decreased blood levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In our study we performed the experimental investigation of VRT, magnesium and of their association on the rats' endurance capacity, motor behavior and blood biological disturbances in rats subjected to forced exercise in treadmill test. Materials and Methods: The substances were administered orally for 14 consecutive days, as follows: group 1 (control): distilled water 0.3 mL/100 g body; group 2 (Mg): magnesium chloride 200 mg/kg body; group 3 (VRT): VRT 20 mg/kg body; group 4 (VRT+Mg): VRT 20 mg/kg body + magnesium chloride 200 mg/kg body. Magnesium was used as positive control substance with known effects in treadmill test. The consequences of VRT treatment on glucose, cortisol, BDNF and oxidative stress biomarkers (superoxide-dismutase, malondialdehyde, glutathione-peroxidase, lactate dehydrogenase) were also assessed. Results and conclusions: The use of VRT resulted in an improvement in motor capacity and an increase of the rats' endurance to physical effort. The administration of VRT increased the serum BDNF levels and reduced the oxidative stress in rats subjected to physical effort. The association of magnesium potentiated the effects of VRT on physical performances, the antioxidant activity and the decreasing in serum stress markers in treadmill test in rats.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fotache PA ; Mititelu-Tartau L ; Bogdan M ; Buca BR ; Pavel LL ; Pelin AM ; Meca AD ; Tartau CG ; Popa GE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/medicina58101363 ","Keywords":"Rats\r\nAnimals\r\n*Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor\r\nVortioxetine/pharmacology\r\n*Magnesium\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAntioxidants\r\nMagnesium Chloride\r\nHydrocortisone\r\nSuperoxides\r\nGlutathione Peroxidase\r\nMalondialdehyde\r\nOxidative Stress\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBiomarkers\r\nGlutathione\r\nPhysical Functional Performance\r\nGlucose\r\nLactate Dehydrogenases\r\nWater\r\nBDNF\r\nbrain-derived neurotrophic factor\r\nmagnesium chloride\r\nrats\r\ntreadmill test\r\nvortioxetine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fotache PA, Mititelu-Tartau L, Bogdan M, Buca BR, Pavel LL, Pelin AM, Meca AD, Tartau CG, and Popa GE (2022) Magnesium Potentiates the Vortioxetine's Effects on Physical Performances and Biological Changes in Exercise-Induced Stress in Rats..

MATERIAL AND METHOD: The MEDLINE was searched with the combination of each one of the key words 'mania', 'manic', 'bipolar', 'manic-depression', 'manic-depressive' with 'treatment guidelines'. RESULTS: The search was updated until March 1st, 2004 and returned 224 articles. Twenty-seven papers concerning the publication of treatment algorithms were traced. DISCUSSION: Despite supposedly being evidence-based, guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder vary significantly across committees or working groups. Overall, however, at the first stage of the mania/hypomania algorithm, monotherapy with lithium, divalproex sodium or olanzapine is generally recommended. At latter stages combination therapy is strongly recommended. It is clearly stated that in bipolar depression antidepressants should be used only in combination with antimanic agents in order to avoid switching of phases. During the maintenance phase all patients should receive antimanic agents, while some may need the addition of antidepressants. The most recent guidelines emphasize the use of atypical antipsychotics for mania and lamotrigine for depression. The main problem with guidelines is that they are rapidly outdated and that the evidence base relies mainly on registration monotherapy trials that hardly reflect treatment in routine clinical conditions. CONCLUSION: Treatment guidelines may be useful to avoid non-evidence-based treatment decisions, but they are quickly out-of-date and may not fully apply to the clinical setting. The more recent guidelines point the value of atypical antipsychotics, lithium, and valproate in the treatment of mania; the role of lithium, lamotrigine, and olanzapine as options for maintenance therapy; and the scarcity of options for the treatment of bipolar depression. Psychoeducation is also supported by most guidelines as an adjunctive treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fountoulakis KN ; Vieta E ; Sanchez-Moreno J ; Kaprinis SG ; Goikolea JM ; Kaprinis GS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2005.01.004 ","Keywords":"*Algorithms\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine\r\nHumans\r\n*Practice Guidelines as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fountoulakis KN, Vieta E, Sanchez-Moreno J, Kaprinis SG, Goikolea JM, and Kaprinis GS (2005) Treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder: a critical review..

METHODS: This article summarizes the current status of our knowledge and practice of its treatment. RESULTS: It is widely accepted that lithium is moderately useful during all phases of bipolar illness and it might possess a specific effectiveness on suicidal prevention. Both first and second generation antipsychotics are widely used and the FDA has approved olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone and aripiprazole for the treatment of acute mania. These could also be useful in the treatment of bipolar depression, but only limited data exists so far to support the use of quetiapine monotherapy or the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination. Some, but not all, anticonvulsants possess a broad spectrum of effectiveness, including mixed dysphoric and rapid-cycling forms. Lamotrigine may be effective in the treatment of depression but not mania. Antidepressant use is controversial. Guidelines suggest their cautious use in combination with an antimanic agent, because they are supposed to induce switching to mania or hypomania, mixed episodes and rapid cycling. CONCLUSION: The first-line psychosocial intervention in BD is psychoeducation, followed by cognitive-behavioral therapy. Other treatment options include Electroconvulsive therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation. There is a gap between the evidence base, which comes mostly from monotherapy trials, and clinical practice, where complex treatment regimens are the rule.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fountoulakis KN ; Vieta E ; Siamouli M ; Valenti M ; Magiria S ; Oral T ; Fresno D ; Giannakopoulos P ; Kaprinis GS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1744-859X-6-27 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fountoulakis KN, Vieta E, Siamouli M, Valenti M, Magiria S, Oral T, Fresno D, Giannakopoulos P, and Kaprinis GS (2007) Treatment of bipolar disorder: a complex treatment for a multi-faceted disorder..

RECENT FINDINGS: Our knowledge about lithium solidly supports its usefulness during all phases of bipolar illness and its specific effectiveness on suicidal prevention. Specific second-generation antipsychotics could constitute a promising option for treating bipolar depression, although only limited data exist so far. Anticonvulsants appear to possess a broad spectrum of effectiveness, including mixed dysphoric and rapid-cycling forms. Lamotrigine may be preferably effective in the treatment of depression but not mania. The usefulness of antidepressants in bipolar depression is controversial. The first line of psychosocial intervention in bipolar depression is psychoeducation, family-focused psychoeducation and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Electroconvulsive therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation are options for refractory patients. Accumulated knowledge so far indicates that bipolar patients need continuous administration of an antimanic agent even during the acute depressive phase. SUMMARY: The development of rationalized 'combination treatment' guidelines is essential today, as it seems that the vast majority of patients do poorly on monotherapy and need complex pharmacotherapies. Although our knowledge is indeed limited, the development of some kind of guidelines for polypharmacy is possible and should be done as soon as possible.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fountoulakis KN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/YCO.0b013e328333e132 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*therapy\r\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine/*trends\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fountoulakis KN (2010) An update of evidence-based treatment of bipolar depression: where do we stand?.

The literature suggests that lithium, first and second generation antipsychotics and valproate and carbamazepine are efficacious in the treatment of acute mania. Quetiapine and the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination are also efficacious for treating bipolar depression. Antidepressants should only be used in combination with an antimanic agent, because they can induce switching to mania/hypomania/mixed states/rapid cycling when utilized as monotherapy. Lithium, olanzapine, quetiapine and aripiprazole are efficacious during the maintenance phase. Lamotrigine is efficacious in the prevention of depression, and it remains to be clarified whether it is also efficacious for mania. There is some evidence on the efficacy of psychosocial interventions as an adjunctive treatment to medication. Electroconvulsive therapy is an option for refractory patients. In acute manic patients who are partial responders to lithium/valproate/carbamazepine, adding an antipsychotic is a reasonable choice. The combination with best data in acute bipolar depression is lithium plus lamotrigine. Patients stabilized on combination treatment might do worse if shifted to monotherapy during maintenance, and patients could benefit with add-on treatment with olanzapine, valproate, an antidepressant, or lamotrigine, depending on the index acute phase. A variety of treatment options for BP are available today, but still unmet needs are huge. Combination therapy may improve the treatment outcome but it also carries more side-effect burden.

CONCEPT AND STRUCTURE OF THE GUIDELINES: The current clinical guidelines are based on evidence-based data, but they also intend to be clinically useful, while a rigid algorithm was developed on the basis of firm evidence alone. Monotherapy was prioritized over combination therapy. There are separate recommendations for each of the major phases of bipolar disorder expressed as a 5-step algorithm. DISCUSSION: The current International College of Neuro-Psychopharmacology clinical guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder are the most up-to-date guidance and are as evidence based as possible. They also include recommendations concerning the use of psychotherapeutic interventions, again on the basis of available evidence. This adherence of the workgroup to the evidence in a clinically oriented way helped to clarify the role of specific antidepressants and traditional agents like lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine. The additional focus on specific clinical characteristics, including predominant polarity, mixed features, and rapid cycling, is also a novel approach. Many issues need further studies, data are sparse and insufficient, and many questions remain unanswered. The most important and still unmet need is to merge all the guidelines that concern different phases of the illness into a single one and in this way consider BD as a single unified disorder, which is the real world fact. However, to date the research data do not permit such a unified approach.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fountoulakis KN ; Grunze H ; Vieta E ; Young A ; Yatham L ; Blier P ; Kasper S ; Moeller HJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/ijnp/pyw109 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nClinical Trials as Topic/methods/*standards\r\n*Guidelines as Topic\r\nHumans\r\nPsychopharmacology/*methods/*standards\r\nanticonvulsants\r\nantidepressants\r\nantipsychotics\r\nbipolar depression\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nclinical trials\r\nevidence-based guidelines\r\nlithium\r\nmania\r\nmood stabilizers\r\ntreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fountoulakis KN, Grunze H, Vieta E, Young A, Yatham L, Blier P, Kasper S, and Moeller HJ (2017) The International College of Neuro-Psychopharmacology (CINP) Treatment Guidelines for Bipolar Disorder in Adults (CINP-BD-2017), Part 3: The Clinical Guidelines..

The PRISMA method was followed to search the MEDLINE for Randomized Controlled trials, Post-hoc analyses and Meta-analyses and review papers up to August 1st 2020, with the combination of the words 'bipolar', 'manic', 'mania', 'manic depression' and 'manic depressive' and 'randomized'. Trials and meta-analyses concerning the use of lithium either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents in adults were identified concerning acute mania (Ν=64), acute bipolar depression (Ν=78), the maintenance treatment (Ν=73) and the treatment of other issues (N = 93). Treatment guidelines were also identified. Lithium is efficacious for the treatment of acute mania including concomitant psychotic symptoms. In acute bipolar depression it is efficacious only in combination with specific agents. For the maintenance phase, it is efficacious as monotherapy mainly in the prevention of manic while its efficacy for the prevention of depressive episodes is unclear. Its combinations increase its therapeutic value. It is equaly efficacious in rapid and non-rapid cycling patients, in concomitant obsessive-compulsive symptoms, alcohol and substance abuse, the neurocognitive deficit, suicidal ideation and fatigue The current systematic review provided support for the usefulness of lithium against a broad spectrum of clinical issues in Bipolar disorder. Its efficacy is comparable to that of more recently developed agents.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fountoulakis KN ; Tohen M ; Zarate CA Jr; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.euroneuro.2021.10.003 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use\r\nMania\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nLithium\r\nSystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fountoulakis KN, Tohen M, and Zarate CA Jr (2022) Lithium treatment of Bipolar disorder in adults: A systematic review of randomized trials and meta-analyses..

These were arrived at through the statistical aggregation of the survey responses of 61 leading clinical researchers to eight questions about the key decision points in the management of bipolar depression. The experts' first-line recommendation for treating psychotic depression in bipolar disorder is to provide a combination of mood stabilizer, antidepressant, and neuroleptic medication. For severe, but nonpsychotic bipolar depression, the experts recommend the combination of a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant. For milder bipolar depression, a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant together or a mood stabilizer alone would be first line. The experts' antidepressant dose and dosing schedule recommendations are equivalent for unipolar and bipolar depression, but the experts recommend a faster discontinuation of antidepressants during the maintenance phase in bipolar patients--probably to reduce the risk of rapid cycling. Among the antidepressants, the experts prefer bupropion and the serotonin reuptake inhibitors as first line. They also believe that bupropion is least likely among antidepressants to cause switches to mania. Among mood stabilizers, the experts rate lithium as most likely to have a direct antidepressant effect.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Frances AJ ; Kahn DA ; Carpenter D ; Docherty JP ; Donovan SL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Algorithms\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/chemically induced/*drug therapy\r\nBupropion/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nConfidence Intervals\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nPractice Guidelines as Topic\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use\r\nTranquilizing Agents/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Frances AJ, Kahn DA, Carpenter D, Docherty JP, and Donovan SL (1998) The Expert Consensus Guidelines for treating depression in bipolar disorder..

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to assess prescribing of evidence-based therapies for patients discharged between November 2007 and August 2010 with a diagnosis code of BPD at the time of discharge. The primary objective of the study was to determine if evidence-based medications were prescribed at the time of discharge. Secondary objectives included analysis of other medications used, concomitant disease states and drug therapy, rate of readmission, and rate of therapeutic drug monitoring. RESULTS: Of 294 patients, 170 (58%) were prescribed evidence-based medications upon discharge. The most commonly used medication was quetiapine. The most commonly prescribed off-label medications were atypical antipsychotics. For patients on antipsychotics, rates of appropriate monitoring were variable. Seventy percent of patients receiving lithium had a therapeutic concentration prior to discharge. Differences in rates of readmission between groups were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of prescribing evidence-based medications at discharge for patients with BPD were low. Additionally, evidence-based monitoring for specific medications was variable. Future studies reviewing treatment course and illness severity may provide more information about appropriate medication use in patients with BPD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Freeland KN ; Cogdill BR ; Ross CA ; Sullivan CO ; Drayton SJ ; VandenBerg AM ; Short EB ; Garrison KL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2146/sp150023 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*psychology\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine/*standards/trends\r\nFemale\r\nHospitals, Psychiatric/standards/trends\r\nHumans\r\nInpatients/*psychology\r\nMale\r\nMedication Adherence/*psychology\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPatient Discharge/standards/trends\r\nPractice Guidelines as Topic/*standards\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Freeland KN, Cogdill BR, Ross CA, Sullivan CO, Drayton SJ, VandenBerg AM, Short EB, and Garrison KL (2015) Adherence to evidence-based treatment guidelines for bipolar depression in an inpatient setting..

METHOD: Twenty-seven patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for acute manic episodes underwent a 3-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-groups trial of treatment with lithium carbonate or valproate. Symptom severity was measured by using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, change version (SADS-C), the Global Assessment Scale (GAS), and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Drug effects were compared by using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: At the end of the study, nine of 14 patients treated with valproate and 12 of 13 patients treated with lithium had responded favorably, as measured by changes in the SADS-C mania, BPRS, and GAS scores. Elevated pretreatment SADS-C depression scores were associated with good response to valproate. ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between drug and mixed affective state with respect to treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: Lithium and valproate were both effective in improving manic symptoms, and lithium was slightly more efficacious overall. Unlike the case with lithium, favorable response to valproate was associated with high pretreatment depression scores. Therefore, treatment with valproate alone may be particularly effective in manic patients with mixed affective states.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Freeman TW ; Clothier JL ; Pazzaglia P ; Lesem MD ; Swann AC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/ajp.149.1.108 ","Keywords":"Analysis of Variance\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nValproic Acid/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Freeman TW, Clothier JL, Pazzaglia P, Lesem MD, and Swann AC (1992) A double-blind comparison of valproate and lithium in the treatment of acute mania..

While Mg's effects on motor and cognitive deficits following TBI have been well studied, few studies have addressed post-traumatic depression as an outcome parameter, despite its being a major clinical problem with an incidence of between 6 and 77%. We investigated the incidence of post-traumatic depression/anxiety in an animal model of diffuse TBI, and explored the use of magnesium sulfate (MgSO(4)) as an interventional treatment. METHODS: Diffuse TBI was induced in 32 anesthetized, adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats, using the 2 m impact-acceleration model of injury. At 30 min after injury, half of the rats received 250 micromol/kg i.v. MgSO(4); the other half served as non-treated controls. Before and for 6 weeks after injury, the open-field, spontaneous activity test was used to determine post-traumatic depression/anxiety relative to pre-injury. In this test, animals are placed in a 1-meter square box with 100 squares marked on the base. The number of squares entered in a 5-min period is recorded. Incidence of post-traumatic depression/anxiety was defined as the number of animals demonstrating a reduction in spontaneous activity to less than 100 squares in 5 min. Prior to injury, rats typically entered a mean of 201 +/- 12 (SEM) squares over a 5 min observation period. RESULTS: At 1 week after injury, non-treated animals had a mean core of 62 +/- 13. The incidence of post-traumatic depression/anxiety in these animals was 61%, which is similar to that observed clinically. In contrast, animals treated with MgSO(4) had a mean activity score of 144 +/- 23 at 1 week after TBI and an incidence of depression/anxiety of less than 30%. The significant difference between groups persisted for the entire 6-week observation period. CONCLUSIONS: The improvement in post-traumatic depression/anxiety conferred by Mg adds further weight to available evidence of Mg's benefit as a neuroprotective agent after TBI.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fromm L ; Heath DL ; Vink R ; Nimmo AJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/07315724.2004.10719396 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrain Injuries/*complications/metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nMagnesium/*metabolism\r\nMagnesium Sulfate/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMotor Activity\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nRecovery of Function/drug effects\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fromm L, Heath DL, Vink R, and Nimmo AJ (2004) Magnesium attenuates post-traumatic depression/anxiety following diffuse traumatic brain injury in rats..

A retrospective study was conducted on outpatients with affective disorder from 1991 to 1992 at Okayama University Medical School to select cases of RCAD. The subjects were 35 patients who fulfilled DSM-III-R criteria for mood disorder and had experienced at least four episodes of illness during the previous year. The subjects were divided into two groups according to their age at the first phase of affective illness: an early-onset group, consisting of patients aged 25 years or younger, and a late-onset group, consisting of patients aged 26 or older. There were 14 patients in the early-onset group and 21 in the late-onset group. Both the mean duration from onset to rapid cycling and the mean duration of each phase were shorter in the early-onset group than in the late-onset group. There were no significant differences between the groups in period of remission, character of the first episode, heredity, or thyroid function. Lithium carbonate therapy was more effective for reducing manic symptoms in the late-onset group than in the early-onset group, without maintaining a prophylactic effect in either group, whereas carbamazepine was more effective in the early-onset group. Antidepressants used in the depressive phase had a tendency to be more effective in the late-onset than in the early-onset group. However, rapid cycling induced by antidepressants was more evident in the late-onset than in the early-onset group. These findings supported the differentiation of RCAD into two groups based on age at onset, the early-onset group showing a rapid cycling course at an early stage and a good response to carbamazepine, the late-onset group having a relatively long disease duration until the appearance of a rapid cycling course and a good response to lithium carbonate in the manic phase and to antidepressants in the depressive phase.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fujiwara Y ; Honda T ; Tanaka Y ; Aoki S ; Kuroda S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00004714-199808000-00005 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics\r\nCarbamazepine/*therapeutic use\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fujiwara Y, Honda T, Tanaka Y, Aoki S, and Kuroda S (1998) Comparison of early- and late-onset rapid cycling affective disorders: clinical course and response to pharmacotherapy..

With regard to the treatment of specific disorders in children and adolescents, the most significant developments have been the examination of the tricyclics for the treatment of depression and the initiation of controlled studies for the treatment of Tourette syndrome. Unfortunately, the findings from the depression studies have been uniformly negative, and the results of research on both depression and tic disorders show a relatively high rate of placebo responsivity, which raises nagging questions about the role of case reports and open trials. Another important trend in pediatric psychopharmacotherapy is the search for substitutes for the neuroleptics. Potential candidates include agents such as lithium, naltrexone, fenfluramine, clonidine, and carbamazepine. The most underresearched disorders are a combination of the least common (e.g. schizophrenia, mania) and those that are apparently perceived as less serious (e.g. sleep disorders, certain anxiety disorders). Not surprisingly, the most studied disorder and treatment is hyperactivity and stimulant medication, respectively. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the social implications of the associated symptoms and their response to stimulant drugs, aided greatly by the use of direct observation procedures. Researchers are beginning to attend to the implications of comorbidity for assessing response to medication. There has been additional confirmation of efficacy of stimulant treatment for preschoolers and adolescents. Dose-response issues remain to some extent unresolved, the primary impediments being interpretive misconceptions associated with trend analysis, an overreliance on the syndromal perspective and too little attention to target behaviors and their clinical implications, and the failure to operationalize the minimal effective dose with regard to the normalization and supranormalization of target and collateral behaviors. Disagreement over whether hyperactivity is a learning or a behavior disorder (or both) and what academic underproductivity means clinically and socially is also impeding progress. With regard to developmental disorders, controlled studies indicate that fenfluramine and naltrexone are effective for managing associated symptoms in some individuals. However, given the limited amount of research on these agents, their status as clinically useful palliatives must be considered tentative.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gadow KD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1469-7610.1992.tb00861.x ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAutistic Disorder/drug therapy\r\nChild\r\nChild, Preschool\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDevelopmental Disabilities/drug therapy\r\nFeeding and Eating Disorders/drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfant\r\nLearning Disabilities/drug therapy\r\nMale\r\nMental Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gadow KD (1992) Pediatric psychopharmacotherapy: a review of recent research..

METHODS: From June 2011 to December 2016, patients with bipolar I or II disorder (using DSM-IV diagnostic criteria) and CGI-S (Clinical Global Impression-Severity) ⩾ 3 were randomized to receive lithium or divalproex monotherapy for 2 weeks. Patients who had CGI-S-depression ⩾ 3 for 2 weeks at any time after 2-week monotherapy were randomly assigned to receive quetiapine or lamotrigine, or remaining on monotherapy for a total of 26 weeks. RESULTS: The rates of early termination due to lack of efficacy and side effects and changes in BISS (Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale) and CGI-S total score were not significantly different between lithium and divalproex. The completion rate was significantly higher with adjunctive therapy than with monotherapy. BISS and CGI-S total scores, and their sub-scores were significantly reduced with adjunctive therapy compared to monotherapy. Adjunctive therapy significantly increased survival times compared to monotherapy (hazard ratio = 6.8), and the monotherapy group had a significantly increased risk for not reaching sustained recovery from depression (hazard ratio = 12.7). Patients who did not need the 2nd randomization and remained on monotherapy had a significantly reduced hazard for discontinuation (hazard ratio = 3.8). CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of lithium and divalproex as monotherapy was modest. Adjunctive lamotrigine and quetiapine to either one was well-tolerated and equally effective in reducing bipolar symptomatology, but adjunctive therapy should be initiated as early as possible when depression symptoms are present.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gao K ; Arnold JG ; Prihoda TJ ; Quinones M ; Singh V ; Schinagle M ; Conroy C ; D'Arcangelo N ; Bai Y ; Calabrese JR ; Bowden CL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"*Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLamotrigine/therapeutic use\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nQuetiapine Fumarate\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nValproic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ndivalproex\r\nlamotrigine\r\nlithium\r\nquetiapine\r\nsequential treatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gao K, Arnold JG, Prihoda TJ, Quinones M, Singh V, Schinagle M, Conroy C, D'Arcangelo N, Bai Y, Calabrese JR, and Bowden CL (2020) Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Treatment (SMART) for Bipolar Disorder at Any Phase of Illness and at least Mild Symptom Severity..

Recent studies have shown that ketamine may increase the potential risk of treatment-induced mania in MDD patients. Lithium is a well-known mood stabilizer and has been widely used for the treatment of mania. It is not fully understood which forebrain regions are involved in ketamine- and lithium-induced expression of c-Fos. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the effect of chronic lithium treatment on mania-like behavior and c-Fos expression in the mouse forebrain activated by a single administration of ketamine. In the open field test, our results showed that ketamine significantly increased the total distance and total cumulative duration of movement in mice, while chronic lithium could attenuate these effects of ketamine. In addition, acute ketamine induced higher c-Fos expression in the lateral septal nucleus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus of mice in the treatment group compared to those in the control group. However, chronic lithium inhibited the significant increase in c-Fos-immunoreactive neurons following acute ketamine administration in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, field CA1 of the hippocampus, dorsal subiculum, ventral subiculum, ventral subiculum, central amygdaloid nucleus and basolateral amygdaloid nucleus. In summary, our research shows that pretreatment with lithium moderates the effects of acute ketamine administration on mania-like behavior and c-Fos expression in the forebrain. These findings could be helpful in better understanding the episodes of mania related to ketamine treatment for MDD and bipolar disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gao TH ; Ni RJ ; Liu S ; Tian Y ; Wei J ; Zhao L ; Wang Q ; Ni P ; Ma X ; Li T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pbb.2021.173108 ","Keywords":"Amygdala/metabolism\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects\r\nAntimanic Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nHippocampus/*metabolism\r\nHyperkinesis/chemically induced\r\nKetamine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects\r\nLithium Compounds/*administration & dosage\r\nMale\r\nMania/*chemically induced/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nNeurons/drug effects/metabolism\r\nProto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/*metabolism\r\nSignal Transduction/*drug effects\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nAmygdala\r\nHippocampus\r\nHypothalamus\r\nKetamine\r\nLateral septal nucleus\r\nLithium","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gao TH, Ni RJ, Liu S, Tian Y, Wei J, Zhao L, Wang Q, Ni P, Ma X, and Li T (2021) Chronic lithium exposure attenuates ketamine-induced mania-like behavior and c-Fos expression in the forebrain of mice..

Moreover, the chronic stress and its associated secondary malnutrition cause a variable depression on immunity, whose pathogenesis has been related to the excessive production of cytokines and glucocorticoids. When stressful stimuli are excessive, animals increment their anorexia and express a progressively installed wasting syndrome, associated with hypozincemia and susceptibility to infections with high mortality rate. In this work, chronically stressed mice were studied to observe the prophylactic effect of a zinc treatment on the evolution of both their malnutrition and their immune competence. Stress was induced in newborn Balb/c mice by intraperitoneal (IP) injections with heat-killed bacteria for 4 weeks. Following this inductive period, almost all the stressed mice showed a transient wasting syndrome characterized by anorexia, deficient gain of corporal weight, diarrhea, skin infection, reduced antibody response against antigens of red blood sheep cells, and a decreased proliferative response in their Con-A stimulated splenic lymphocytes. However, when the stressed mice received an additional IP treatment with zinc acetate, their clinical condition showed a significant improvement and their immunocompetence was similar to that exhibited by non-stressed mice from the control groups. The results suggest that zinc supplementation can ameliorate the effects of chronic stress on the growth, corporal weight, and immunocompetence of young mice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"García Tamayo F; Terrazas Valdés LI; Malpica López N; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnimals, Newborn\r\nBody Weight/drug effects\r\nCachexia/etiology/*prevention & control\r\nChronic Disease\r\nFemale\r\nImmunocompetence/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred BALB C\r\nNutrition Disorders/etiology\r\nStaphylococcal Infections/complications\r\nStress, Physiological/*complications\r\nZinc/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"García Tamayo F, Terrazas Valdés LI, and Malpica López N (1996) Zinc administration prevents wasting in stressed mice..

It results from psychosocial stress, polypathology, as well as some biochemical changes which occur in the aged brain and can lead to cognitive impairments, increased symptoms from medical illness, higher utilization of health care services and increased rates of suicide and nonsuicide mortality. Therefore, it is very important to make an early diagnosis and a suitable pharmacological treatment, not only for resolving the acute episode, but also for preventing relapse and enhancing the quality of life. Age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and in pharmacodynamics have to be kept into account before prescribing an antidepressant therapy in an old patient. In this paper some of the most important and tolerated drugs in the elderly are reviewed. Tricyclic antidepressants have to be used carefully for their important side effects. Nortriptyline, amytriptiline, clomipramine and desipramine as well, seem to be the best tolerated tricyclics in old people. Second generation antidepressants are preferred for the elderly and those patients with heart disease as they have milder side effects and are less toxic in overdose and include the so called atypicals, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin noradrenalene reuptake inhibitors and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are useful drugs in resistant forms of depression in which the above mentioned drugs have no efficacy; the last generation drugs (reversible MAO inhibitors), such as meclobemide, seem to be very successful. Mood stabilizing drugs are widely used for preventing recurrences of depression and for preventing and treating bipolar illness. They include lithium, which is sometimes used especially to prevent recurrence of depression, even if its use is limited in old patients for its side effects, the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproic acid. Putative last generation mood stabilizing drugs include the dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel blockers and the anticonvulsants phenytoin, lamotrigine, gabapentin and topiramate, which have unique mechanisms of action and also merit further systematic study. Psychotherapy is often used as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy, while electroconvulsant therapy is used only in the elderly patients with severe depression, high risk of suicide or drug resistant forms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gareri P ; Falconi U ; De Fazio P ; De Sarro G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0301-0082(99)00050-7 ","Keywords":"Affect/drug effects\r\nAged/*physiology\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nIncidence\r\nLiver/drug effects/enzymology\r\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nPrevalence\r\nReceptors, Adrenergic/metabolism\r\nReceptors, Dopamine/metabolism\r\nReceptors, GABA-B/metabolism\r\nReceptors, Serotonin/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gareri P, Falconi U, De Fazio P, and De Sarro G (2000) Conventional and new antidepressant drugs in the elderly..

Most people improve over time, but two thirds may have residual dysfunction, and at least 40% may have recurrent episodes. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in people with mania associated with bipolar disorder? What are the effects of treatments in bipolar depression? What are the effects of interventions to prevent relapse of mania or bipolar depression? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to July 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 60 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Overall, advances in drug treatment remain quite modest. Antipsychotic drugs are effective in the acute treatment of mania; their efficacy in the treatment of depression is variable with the clearest evidence for quetiapine. Despite their widespread use, considerable uncertainty and controversy remains about the use of antidepressant drugs in the management of depressive episodes. Lithium has the strongest evidence for long-term relapse prevention; the evidence for anticonvulsants such as divalproex and lamotrigine is less robust and there is much uncertainty about the longer term benefits of antipsychotics. Substantial progress has been made in the development and assessment of adjunctive psychosocial interventions. Long-term maintenance and possibly acute stabilisation of depression can be enhanced by the combination of psychosocial treatments with drugs. The development of future treatments should consider both the neurobiological and psychosocial mechanisms underlying the disorder. We should continue to repurpose treatments and to recognise the role of serendipity. We should also investigate optimum combinations of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments at different stages of the illness. Clarification of the mechanisms by which different treatments affect sleep and circadian rhythms and their relation with daily mood fluctuations is likely to help with the treatment selection for individual patients. To be economically viable, existing psychotherapy protocols need to be made briefer and more efficient for improved scalability and sustainability in widespread implementation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Geddes JR ; Miklowitz DJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60857-0 ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/psychology/*therapy\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nPractice Guidelines as Topic\r\nPsychotherapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Geddes JR, and Miklowitz DJ (2013) Treatment of bipolar disorder..

This disorder involves periodic episodes of mania and depression. At least 80 percent of patients who have an initial episode of mania will have one or more subsequent episodes. Because recurring episodes have a cumulative deteriorative effect on functioning and treatment response, the sooner bipolar patients are diagnosed and treated, the better their changes are for recovery. With optimal treatment, a bipolar patient can regain approximately 7 years of life, 10 years of effective major activity, and 9 years of normal health, which otherwise would have been lost due to the illness. For treatment purposes, bipolar disorder is divided into three stages: acute mania, acute depression, and maintenance. Lithium is the standard treatment for acute mania, and its effectiveness is solidly supported by experimental evidence. Rigorous studies over the past 40 years involving hundreds of patients have repeatedly shown the efficacy of lithium therapy, with approximately 80 percent of subjects responding favorably. For those who do not, several other drugs and nonpharmacologic therapies are available that have shown high success rates in well-standardized trials. The anticonvulsant drug carbamazepine has been associated with improved symptoms in approximately 60 percent to 70 percent of subjects in double-blind trials comparing it against placebo, neuroleptics, and/or lithium. Valproate, another anticonvulsant, has been shown to be comparable to lithium and superior to placebo in treating acute mania in several double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is another effective treatment for acute mania, with a positive response rate of approximately 80 percent. Acute bipolar depression has been successfully treated with a number of agents, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., tranylcypromine), lithium, tricyclic antidepressants, and second-generation antidepressants (e.g., bupropion). Nonpharmacologic approaches such as ECT, sleep deprivation, and light therapy have been effective as supplemental therapy in many patients. For maintenance therapy, lithium is again the drug of choice. Clinical research has shown that maintenance lithium lessens the frequency and severity of episodes of mania and depression in bipolar patients and helps stabilize mood between episodes. Long-term lithium treatment also reduces the risk of mortality for bipolar patients: without treatment, mortality is two to three times higher than that of the general population; with treatment, it is not significantly different. Several other drugs have been studied as alternatives or adjuncts to lithium therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gelenberg AJ ; Hopkins HS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy/therapy\r\nHumans\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gelenberg AJ, and Hopkins HS (1993) Report on efficacy of treatments for bipolar disorder..

In general, lithium is superior in stabilizing mood and ideation, whereas neuroleptics are better in controlling hyperactivity, and the course of clinical response is faster to antipsychotics than to lithium. The effects of neuroleptics on bipolar depression need further study. Traditional neuroleptics carry the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, and concern exists over neurotoxicity from the combination of lithium and a neuroleptic. Roles for clozapine, risperidone, and newer atypical neuroleptics, which may carry a lower risk of associated extrapyramidal side effects, will become clear with additional study and clinical experience. Long-term antipsychotic therapy in the maintenance phase of bipolar disorder is common; the efficacy, however, remains unclear and the risk of tardive movement disorders is substantial. Otherwise treatment-resistant patients who receive maintenance antipsychotic therapy to prevent recurrent episodes of mania should be followed closely, with regular screening for early signs of movement disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gelenberg AJ ; Hopkins HS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Acute Disease\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/prevention & control/psychology\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy/prevention & control/psychology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nRisperidone/therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gelenberg AJ, and Hopkins HS (1996) Antipsychotics in bipolar disorder..

Of the numerous agents that possess antidepressant activity, some have a more narrow therapeutic window for the old (lithium), while others may be more efficacious for the old than traditional tricyclics (stimulants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors). Stimulants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors require close monitoring to obviate complications, and this limits their use in this population. Prescription of the more common reuptake inhibitors in this age group can be based on consideration of efficacy and especially predictable incidence of side effects. Efficacy of all the reuptake inhibitors is essentially equivalent over 4 weeks, if the patient can tolerate treatment. Antidepressants with many side effects are, thus, less efficacious if we consider only whether the patient will be better 4 weeks after we start treatment since drop outs must be considered treatment failures for that particular treatment. Side effects are more clearly different among the antidepressants with demonstrably fewer cardiac effects (i.e. ECG changes, orthostatic hypotension) for buproprion, mianserin, nomifensine, and trazodone in the geriatric group compared to older agents such as amitriptyline and imipramine. Further, anticholinergic effects in the periphery (dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and urinary hesitancy) and centrally (confusion, sedation, decreased memory recall) are substantially less with several of the newer antidepressants: buproprion, maprotiline, nomifensine and trazodone.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gerner RH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/0165-0327(85)90085-0 ","Keywords":"Age Factors\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nKinetics\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nMethylphenidate/therapeutic use\r\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gerner RH (1985) Present status of drug therapy of depression in late life..

This change in comparison with previous APA guidelines has been criticized, especially from some groups in Europe. The Munich group in particular has published a critique of assumptions underlying the conservative recommendations of the recent APA treatment guidelines. In this paper, we re-examine the argument put forward by the Munich group, and we demonstrate that indeed, conceptually and empirically, there is a strong rationale for a cautious approach to antidepressant use in bipolar disorder, consistent with, and perhaps even more strongly than, the APA guidelines. This rationale is based on support for the following four propositions: (i) The risk of antidepressant induced mood-cycling is high, (ii) Antidepressants have not been shown to definitively prevent completed suicides and reduce mortality, whereas lithium has, (iii) Antidepressants have not been shown to be more effective than mood stabilizers in acute bipolar depression and have been shown to be less effective than mood stabilizers in preventing depressive relapse in bipolar disorder and (iv) Mood stabilizers, especially lithium and lamotrigine, have been shown to be effective in acute and prophylactic treatment of bipolar depressive episodes. We therefore draw three conclusions from this interpretation of the evidence: (i) There are significant risks of mania and long-term worsening of bipolar illness with antidepressants, (ii) Antidepressants should generally be reserved for severe cases of acute bipolar depression and not routinely used in mild to moderate cases and (iii) Antidepressants should be discontinued after recovery from the depressive episode, and maintained only in those who repeatedly relapse after antidepressant discontinuation (a minority we judge to represent only about 15-20% of bipolar depressed patients).","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ghaemi SN ; Hsu DJ ; Soldani F ; Goodwin FK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1046/j.1399-5618.2003.00074.x ","Keywords":"Affect/drug effects\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/chemically induced/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/therapeutic use\r\nPractice Guidelines as Topic\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nRisk\r\nSecondary Prevention\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ghaemi SN, Hsu DJ, Soldani F, and Goodwin FK (2003) Antidepressants in bipolar disorder: the case for caution..

Two previous algorithms for unipolar nonpsychotic depression were published in 1993 and 1998. New studies over the last 20 years suggest that another update is needed. METHODS: The references reviewed for the previous algorithms were reevaluated, and a new literature search was conducted to identify studies that would either support or alter the previous recommendations. Other guidelines and algorithms were consulted. We considered exceptions to the main algorithm, as for pregnant women and patients with anxious distress, mixed features, or common medical and psychiatric comorbidities. SUMMARY: For inpatients with severe melancholic depression and acute safety concerns, electroconvulsive therapy (or ketamine if ECT refused or ineffective) may be the first-line treatment. In the absence of an urgent indication, we recommend trialing venlafaxine, mirtazapine, or a tricyclic antidepressant. These may be augmented if necessary with lithium or T3 (triiodothyronine). For inpatients with non-melancholic depression and most depressed outpatients, sertraline, escitalopram, and bupropion are reasonable first choices. If no response, the prescriber (in collaboration with the patient) has many choices for the second trial in this algorithm because there is no clear preference based on evidence, and there are many individual patient considerations to take into account. If no response to the second medication trial, the patient is considered to have a medication treatment-resistant depression. If the patient meets criteria for the atypical features specifier, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor could be considered.

Dysregulation of both hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic CRF systems have been reported in patients with major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Moreover, effective treatment of these conditions leads to normalization of these CRF systems. Although there is virtually no data concerning alterations of CRF systems in bipolar disorder (manic depressive illness), previous work indicates that valproic acid, an anticonvulsant also effective in the treatment of acute mania, alters central CRF neuronal systems. In the current studies, we chronically administered valproic acid and lithium, two clinically effective mood stabilizers, in nonstressed rats to extend our previous findings. Chronic valproic acid administration decreased CRF mRNA expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus; lithium administration increased CRF mRNA expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala. Although valproic acid increased CRF(1) receptor mRNA expression in the cortex, CRF(1) receptor binding was decreased in both the basolateral amygdala and cortex, suggesting that chronic valproate treatment may in fact dampen the overall tone in this central stress pathway. Valproate treatment decreased CRF(2A) mRNA expression in both the lateral septum and hypothalamus, although CRF(2A) receptor binding was unchanged. Lithium administration decreased CRF(1) mRNA expression in both the amygdala and frontal cortex, but CRF(1) receptor binding also remained unchanged. These results suggest that the therapeutic actions of these mood stabilizers may, in part, result from their actions on central CRF neuronal systems. The distinct actions of each drug on CRF systems may underlie their synergistic clinical effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gilmor ML ; Skelton KH ; Nemeroff CB ; Owens MJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1124/jpet.102.045419 ","Keywords":"Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/metabolism\r\nAnimals\r\nAntimanic Agents/*pharmacology\r\nAutoradiography\r\nCorticosterone/metabolism\r\nCorticotropin-Releasing Hormone/biosynthesis/metabolism/*physiology\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/drug effects\r\nImage Processing, Computer-Assisted\r\nIn Situ Hybridization\r\nLithium Carbonate/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nNeurons/*drug effects\r\nRNA, Messenger/biosynthesis\r\nRadioimmunoassay\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nUrocortins\r\nValproic Acid/*pharmacology\r\nWeight Gain/drug effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gilmor ML, Skelton KH, Nemeroff CB, and Owens MJ (2003) The effects of chronic treatment with the mood stabilizers valproic acid and lithium on corticotropin-releasing factor neuronal systems..

Despite a general reduction in the use of lithium over the past several years, it is effective in the management of both manic and depressive episodes in BD and continues to be recommended as a first-line mood stabilizer. This review provides an overview of the pharmacology of lithium and highlights its clinical profile in the management of BD, focusing on the potential advantages of prolonged-release (PR) versus immediate-release (IR) formulations of lithium. A literature search using PubMed was performed to identify articles describing IR and PR lithium in BD using specific search terms like 'lithium', 'prolonged-release', 'sustained-release', 'extended-release', 'bipolar disorder', 'adherence' and 'compliance'. Relevant pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data were also included. Several clinical trials suggested that lithium is effective in the treatment of acute mania and prophylaxis of BD and reduces the risk of suicide in patients with BD; it may also be used in combination with other drugs in the treatment of bipolar depression. Treatment with lithium must be monitored to avoid lithium-associated toxicity. The prolonged PR formulation of lithium has several advantages including consistent serum lithium concentrations, fewer adverse events and improved adherence to therapy. Although direct comparative studies between PR and IR formulations of lithium are primarily limited to pharmacokinetic studies, PR formulation of lithium provides potential advantages over IR formulation and can be effectively used in the management of BD with lesser adverse events.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Girardi P ; Brugnoli R ; Manfredi G ; Sani G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s40268-016-0139-7 ","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations\r\n*Drug Compounding\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Girardi P, Brugnoli R, Manfredi G, and Sani G (2016) Lithium in Bipolar Disorder: Optimizing Therapy Using Prolonged-Release Formulations..

Established first-line treatments include lithium, valproate and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) in acute mania, and lithium and valproate as maintenance treatments. Recently validated treatments include extended release carbamazapine for acute mania and lamotrigine, olanzapine and aripiprazole as maintenance treatments. For treatment-resistant mania and as maintenance treatments, a number of newer anticonvulsants, and one older one, phenytoin, have shown some promise as effective. However, not all anticonvulsants are effective and each agent needs to be evaluated individually. Combining multiple agents is the most commonly used clinical strategy for treatment resistant bipolar patients despite a relative lack of data supporting its use, except for acute mania (for which lithium or valproate plus an SGA is optimal treatment). Other approaches that may be effective for treatment-resistant patients include high-dose thyroid augmentation, clozapine, calcium channel blockers and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Adjunctive psychotherapies show convincing efficacy using a variety of different techniques, most of which include substantial attention to education and enhancing coping strategies. Only recently, bipolar depression has become a topic of serious inquiry with the dominant controversy focusing on the place of antidepressants in the treatment of bipolar depression. Other than mood stabilizers alone or the combination of mood stabilizers and antidepressants, most of the approaches for treatment-resistant bipolar depression are relatively similar to those used in unipolar depression, with the possible exception of a more prominent place for SGAs, prescribed either alone or in combination with antidepressants. Future work in the area needs to explore the treatments commonly used by clinicians with inadequate research support, such as combination therapy and the use of antidepressants as both acute and adjunctive maintenance treatments for bipolar disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gitlin M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/sj.mp.4001793 ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*therapy\r\n*Drug Resistance\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Chloride/therapeutic use\r\nPsychotherapy\r\nReproducibility of Results\r\nSocial Adjustment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gitlin M (2006) Treatment-resistant bipolar disorder..

The authors review the data on maintenance treatments in bipolar disorder, highlighting the controlled trial literature. METHODS: Literature review using PubMed, Medline, and a hand search of relevant literature. RESULTS: Over the last decade, a number of effective maintenance treatments for bipolar disorder have been developed with an evidence base for second-generation antipsychotics and some anticonvulsants. Increasing numbers of patients, therefore, are appropriately treated with multiple medications as a maintenance regimen. For some medications, maintenance treatment has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials for both monotherapy and in combination with other mood stabilizers. Lithium continues as our oldest well-established maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder with somewhat better efficacy in preventing mania than depression. Lamotrigine, olanzapine, and quetiapine have bimodal efficacy in preventing both mania and depression, although lamotrigine's efficacy is more robust in preventing depression and olanzapine's efficacy is greater in preventing mania. Aripiprazole, ziprasidone, and risperidone long-acting injection all prevent mania, but not depression. Less controlled investigations have suggested some evidence of maintenance mood stabilization with carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and adjunctive psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the number of agents with demonstrated efficacy as maintenance treatments in bipolar disorder, optimal treatment regimens are still a combination of evidence-based therapy in combination with individualized creative treatment algorithms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gitlin M ; Frye MA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1399-5618.2012.00992.x ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gitlin M, and Frye MA (2012) Maintenance therapies in bipolar disorders..

Unfortunately, many patients fail to respond adequately to this agent or are unable to tolerate its adverse effects. Divalproex has become a commonly used alternative to lithium, but it also is ineffective or poorly tolerated in many patients. This article attempts to review the available data on maintenance therapy in bipolar disorder with a variety of anticonvulsants and antipsychotics (both conventional and novel), with reference to relevant studies in acute mania and bipolar depression as well. METHODS: Evidence on maintenance therapy and relevant acute-phase data were collected using MEDLINE database searches. RESULTS: Data on maintenance therapy with agents other than lithium and divalproex are sparse, and often derived from open, uncontrolled studies. Implications and flaws of available data are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Other than lithium, there are few robust double-blind data to support the use of a variety of agents in the maintenance phase.

The illness commonly starts in young adults and is a leading cause of disability and premature mortality. The clinical manifestations of bipolar disorder can be markedly varied between and within individuals across their lifespan. Early diagnosis is challenging and misdiagnoses are frequent, potentially resulting in missed early intervention and increasing the risk of iatrogenic harm. Over 15 approved treatments exist for the various phases of bipolar disorder, but outcomes are often suboptimal owing to insufficient efficacy, side effects, or lack of availability. Lithium, the first approved treatment for bipolar disorder, continues to be the most effective drug overall, although full remission is only seen in a subset of patients. Newer atypical antipsychotics are increasingly being found to be effective in the treatment of bipolar depression; however, their long term tolerability and safety are uncertain. For many with bipolar disorder, combination therapy and adjunctive psychotherapy might be necessary to treat symptoms across different phases of illness. Several classes of medications exist for treating bipolar disorder but predicting which medication is likely to be most effective or tolerable is not yet possible. As pathophysiological insights into the causes of bipolar disorders are revealed, a new era of targeted treatments aimed at causal mechanisms, be they pharmacological or psychosocial, will hopefully be developed.

There are several types of therapeutic strategies to improve inadequate response to antidepressant treatment. The first step for patients with TRD is to optimize the dosage and duration of antidepressants as well as to ensure their drug compliance. The shift to antidepressant and antidepressant combination therapy for patients with TRD cannot be regarded as an evidence-based strategy. Only the combination of a monoamine reuptake inhibitor with a presynaptic α2-autoreceptor antagonist might have better efficacy than other antidepressant combinations. Currently, the most evidence-based treatment options for TRD are augmentation strategies. Among augmentative agents, second-generation antipsychotics and lithium have the strongest evidence for the management of TRD. Further studies are needed to evaluate the augmentative efficacy of anticonvulsants, thyroid hormone, glutamatergic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, and nutraceuticals for TRD. Among somatic therapies, electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation are effective for TRD. Further studies are warranted to provide clinicians with a better recommendation in making treatment choices in patients with TRD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Goh KK ; Chang SC ; Chen CH ; Lu ML ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1381612826666200110101604 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\n*Electroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nTreatment-resistant depression\r\nanticonvulsant\r\nantidepressant\r\nantipsychotics\r\nbrain stimulation\r\nlithium\r\nnutraceutical.","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Goh KK, Chang SC, Chen CH, and Lu ML (2020) Therapeutic Strategies for Treatment-resistant Depression: State of the Art and Future Perspectives..

Because a substantial number of patients with bipolar disorder present with an index depressive episode, it is likely that many are misdiagnosed with unipolar major depression. Even if a correct diagnosis is made, depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder are notoriously difficult to treat. Patients are often treated with antidepressants, which, if used improperly, are known to induce mania and provoke rapid cycling. This article explores diagnostic conundrums in bipolar depression and their possible solutions, based on current research evidence. It also elucidates current evidence regarding the risks and benefits associated with antidepressant use and evaluates alternative treatment regimens for the depressed bipolar population, including the use of traditional mood stabilizers such as lithium, novel anticonvulsants such as lamotrigine, and atypical antipsychotics.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Goldberg JF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00131746-200305000-00002 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Goldberg JF (2003) When do antidepressants worsen the course of bipolar disorder?.

METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study examined 2712 inpatients with a DSM-IV clinical diagnosis of BP to assess associations between complex polypharmacy (defined as ≥4 psychotropics) and demographic and clinical features; associations with risk of rehospitalization were also examined. Logistic regressions were performed with the sample as a whole and with each of four DSM-IV BP subtypes individually. RESULTS: Complex polypharmacy was present in 21.0%. BP-I depressed patients were more likely to receive complex regimens than BP-I manic, BP-I mixed or BP-II patients. In the sample as a whole, variables significantly associated with complex polypharmacy included female, white, psychotic features and a co-diagnosis of borderline personality, post-traumatic stress or another anxiety disorder. The only examined medication not significantly associated with complex polypharmacy was lithium, although only in BP-I depressed and BP-I mixed. Complex polypharmacy was associated with rehospitalization in BP-I mania within 15 and 30days post index hospitalization. LIMITATIONS: All data were from one clinical facility; results may not generalize to other settings and patient populations. CONCLUSIONS: BP-I depression may pose a greater treatment challenge than the other BP subtypes. Lithium may confer an overall advantage compared to other medications in BP-I depressed and BP-I mixed. Further research is needed to guide pharmacotherapy decisions in BP patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Golden JC ; Goethe JW ; Woolley SB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2017.06.005 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAffect/drug effects\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInpatients/*psychology\r\nLogistic Models\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Polypharmacy\r\nProspective Studies\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use\r\nYoung Adult\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nPharmacotherapy\r\nPolypharmacy\r\nRehospitalization","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Golden JC, Goethe JW, and Woolley SB (2017) Complex psychotropic polypharmacy in bipolar disorder across varying mood polarities: A prospective cohort study of 2712 inpatients..

Rats were exposed to mild unpredictable stress for 3 weeks as a depression model. The combinations of drug and supplements were applied via daily gavage for 4 weeks. The open field test was conducted to observe behavioral changes. A chemiluminescence method was used to detect folacin, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used to detect serum elements. Supplementation of zinc and folic acid significantly improved behavior responses to paroxetine, including movement speed, total distance, and central zone frequency. In addition, higher calcium and copper levels and a lower arsenic level were found in the serum of the MZnFP group. Thus, supplementation of zinc and folacin can enhance the anti-depressive effect of paroxetine, and the mechanism is potentially related to the improved levels of calcium and copper and a reduced level of arsenic.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gong A ; Wan D ; Liang H ; Yan L ; Yu Z ; Zhang H ; Wang Q ; Dou M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neulet.2020.135270 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nArsenic/*blood\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBone and Bones/*drug effects\r\nCalcium/*blood\r\nCopper/*blood\r\nFolic Acid/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nParoxetine/*pharmacology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nZinc/*pharmacology\r\nArsenic\r\nCalcium\r\nDepression\r\nFolic acid\r\nParoxetine\r\nZinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gong A, Wan D, Liang H, Yan L, Yu Z, Zhang H, Wang Q, and Dou M (2020) Joint replenishment of zinc and folic acid enhances the anti-depressive effect of paroxetine via increasing serum calcium and copper and decreasing serum arsenic..

Serum zinc was measured by flame atomic absorption (Varian AA240FS) and the mean zinc intake was assessed using 3-day food record. A validated Persian version of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to determine the severity of depressive symptoms for all subjects. Data were analyzed using SPSS 18 software. There was a statistically significant correlation between dietary zinc intake and serum zinc concentration (r = 0.117, p = 0.018). Dietary intake of zinc (7.04 ± 4.28 mg/day) was significantly lower among subjects with mild to severe depression symptoms than those with no or minimal depression symptoms (8.06 ± 3.03 mg/day). Dietary zinc intake was inversely correlated with depression score (r = 0.133, p = 0.008). However, there was no significant difference in serum zinc concentrations among individuals with no or minimal and mild to severe depression symptoms (p = 0.5). Dietary zinc intake, but not serum zinc concentration, was inversely associated with depression symptoms. Therefore, controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy of zinc supplementation in the treatment of depression disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gonoodi K ; Moslem A ; Ahmadnezhad M ; Darroudi S ; Mazloum Z ; Tayefi M ; Tabatabaeizadeh SA ; Eslami S ; Shafiee M ; Khashayarmanesh Z ; Haghighi HM ; Ferns GA ; Ghayour-Mobarhan M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s12011-018-1301-6 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nChild\r\nDepression/*blood/drug therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIran\r\nSoftware\r\nZinc/*administration & dosage/*blood/therapeutic use\r\nAdolescence\r\nDepression\r\nSerum zinc\r\nZinc intake","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gonoodi K, Moslem A, Ahmadnezhad M, Darroudi S, Mazloum Z, Tayefi M, Tabatabaeizadeh SA, Eslami S, Shafiee M, Khashayarmanesh Z, Haghighi HM, Ferns GA, and Ghayour-Mobarhan M (2018) Relationship of Dietary and Serum Zinc with Depression Score in Iranian Adolescent Girls..

This exploratory study examines differences in lithium response and treatment outcomes in Hispanics, African Americans, and non-Hispanic whites with bipolar disorder in the Lithium Treatment Moderate Dose Use Study (LiTMUS). METHODS: LiTMUS was a six-site randomized controlled trial of low-dose lithium added to optimized treatment (OPT; personalized, evidence-based pharmacotherapy) vs. OPT alone in outpatients with bipolar disorder. Of 283 participants, 47 African Americans, 39 Hispanics, and 175 non-Hispanic whites were examined. We predicted minority groups would have more negative medication attitudes and higher attrition rates, but better clinical outcomes. RESULTS: African Americans in the lithium group improved more on depression and life functioning compared to whites over the 6 month study. African Americans in the OPT only group had marginal improvement on depression symptoms. For Hispanics, satisfaction with life did not significantly improve in the OPT only group, in contrast to whites and African Americans who improved over time on all measures. Attitudes toward medications did not differ across ethnic/racial groups. CONCLUSIONS: African Americans show some greater improvements with lithium than non-Hispanic whites, and Hispanics showed more consistent improvements in the lithium group. The impact of low-dose lithium should be studied in a larger sample as there may be particular benefit for African Americans and Hispanics. Given that the control group (regardless of ethnicity/race) had significant improvements, optimized treatment may be beneficial for any ethnic group.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gonzalez Arnold J; Salcedo S ; Ketter TA ; Calabrese JR ; Rabideau DJ ; Nierenberg AA ; Bazan M ; Leon AC ; Friedman ES ; Iosifescu D ; Sylvia LG ; Ostacher M ; Thase M ; Reilly-Harrington NA ; Bowden CL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2015.02.035 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBlack or African American/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data\r\nAntimanic Agents/*administration & dosage\r\n*Attitude\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nHispanic or Latino/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data\r\nHumans\r\nKaplan-Meier Estimate\r\nLithium Compounds/*administration & dosage\r\nMale\r\nProspective Studies\r\nWhite People/statistics & numerical data\r\nAfrican Americans\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nHealth disparities\r\nHispanics\r\nLithium\r\nTreatment outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gonzalez Arnold J, Salcedo S, Ketter TA, Calabrese JR, Rabideau DJ, Nierenberg AA, Bazan M, Leon AC, Friedman ES, Iosifescu D, Sylvia LG, Ostacher M, Thase M, Reilly-Harrington NA, and Bowden CL (2015) An exploratory study of responses to low-dose lithium in African Americans and Hispanics..

METHODS: We examined the association of suicidal acts with adherence to long-term lithium maintenance treatment and other potential risk factors in 72 BP I patients followed prospectively for up to 10 years at a Mood Disorders Research Center in Spain. RESULTS: The observed rates of suicide were 0.143, and of attempts, 2.01%/year, with a 5.2-fold (95% CI: 1.5-18.6) greater risk among patients consistently rated poorly versus highly adherent to lithium prophylaxis (11.4/2.2 acts/100 person-years). Treatment non-adherence was associated with substance abuse, being unmarried, being male, and having more hypomanic-manic illness and hospitalizations. Suicidal risk was higher with prior attempts, more depression and hospitalization, familial mood disorders, and being single and younger, as well as treatment non-adherence, but with neither sex nor substance abuse. In multivariate analysis, suicidal risk was associated with previous suicidality > poor treatment adherence > more depressive episodes > younger age. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support growing evidence of lower risk of suicidal acts during closely monitored and highly adherent, long-term treatment with lithium and indicate that treatment adherence is a potentially modifiable factor contributing to antisuicidal benefits.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gonzalez-Pinto A ; Mosquera F ; Alonso M ; López P ; Ramírez F ; Vieta E ; Baldessarini RJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1399-5618.2006.00368.x ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*epidemiology/psychology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPatient Compliance/*statistics & numerical data\r\nPrevalence\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSuicide, Attempted/psychology/*statistics & numerical data\r\nTime Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gonzalez-Pinto A, Mosquera F, Alonso M, López P, Ramírez F, Vieta E, and Baldessarini RJ (2006) Suicidal risk in bipolar I disorder patients and adherence to long-term lithium treatment..

The excess mortality appears primarily to result from suicide; any excess mortality from physical illness, most notably cardiovascular disease, now appears unlikely to be a simple consequence of affective illness. Historical comparisons suggest that acute treatment of affective disorder reduces the immediate risk of death. It is much more difficult to assess the impact of treatment upon the subsequent rates of suicide. This is true of all aspects of the acute and short-term continuation of treatment for an episode of illness, from the need for hospital admission to the choice of drug treatment. Adequate treatment of refractory depression and the possibility that some actions of drugs may increase the risks of suicide are emergent therapeutic issues that are still providing more questions than answers. Prophylaxis should also reduce the risk of suicide. However, although standardized mortality rates, reflecting relative risk, are very high, only ∼2% of patients with affective disorder will commit suicide in a follow-up interval of 2 years. Comparison of mortality data for patients on lithium registers with that from lithium clinics shows important reductions in specialized clinics. Indeed, mortality from suicide may actually be lower than expected. It raises the question of whether long- term hospital follow-up by personnel with a specialist interest in drug treatment of major mental illness is safer than a potentially more erratic provision of care in the community. The future issues in the prevention of suicide include whether to treat patients by admission to a hospital in-patient unit or not, whether to treat for at least a year with adequate doses of tricyclic drugs or a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) re-uptake inhibitor, and whether to maintain patients with a second episode of affective illness or a prolonged first illness indefinitely with lithium or antidepressants.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Goodwin GM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0269881192006002051 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Goodwin GM (1992) The effects of treatment on mortality in affective illness..

However, for the most important issue, prophylaxis of episodes, lithium has more evidence of efficacy than any other agent. Like lithium, typical antipsychotics, carbamazepine, divalproex, and the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine are effective in the treatment of mania. Carbamazepine, divalproex, and olanzapine seem effective in preventing manic episodes but, like lithium, are less effective in preventing depression. Few trials have been conducted in the more difficult-to-treat characteristics of bipolar disorder, specifically, rapid cycling and break-through depression. For patients with rapid cycling, carbamazepine or divalproex therapy may improve symptoms, but only lamotrigine has been shown to reduce cycling, mostly in the bipolar II group, in a randomized, placebo-controlled study. For the treatment of depressive episodes, lithium and olanzapine have shown modest efficacy in controlled trials, and among the mood stabilizers, lamotrigine has the most robust effect. Because manic symptoms may respond best to one agent and depressive symptoms to another, combination therapy may be the optimal treatment for many patients with bipolar disorder. For example, lithium augmentation may improve overall response rates to treatment with carbamazepine or divalproex, and the lithium-lamotrigine combination should provide effective prevention of both mania and depression. Also, each mood stabilizer may be given at lower doses when given in combination, resulting in a reduced side effect burden and improved compliance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Goodwin FK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/prevention & control/psychology\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy/psychology\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Goodwin FK (2003) Rationale for using lithium in combination with other mood stabilizers in the management of bipolar disorder..

METHOD: 1315 bipolar I patients (DSM-IV) enrolled in the initial open-label phase, and 638 were stabilized and randomly assigned to 18 months of double-blind monotherapy with lamotrigine (N = 280; 50-400 mg/day fixed dose or 100-400 mg/day flexible dose), lithium (N = 167; serum level of 0.8-1.1 mEq/L), or placebo (N = 191). The primary endpoint was time from randomization to intervention for a mood episode. Data were gathered from August 1997 to August 2001. RESULTS: Lamotrigine and lithium were superior to placebo for time to intervention for any mood episode (median survival: placebo, 86 days [95% CI = 58 to 121]; lithium, 184 days [95% CI = 119 to not calculable]; lamotrigine, 197 days [95% CI = 144 to 388]). Lamotrigine was superior to placebo for time to intervention for depression (median survival: placebo, 270 days [95% CI = 138 to not calculable]; lithium, median not calculable; lamotrigine, median not calculable). Lithium and lamotrigine were superior to placebo for time to intervention for mania (median survival not calculable for any group). Results of additional analyses adjusted for index mood were similar; however, only lithium was superior to placebo for intervention for mania. There was no evidence that either active treatment caused affective switch. Adverse event analysis indicated more diarrhea (19% vs. 7%, p <.05) and tremor (15% vs. 4%, p <.05) in lithium-treated patients compared with lamotrigine-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Lamotrigine and lithium stabilized mood by delaying the time to treatment for a mood episode. Lamotrigine was effective against depression and mania, with more robust activity against depression. Lithium was effective against mania.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Goodwin GM ; Bowden CL ; Calabrese JR ; Grunze H ; Kasper S ; White R ; Greene P ; Leadbetter R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/jcp.v65n0321 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Tolerance\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLithium Carbonate/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nProspective Studies\r\nRecurrence\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nTriazines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Goodwin GM, Bowden CL, Calabrese JR, Grunze H, Kasper S, White R, Greene P, and Leadbetter R (2004) A pooled analysis of 2 placebo-controlled 18-month trials of lamotrigine and lithium maintenance in bipolar I disorder..

The other commonly used terms are \"augmentation\" which implies an additive effect from adding a second medicine to that obtained from prescribing a first, an \"add on\" which implies adding on to existing, possibly effective treatment which, for one reason or another, cannot or should not be stopped. The issues that arise in all potential indications are: a) how long it is reasonable to wait to prove insufficiency of response to monotherapy; b) by what criteria that response should be defined; c) how optimal is the dose of the first monotherapy and, therefore, how confident can one be that its lack of effect is due to a truly inadequate response? Before one considers combination treatment, one or more of the following criteria should be met; a) monotherapy has been only partially effective on core symptoms; b) monotherapy has been effective on some concurrent symptoms but not others, for which a further medicine is believed to be required; c) a particular combination might be indicated de novo in some indications; d) The combination could improve tolerability because two compounds may be employed below their individual dose thresholds for side effects. Regulators have been concerned primarily with a and, in principle at least, c above. In clinical practice, the use of combination treatment reflects the often unsatisfactory outcome of treatment with single agents. ANTIPSYCHOTICS IN MANIA: There is good evidence that most antipsychotics tested show efficacy in acute mania when added to lithium or valproate for patients showing no or a partial response to lithium or valproate alone. Conventional 2-armed trial designs could benefit from a third antipsychotic monotherapy arm. In the long term treatment of bipolar disorder, in patients responding acutely to the addition of quetiapine to lithium or valproate, this combination reduces the subsequent risk of relapse to depression, mania or mixed states compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate. Comparable data is not available for combination with other antipsychotics. ANTIPSYCHOTICS IN MAJOR DEPRESSION: Some atypical antipsychotics have been shown to induce remission when added to an antidepressant (usually a SSRI or SNRI) in unipolar patients in a major depressive episode unresponsive to the antidepressant monotherapy. Refractoriness is defined as at least 6 weeks without meeting an adequate pre-defined treatment response. Long term data is not yet available to support continuing efficacy. SCHIZOPHRENIA: There is only limited evidence to support the combination of two or more antipsychotics in schizophrenia. Any monotherapy should be given at the maximal tolerated dose and at least two antipsychotics of different action/tolerability and clozapine should be given as a monotherapy before a combination is considered. The addition of a high potency D2/3 antagonist to a low potency antagonist like clozapine or quetiapine is the logical combination to treat positive symptoms, although further evidence from well conducted clinical trials is needed. Other mechanisms of action than D2/3 blockade, and hence other combinations might be more relevant for negative, cognitive or affective symptoms. OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER: SSRI monotherapy has moderate overall average benefit in OCD and can take as long as 3 months for benefit to be decided. Antipsychotic addition may be considered in OCD with tic disorder and in refractory OCD. For OCD with poor insight (OCD with \"psychotic features\"), treatment of choice should be medium to high dose of SSRI, and only in refractory cases, augmentation with antipsychotics might be considered. Augmentation with haloperidol and risperidone was found to be effective (symptom reduction of more than 35%) for patients with tics. For refractory OCD, there is data suggesting a specific role for haloperidol and risperidone as well, and some data with regard to potential therapeutic benefit with olanzapine and quetiapine. ANTIPSYCHOTICS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS IN SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS: Cardio-metabolic risk in patients with severe mental illness and especially when treated with antipsychotic agents are now much better recognized and efforts to ensure improved physical health screening and prevention are becoming established.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Goodwin G ; Fleischhacker W ; Arango C ; Baumann P ; Davidson M ; de Hert M ; Falkai P ; Kapur S ; Leucht S ; Licht R ; Naber D ; O'Keane V ; Papakostas G ; Vieta E ; Zohar J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.euroneuro.2009.04.003 ","Keywords":"Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/classification/drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Goodwin G, Fleischhacker W, Arango C, Baumann P, Davidson M, de Hert M, Falkai P, Kapur S, Leucht S, Licht R, Naber D, O'Keane V, Papakostas G, Vieta E, and Zohar J (2009) Advantages and disadvantages of combination treatment with antipsychotics ECNP Consensus Meeting, March 2008, Nice..

It has been reported that the mechanism of antidepressants' action is involved in the glutamatergic system. Theories about the role of magnesium ions in pathophysiology of major depressive disorder include blocking the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Ketamine, NMDAR antagonist, was found to promote fast-acting antidepressant and antisuicidal effects.

Relatively low remission rates among depressive patients enforce the search for new therapeutic solutions and an urgent need to develop faster-acting antidepressants with a different mechanism of action occurs. The pathomechanism of depression postulated by the monoamine hypothesis is limited. The results of abnormalities in glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems in the brains of people with mood disorders allowed to develop new theories regarding pathophysiology of these disorders. Glutamatergic transmission is influenced by magnesium and ketamine through glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonistic effects. Magnesium and ketamine have a common mechanism of action in the treatment of depression: an increase in GluN2B (NMDAR subunit) expression is related to the administration of both of the agents, as well as inhibition of phosphorylation of eEF2 (eukaryotic elongation factor 2) in cell culture and increase of the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus. Combination of ketamine and magnesium in a normal magnesium level presents a superadditive effect in depression treatment. Analysed substances affect the GABAergic system and have anti-inflammatory effects, which is correlated with their antidepressant effect. The synergistic interaction between the pharmacodynamic activity of magnesium and ketamine may be of particular importance for patients with mood disorders. Further research is needed to determine the relationship between magnesium levels and ketamine treatment response mainly in the attempt to establish if the magnesium supplementation can change ketamine treatment response time or present superadditive effect.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Górska N ; Słupski J ; Szałach ŁP ; Włodarczyk A ; Szarmach J ; Jakuszkowiak-Wojten K ; Gałuszko-Węgielnik M ; Wilkowska A ; Wiglusz MS ; Cubała WJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nKetamine/*therapeutic use\r\nMagnesium/*therapeutic use\r\nPeptide Elongation Factor 2/metabolism\r\nReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Górska N, Słupski J, Szałach ŁP, Włodarczyk A, Szarmach J, Jakuszkowiak-Wojten K, Gałuszko-Węgielnik M, Wilkowska A, Wiglusz MS, and Cubała WJ (2019) Magnesium and ketamine in the treatment of depression..

Mood was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression rating scale (HAD), and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Micronutrient supplementation was provided for 8 weeks in a double-blinded randomised controlled trial. Significant symptoms of depression (29%) and anxiety (24%) were found at baseline. 67% of patients had low serum concentrations of vitamin C, but no-one was below the reference range for selenium. Depression was significantly associated with selenium levels, but not with folate or vitamin C levels. No individual with a HAD depression score of >or=8, had selenium levels >1.2 microM. In those patients with higher HAD depression scores, there was a significant reduction in the score and a significant increase in serum selenium levels after 8 weeks of micronutrient supplementation. Placebo group scores were unchanged. This small study concluded that depression was associated with low levels of selenium in frail older individuals. Following 8 weeks of micronutrient supplementation, there was a significant increase in selenium levels and improved symptoms of depression occurred in a subgroup.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gosney MA ; Hammond MF ; Shenkin A ; Allsup S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000131886 ","Keywords":"Affect/*drug effects\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAnxiety/*psychology\r\nAscorbic Acid/blood/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/prevention & control/psychology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nFrail Elderly/*psychology/statistics & numerical data\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMicronutrients/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nSelenium/blood/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nTrace Elements/blood/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin B Complex/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nVitamins/blood/pharmacology/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gosney MA, Hammond MF, Shenkin A, and Allsup S (2008) Effect of micronutrient supplementation on mood in nursing home residents..

However, the mechanism by which lithium exerts its antidepressant effects is unclear. Our objective was to further characterize the effects of peripheral and central administration of lithium in mouse models of antidepressant efficacy as well as to investigate the role of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors in these behaviors. We utilized the mouse forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), intracerebroventricular (ICV) lithium administration, AMPA receptor inhibitors, and BS3 crosslinking followed by Western blot. Both short- and long-term administration of lithium resulted in robust antidepressant-like effects in the mouse FST and TST. Using ICV administration of lithium, we show that these effects are due to actions of lithium on the brain, rather than to peripheral effects of the drug. Both ICV and rodent chow (0.4% LiCl) administration paradigms resulted in brain lithium concentrations within the human therapeutic range. The antidepressant-like effects of lithium in the FST and TST were blocked by administration of AMPA receptor inhibitors. Additionally, administration of lithium increased the cell surface expression of GluR1 and GluR2 in the mouse hippocampus. Collectively, these data show that lithium exerts centrally mediated antidepressant-like effects in the mouse FST and TST that require AMPA receptor activation. Lithium may exert its antidepressant effects in humans through AMPA receptors, thus further supporting a role of targeting AMPA receptors as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gould TD ; O'Donnell KC ; Dow ER ; Du J ; Chen G ; Manji HK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuropharm.2007.11.002 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage/metabolism\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBenzodiazepines/pharmacology\r\nBrain/drug effects/metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDrug Administration Routes\r\nExcitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/pharmacology\r\nExploratory Behavior/drug effects\r\nHindlimb Suspension/*methods\r\nInjections, Intraventricular/methods\r\nLithium Compounds/*administration & dosage/metabolism\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nProtein Transport/drug effects\r\nQuinoxalines/pharmacology\r\nReceptors, AMPA/*physiology\r\n*Swimming\r\nTime Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gould TD, O'Donnell KC, Dow ER, Du J, Chen G, and Manji HK (2008) Involvement of AMPA receptors in the antidepressant-like effects of lithium in the mouse tail suspension test and forced swim test..

Clinical stability was assessed at baseline with the Clinical Global Impression scale for BD and depressive symptoms with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Psychotropic medications were classified and analysed according to their mechanism as well as use. Logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between pharmacological strategies and clinical features.

It has been argued that many studies of lithium were conducted at a time when study design, assessment standards and the diagnostic criteria for patient selection were not as established as they presently are. However, recent placebo-controlled data from three-arm trials have demonstrated a definite efficacy of lithium in bipolar disorder. Regarding mania, recent trials of novel antimanic treatments (such as second-generation antipsychotics) that have included both placebo and lithium control groups have confirmed that lithium is effective in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes. The efficacy of lithium as monotherapy for acute bipolar depression is still controversial, but this therapy is recognized as a therapeutic option. For maintenance therapy, lithium is superior to placebo for the prevention of relapse or recurrence of mood episodes in bipolar I disorder patients with recent manic or hypomanic episodes. Lithium is more effective in preventing episodes of the manic/hypomanic type, including mixed episodes, than preventing depressive episodes. In rapid cycling patients, lithium improves clinical symptoms as efficiently as in nonrapid cycling persons, but is not likely to prevent recurrences. Finally, data from a number of studies suggest that lithium reduces the high suicide rates associated with mood disorders. A well designed cohort study and two independent meta-analyses are in agreement with this finding. In conclusion, most experts, and the most recent guidelines, continue to consider lithium as a keystone therapy of bipolar disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Grandjean EM ; Aubry JM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2165/00023210-200923030-00004 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/mortality/psychology\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy/psychology\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use\r\nSuicide/statistics & numerical data","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Grandjean EM, and Aubry JM (2009) Lithium: updated human knowledge using an evidence-based approach: Part I: Clinical efficacy in bipolar disorder..

While seemingly just a simple elemental compound, it has powerful treatment effects for both depression and bipolar disorder. The evidence base for treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder is relatively small, but, in recent years, additional clinical trial data have enabled lithium to re-emerge as a valuable and, in many cases, preferred treatment. Pharmacologically, lithium is complex, with varied effects at both intracellular and extracellular levels. As a treatment for bipolar disorder in pediatrics, lithium is challenging, given its narrow therapeutic window and myriad of potential side effects. However, the efficacy of lithium continues to match that of newer pharmacologic agents, and its tolerability has been shown to be comparable with more commonly prescribed medications. Lithium is still one of few drugs that have been proven to reduce the risk of suicidality, and it may have utility in illnesses beyond affective disorders. Practically, as a primary agent or as an adjunct, lithium continues to claim a rightful place in the treatment armamentarium of child psychiatry. New dosing paradigms have improved tolerability and reduced potential side effects. Recent evidence affirms that lithium is effective for pediatric bipolar disorder in multiple phases of the illness.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Grant B ; Salpekar JA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s40272-018-0289-x ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nChild\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Grant B, and Salpekar JA (2018) Using Lithium in Children and Adolescents with Bipolar Disorder: Efficacy, Tolerability, and Practical Considerations..

Morphine-sensitized rats present resilience to stress-induced behavioral deficits and, if hyporeactivity to stress models a depressive symptom, stress resistance can be regarded as a manic symptom. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that long-term lithium administration reinstates sensitivity to stress in sensitized rats. The first aim of the study was to examine the effects of carbamazepine, a standard antimanic treatment, on the stress resilience of sensitized rats, to further characterize morphine sensitization as a model of manic symptom. Carbamazepine administration abolished stress resilience but did not interfere with the expression of sensitization. The second aim of the study was to assess whether repeated carbamazepine treatment affected the dopaminergic and behavioral responses to a natural reward, a palatable food (vanilla sugar, VS), in non food-deprived sensitized and control rats and compare these possible effects with those of repeated lithium administration. Control and sensitized rats showed increased extraneuronal dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens shell after VS consumption and competence to acquire an instrumental VS-sustained appetitive behavior (VAB). Repeated carbamazepine treatment abolished the dopaminergic response to VS consumption and disrupted the competence to acquire VAB in control rats. Lithium-treated rats showed a dopaminergic response to VS and easily acquired the appetitive behavior. In sensitized rats, neither carbamazepine nor lithium administration interfered with the dopaminergic response to VS and the acquisition of VAB. In summary, the effect of carbamazepine on the stress resilience of sensitized rats further supported the hypothesis that morphine sensitization might model some symptoms of mania. Moreover, in control rats carbamazepine treatment elicited an anhedonia-like condition that clearly distinguished the effects of this drug from those of lithium.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Grappi S ; Marchese G ; Secci ME ; De Montis MG ; Gambarana C ; Scheggi S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pbb.2011.06.031 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacology\r\nAnimals\r\nAnticonvulsants/*pharmacology\r\nAntimanic Agents/*pharmacology\r\nAppetitive Behavior/drug effects\r\nBipolar Disorder/*chemically induced/*psychology\r\nBrain Chemistry/drug effects\r\nCarbamazepine/*pharmacology\r\nCentral Nervous System Sensitization/*drug effects\r\nChoice Behavior/drug effects\r\nDopamine/metabolism\r\nEscape Reaction/drug effects\r\nFood\r\nLithium Chloride/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMicrodialysis\r\nMorphine/*pharmacology\r\nNucleus Accumbens\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nResilience, Psychological/drug effects\r\nStress, Psychological/psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Grappi S, Marchese G, Secci ME, De Montis MG, Gambarana C, and Scheggi S (2011) Morphine sensitization as a model of mania: comparative study of the effects of repeated lithium or carbamazepine administration..

Due to the doubt about a sufficient efficacy of lithium expressed in recent years from various sides, and the simultaneous availability of newer treatment alternatives, this paper attempts to make a critical stocktaking of our knowledge about lithium in the acute treatment of bipolar disorders. Aspects concerning the changed disorder concept through the broadening of the bipolar spectrum, together with the available results from controlled and open studies with lithium, are presented and appraised. This shows that lithium should still be seen as an essential, but not the only corner stone in the differentiated treatment of bipolar patients. Provided that it is taken reliably and well-tolerated, lithium represents a first choice treatment, particularly for a classical course of manic-depressive illness (Bipolar I disorder), especially for mild to moderate manic syndromes.However, as antidepressive treatment, lithium should rather not be applied as a monotherapy, particularly in severe bipolar depression, since with the new generation of antidepressants and anticonvulsants well-tolerated and very effective alternatives are available. In combination treatment, lithium should be applied particularly when it has already shown good prophylactic efficacy and/or in patients for whom a high suicide risk must be presumed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Grunze H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00406-003-0427-4 ","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic/methods\r\nReview Literature as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Grunze H (2003) Lithium in the acute treatment of bipolar disorders-a stocktaking..

Supplementation with a fixed combination of these three agents (Antemig®, PiLeJe) was investigated in an observational study. METHODS: Adult patients suffering from migraine according to the criteria of the International Headache Society were enrolled by general practitioners (≥2 migraine attacks during previous month; exclusion of chronic migraine and medication overuse) and after a one-month baseline phase, supplemented with one tablet of 100 mg feverfew, 100 mg coenzyme Q10 and 112.5 mg magnesium per day for 3 months. RESULTS: Supplementation significantly reduced the number of days with migraine headache during third month of supplementation compared to baseline phase (1.3 days ±1.5 versus 4.9 days ±2.6, p < 0.0001; n = 68 intention to treat; primary criterion). The decrease was progressive over the period of supplementation and significant from first month (1st month: -2.5 days ±3.1, p < 0.0001; 2nd month: -3 days ±2.8, p < 0.0001). The proportion of patients with a reduction of at least 50% in the number of days with migraine headache was 75% (51/68) after 3 months, with a progressive increase over the period of supplementation (63.2% [43/68] after 1 month and 70.6% [48/68] after 2 months). The proportion of patients with anxiety and depressive symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) decreased between baseline phase and third month of supplementation from 61.9% (39/63 patients with information available) to 35% (21/60) for depression and from 52.4% (33/63) to 30% (18/60) for anxiety. An improvement of quality of life (Qualité de Vie et Migraine questionnaire) was also observed. The combination was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the proprietary supplement containing feverfew, coenzyme Q10 and magnesium assessed could be beneficial and safe for the prevention of migraine in adult patients and merits further study.

Methods: The study is based on retrospective chart review. Children and adolescent patients with BD and non-BD prescribed lithium in a mental health and neurological disorders hospital between 2012 and 2017 were included in the study. Data were collected from the electronic medical files. Laboratory values for WBC count, serum creatinine, and TSH levels at baseline within the week before the onset of lithium, and at 1st, 3rd, 6(th), and 12th month of treatment were recorded. Results: A total of 143 patients (82 females, 61 males; 100 BD, 43 non-BD) aged 9-18 were included. Non-BD diagnoses were psychotic and schizoaffective disorders, unipolar depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, severe mood dysregulation syndrome, borderline personality disorder, and autism. Mean age of the participants were 15.90 ± 1.16 years for the bipolar group and 14.88 ± 1.79 years for the nonbipolar group. Patients with BD reported more adverse effects. There was a statistically significant increase in WBC counts and TSH levels at any time point. A statistically significant elevation in serum creatinine was found at 3rd and 12th month of treatment. During the course of lithium treatment, WBC counts exceeded 13,000 in 14 (9.8%) patients, and TSH levels exceeded 5.5 mU/L in 41 patients (28.6%). Twenty-one (14.68%) patients were started on thyroxin replacement. Basal TSH levels and duration of the lithium treatment were higher in the participants with TSH levels exceeding 5.5 mU/L. Lithium maximum dose, lithium blood level, basal TSH level, and duration of treatment were higher in the participants receiving thyroxin replacement. No patients had serum creatinine levels exceeding the normal reference values. Conclusion: Our study suggests that lithium is a generally safe and tolerable agent for children and adolescents with BD and non-BD; however, close monitoring of thyroid functions particularly in patients with a higher basal TSH level and longer duration of lithium use is important.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Güneş H ; Tanıdır C ; Doktur H ; Karaçetin G ; Kılıçoğlu AG ; Yalçın Ö ; Bahalı MK ; Mutlu C ; Üneri ÖŞ ; Erdoğan A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1089/cap.2021.0066 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nChild\r\nCreatinine\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\n*Lithium/therapeutic use\r\nLithium Compounds/adverse effects\r\nMale\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nThyrotropin\r\n*Thyroxine\r\nTurkey\r\nadolescents\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nchildren\r\nlithium\r\nside effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Güneş H, Tanıdır C, Doktur H, Karaçetin G, Kılıçoğlu AG, Yalçın Ö, Bahalı MK, Mutlu C, Üneri ÖŞ, and Erdoğan A (2022) Long-Term Effects of Lithium Use on Children and Adolescents: A Retrospective Study from Turkey..

Since lithium shows major antisuicidal effects in bipolar disorders and in heterogeneous mood disorder samples, we evaluated evidence of antisuicidal effects of lithium in patients with recurrent MDD. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2006; search terms: lithium, suicide, affective disorder, depression, major depression, and mood disorder) for studies reporting suicides or suicide attempts during treatment with and without lithium in recurrent MDD patients, and we added data for 78 new subjects, provided from the Lucio Bini Mood Disorders Research Center in Sardinia, Italy. Suicide rates were pooled and analyzed by use of incidence-rate ratios (IRRs) and meta-analytic methods. DATA SYNTHESIS: Eight studies involved 329 MDD patients and exposure for 4.56 years (1149 person-years) with, and 6.27 years (1285 person-years) without, lithium. Overall risk of suicides and suicide attempts was 88.5% lower with vs. without lithium: 0.17%/y versus 1.48%/y (IRR = 8.71; 95% CI: 2.10 to 77.2, p = .0005); for completed suicides (85% risk reduction), IRR = 6.77 (95% CI: 1.29 to 66.8, p = .01). Meta-analysis by risk difference and risk ratio supported these findings, and sensitivity analysis yielded similar results with studies omitted serially. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first meta-analysis suggesting antisuicidal effects of lithium in recurrent MDD, similar in magnitude to that found in bipolar disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Guzzetta F ; Tondo L ; Centorrino F ; Baldessarini RJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/jcp.v68n0304 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/complications/*drug therapy/*psychology\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use\r\nRecurrence\r\nRisk Assessment\r\nSuicide, Attempted/*psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Guzzetta F, Tondo L, Centorrino F, and Baldessarini RJ (2007) Lithium treatment reduces suicide risk in recurrent major depressive disorder..

Previously, we have shown that a novel ionic co-crystal of lithium salicylate proline (LISPRO) is an improved lithium formulation compared to the carbonate or salicylate form of lithium in terms of safety and efficacy in reducing AD pathology in Alzheimer's mice. The current study is designed to compare the prophylactic effects of LISPRO, lithium carbonate (LC), and lithium salicylate (LS) on cognitive and noncognitive impairments in female transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mice. Female APPswe/PS1dE9 mice at 4 months of age were orally treated with low-dose LISPRO, LS, or LC for 9 months at 2.25 mmol lithium/kg/day followed by determination of body weight, growth of internal organs, and cognitive and noncognitive behavior. No significant differences in body or internal organ weight, anxiety or locomotor activity were found between lithium treated and untreated APPswe/PS1dE9 cohorts. LISPRO, LC, and LS prevented spatial cognitive decline, as determined by Morris water maze and depression as determined by tail suspension test. In addition, LISPRO treatment was superior in preventing associative memory decline determined by contextual fear conditioning and reducing irritability determined by touch escape test in comparison with LC and LS. In conclusion, low-dose LISPRO, LC, and LS treatment prevent spatial cognitive decline and depression-like behavior, while LISPRO prevented hippocampal-dependent associative memory decline and irritability in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Habib A ; Shytle RD ; Sawmiller D ; Koilraj S ; Munna SA ; Rongo D ; Hou H ; Borlongan CV ; Currier G ; Tan J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/jnr.24438 ","Keywords":"Alzheimer Disease/*drug therapy\r\nAnimals\r\nBehavior/*drug effects\r\nBody Weight/drug effects\r\nConditioning, Psychological/drug effects\r\nFear/drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nHindlimb Suspension\r\nLithium Carbonate/*pharmacology\r\nLithium Compounds/*pharmacology\r\nLocomotion/drug effects\r\nMaze Learning/drug effects\r\nMemory/*drug effects\r\nMice\r\nMice, Transgenic\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nProline\r\nSalicylates\r\nSpatial Memory/drug effects\r\nAlzheimer's disease\r\ncognitive impairment\r\ndepression\r\nirritability\r\ntransgenic mice","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Habib A, Shytle RD, Sawmiller D, Koilraj S, Munna SA, Rongo D, Hou H, Borlongan CV, Currier G, and Tan J (2019) Comparing the effect of the novel ionic cocrystal of lithium salicylate proline (LISPRO) with lithium carbonate and lithium salicylate on memory and behavior in female APPswe/PS1dE9 Alzheimer's mice..

This study aimed at investigating the hippocampal expression of the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway in chronic mild stress (CMS)-exposed rats and the effects of Lithium (Li) on the expression of this pathway as a method to identify a plausible link between exposure to chronic stress, microglial activation, and neuroinflammation. METHODS: The effect of chronic administration of Li was investigated on behavioral changes, hippocampal expression of Wnt-DVL-GSK3β-β-catenin signaling pathway, and microglial activation in CMS-exposed male Wistar rats RESULTS: CMS induced a depressive-like behavior associated with increased pro-inflammatory microglial activation and reduced hippocampal expression of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Chronic Li treatment ameliorated stress induced-behavioral changes, reduced microglial activation and enhanced the hippocampal expression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: This work highlights that Li-induced inhibition of GSK-3β with subsequent accumulation of β-catenin could impede pro-inflammatory microglia activation which is a key pathological hallmark associated with depression. Wnt/β-catenin signaling represents a promising therapeutic target, not only for alleviation of depression, but also for a wide array of neurological disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Habib MZ ; Ebeid MA ; El Faramawy Y ; Saad SST ; El Magdoub HM ; Attia AA ; Aboul-Fotouh S ; Abdel-Tawab AM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.taap.2020.115073 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nCytokines/*metabolism\r\nGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/metabolism\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nInflammation Mediators/*metabolism\r\nLithium/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMicroglia/drug effects/metabolism\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nStress, Physiological/*drug effects\r\nWnt Signaling Pathway/*drug effects\r\nbeta Catenin/*metabolism\r\nBeta catenin\r\nChronic mild stress\r\nDepression\r\nLithium\r\nMicroglia\r\nWnt signaling pathway","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Habib MZ, Ebeid MA, El Faramawy Y, Saad SST, El Magdoub HM, Attia AA, Aboul-Fotouh S, and Abdel-Tawab AM (2020) Effects of lithium on cytokine neuro-inflammatory mediators, Wnt/β-catenin signaling and microglial activation in the hippocampus of chronic mild stress-exposed rats..

SOURCES OF DATA: Predominantly meta-analyses and RCTs but supplemented where necessary by additional data and the authors' clinical experience. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: A systematic assessment to identify remedial causes of poor response should be followed by planned sequential treatment trials. Joint decision making by the patient and clinician is essential. Strategies with the strongest support are antidepressant augmentation with lithium or second generation antipsychotics and adding cognitive behavioural treatment. Electroconvulsive therapy is highly effective in resistant depression but there is a high relapse rate when treatment ends. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Some pharmacological strategies have inconsistent data (e.g. antidepressant combinations, T3 augmentation) or limited preliminary data (e.g. ketamine, antidepressant augmentation with pramipexole). The efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is unclear. GROWING POINTS: A greater understanding of the causes of depression may assist the development of more effective treatments. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Role of glutamate antagonists and psychological treatments, other than cognitive behavioural therapy, as adjunctive treatments.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Haddad PM ; Talbot PS ; Anderson IM ; McAllister-Williams RH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/bmb/ldv034 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nComorbidity\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/therapy\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nDrug Substitution\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nMedication Adherence\r\nPsychotherapy/methods\r\nRisk Factors\r\nTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation\r\nECT\r\nantidepressants\r\nantipsychotics\r\ndepression\r\nlithium\r\nneurostimulation therapies\r\ntreatment resistance","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Haddad PM, Talbot PS, Anderson IM, and McAllister-Williams RH (2015) Managing inadequate antidepressant response in depressive illness..

We used data from the Course and Outcome of Bipolar Youth (COBY) study to assess whether lithium vs other mood-stabilizing medication (OMS) was associated with improved outcomes, including mood symptoms and suicidality. METHOD: COBY is a naturalistic, longitudinal study of 413 youths, 7 to 17.11 years old at intake, with BD. At each visit, medication exposure, psychiatric symptoms, and psychosocial function over the preceding follow-up period were assessed using the Adolescent Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation. Using mixed models, we determined whether participants taking lithium vs OMS (but not lithium) differed regarding mood symptoms, suicidality, psychosocial function, hospitalization, aggression, and substance use. RESULTS: A total of 340 participants contributed 2,638 six-month follow-up periods (886 lithium, 1,752 OMS), over a mean follow-up of 10 years. During lithium (vs OMS) follow-up periods, participants were older, less likely to have lifetime anxiety, and less likely to be on antidepressants (p values<.005). After covariate adjustment, the lithium group (vs OMS) had half as many suicide attempts (p = .03), fewer depressive symptoms (p = .004), less psychosocial impairment (p = .003), and less aggression (p = .0004). Similar findings were observed in the subgroup of follow-up periods in which participants were <18 years old. CONCLUSION: Findings are consistent with adult studies, showing that lithium is associated with decreased suicidality, less depression, and better psychosocial functioning. Given the paucity of evidence regarding lithium in children and adolescents, these findings have important clinical implications for the pharmacological management of youths with BD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hafeman DM ; Rooks B ; Merranko J ; Liao F ; Gill MK ; Goldstein TR ; Diler R ; Ryan N ; Goldstein BI ; Axelson DA ; Strober M ; Keller M ; Hunt J ; Hower H ; Weinstock LM ; Yen S ; Birmaher B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jaac.2019.06.013 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAffect\r\nAnxiety Disorders\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nChild\r\nHumans\r\nLithium\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nchild and adolescent\r\nlithium\r\nmood-stabilizing medications\r\nsuicidality","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hafeman DM, Rooks B, Merranko J, Liao F, Gill MK, Goldstein TR, Diler R, Ryan N, Goldstein BI, Axelson DA, Strober M, Keller M, Hunt J, Hower H, Weinstock LM, Yen S, and Birmaher B (2020) Lithium Versus Other Mood-Stabilizing Medications in a Longitudinal Study of Youth Diagnosed With Bipolar Disorder..

While more than half a century has passed since the introduction of lithium into widespread use at the birth of modern psychopharmacology, that medication remains a mainstay for the acute treatment and prevention of recurrent mania/hypomania and depression that characterize bipolar disorder. However, the continued limited understanding of how lithium modulates affective behavior and lack of validated cellular and animal models have resulted in obstacles to discovering more effective mood stabilizers with fewer adverse side effects. In particular, while there has been progress in developing new pharmacotherapy for mania, developing effective treatments for acute bipolar depression remain inadequate. Recent large-scale human genetic studies have confirmed the complex, polygenic nature of the risk architecture of bipolar disorder, and its overlap with other major neuropsychiatric disorders. Such discoveries have begun to shed light on the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. Coupled with broader advances in human neurobiology, neuropharmacology, noninvasive neuromodulation, and clinical trial design, we can envision novel therapeutic strategies informed by defined molecular mechanisms and neural circuits and targeted to the root cause of the pathophysiology. Here, we review recent advances toward the goal of better treatments for bipolar disorder, and we outline major challenges for the field of translational neuroscience that necessitate continued focus on fundamental research and discovery.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Haggarty SJ ; Karmacharya R ; Perlis RH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41380-020-0831-4 ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*genetics\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use\r\nPrecision Medicine/*trends","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Haggarty SJ, Karmacharya R, and Perlis RH (2021) Advances toward precision medicine for bipolar disorder: mechanisms & molecules..

The absence of hippocampal volume changes in most studies of individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) may reflect neuroprotective effects of lithium (Li). METHODS: We recruited 17 BD patients from specialized Li clinics, with at least two years of regularly monitored Li treatment (Li group), and compared them to 12 BD participants with < 3 months of lifetime Li exposure and no Li treatment within two years prior to the scanning (non-Li group) and 11 healthy controls. All BD patients had at least 10 years of illness and five episodes. We also recruited 13 Li-naïve, young BD participants (15-30 years of age) and 18 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. We compared hippocampal volumes obtained from 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using optimized voxel-based morphometry with small volume correction. RESULTS: The non-Li group had smaller left hippocampal volumes than controls (corrected p < 0.05), with a trend for lower volumes than the Li group (corrected p < 0.1), which did not differ from controls. Young, Li-naïve BD patients close to the typical age of onset had comparable hippocampal volumes to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas patients with limited lifetime Li exposure had significantly lower hippocampal volumes than controls, patients with comparable illness burden, but with over two years of Li treatment, or young Li-naïve BD patients, showed hippocampal volumes comparable to controls. These results provide indirect support for neuroprotective effects of Li and negative effects of illness burden on hippocampal volumes in bipolar disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hajek T ; Cullis J ; Novak T ; Kopecek M ; Höschl C ; Blagdon R ; O'Donovan C ; Bauer M ; Young LT ; Macqueen G ; Alda M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1399-5618.2012.01013.x ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnalysis of Variance\r\nAntimanic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/pathology/psychology\r\nCanada\r\n*Cost of Illness\r\nCzech Republic\r\nFemale\r\nHippocampus/*drug effects/*pathology\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Chloride/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hajek T, Cullis J, Novak T, Kopecek M, Höschl C, Blagdon R, O'Donovan C, Bauer M, Young LT, Macqueen G, and Alda M (2012) Hippocampal volumes in bipolar disorders: opposing effects of illness burden and lithium treatment..

Preserved hippocampal volumes in most studies of participants with bipolar disorder may reflect potential neuroprotective effects of lithium (Li). METHODS: To investigate hippocampal volumes in patients with bipolar disorder while controlling for Li exposure, we performed a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies that subdivided patients based on the presence or absence of current Li treatment. To achieve the best coverage of literature, we categorized studies based on whether all or a majority, or whether no or a minority of patients were treated with Li. Hippocampal volumes were compared by combining standardized differences between means (Cohen d) from individual studies using random-effects models. RESULTS: Overall, we analyzed data from 101 patients with bipolar disorder in the Li group, 245 patients in the non-Li group and 456 control participants from 16 studies. Both the left and right hippocampal volumes were significantly larger in the Li group than in controls (Cohen d = 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.18 to 0.88; Cohen d = 0.51, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.81, respectively) or the non-Li group (Cohen d = 0.93, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.31; Cohen d = 1.07, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.45, respectively), which had smaller left and right hippocampal volumes than the control group (Cohen d = -0.36, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.17; Cohen d = -0.38, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.13, respectively). There was no evidence of publication bias. LIMITATIONS: Missing information about the illness burden or lifetime exposure to Li and polypharmacy in some studies may have contributed to statistical heterogeneity in some analyses. CONCLUSION: When exposure to Li was minimized, patients with bipolar disorder showed smaller hippocampal volumes than controls or Li-treated patients. Our findings provide indirect support for the negative effects of bipolar disorder on hippocampal volumes and are consistent with the putative neuroprotective effects of Li. The preserved hippocampal volumes among patients with bipolar disorder in most individual studies and all previous meta-analyses may have been related to the inclusion of Li-treated participants.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hajek T ; Kopecek M ; Höschl C ; Alda M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1503/jpn.110143 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAtrophy/pathology\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/*pathology\r\nCase-Control Studies\r\nHippocampus/*drug effects/*pathology\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNeuroimaging/methods/psychology/*statistics & numerical data\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hajek T, Kopecek M, Höschl C, and Alda M (2012) Smaller hippocampal volumes in patients with bipolar disorder are masked by exposure to lithium: a meta-analysis..

From January through October 2019, 142 female students were randomly selected from the Department of Nutrition and Food Science at the Semnan University of Medical Sciences by simple random sampling. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) were used to assess participants' dietary intake over the past 12 months. Depression, anxiety, and sleep quality were examined by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. In the analysis, the crude model was adjusted for total energy intake (kcal), while the model was adjusted for energy intake (kcal), age, economic status, physical activity level, serum vitamin D level, and body mass index. Dietary zinc intake is significantly associated with depression (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)): 2.34 (0.38-4.30)) and anxiety (OR (95% CI): 3.43 (2.36-4.50)), sleep disorders (OR (95% CI): 3.65 (2.16-5.13)), sleep duration (OR (95% CI): 2.62 (0.39-4.86)), and daytime dysfunction (OR (95% CI): 5.31 (2.84-7.78)) in the model, as well as sleep delay (OR (95% CI): 1.80 (1.05-2.55)) and mental quality of sleep (OR (95% CI): 1.63 (1.10-2.15)) in the crude analysis.

METHODS: According to the research design, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial has been implemented on 60 subjects suffering from CHD and T2DM. Therefore, participants have been randomly divided into 2 groups for taking placebo (n = 30) or 250 mg magnesium oxide plus 150 mg zinc sulfate (n = 30) for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Magnesium and zinc significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (β - 9.44 mg/dL, 95% CI, - 18.30, - 0.57; P = 0.03) and insulin levels (β - 1.37 μIU/mL, 95% CI, - 2.57, - 0.18; P = 0.02). Moreover, HDL-cholesterol levels significantly enhanced (β 2.09 mg/dL, 95% CI, 0.05, 4.13; P = 0.04) in comparison to the placebo. There was an association between magnesium and zinc intake, and a significant decrease of C-reactive protein (CRP) (β - 0.85 mg/L, 95% CI, - 1.26, - 0.45; P < 0.001), a significant increase in total nitrite (β 5.13 μmol/L, 95% CI, 1.85, 8.41; P = 0.003) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (β 43.44 mmol/L, 95% CI, 3.39, 83.50; P = 0.03) when compared with placebo. Furthermore, magnesium and zinc significantly reduced the Beck Depression Inventory index (BDI) (β - 1.66; 95% CI, - 3.32, - 0.009; P = 0.04) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (β - 1.30; 95% CI, - 2.43, - 0.16; P = 0.02) when compared with the placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2DM and CHD, the 12-week intake of magnesium plus zinc had beneficial effects on FPG, HDL-cholesterol, CRP, insulin, total nitrite, TAC levels, and BDI and BAI score. This suggests that magnesium and zinc co-supplementation may be beneficial for patients with T2DM and CHD. Further studies on more patients and lasting longer are needed to determine the safety of magnesium and zinc co-supplementation.

Another option, though with limited evidence, is monotherapy with clozapine. If there is a good reason to avoid combination therapy with an antipsychotic, then a trial of monotherapy with a TCA or an SSRI can be supported.

Their diagnosis and treatment are still in need of improvement. In Germany, a new S3/National Clinical Practice Guideline has been developed for this purpose. METHODS: The existing guidelines on unipolar depression from Germany and other countries were synoptically compared and supplemented with systematic literature searches. After 14 consensus conferences, a total of 107 evidence-based recommendations were issued. RESULTS: Unipolar depression should be diagnosed in accordance with ICD-10 criteria. Screening questionnaires are useful aids to diagnostic classification. When a treatment is chosen, shared decision-making with the patient is essential. Mild depressive episodes can be treated initially by watchful waiting for 14 days. For moderate depressive episodes, pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are equally effective treatment options. For severe depression, a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy is recommended. If 4 to 6 weeks of acute therapy are insufficiently effective, lithium augmentation is recommended, rather than combination antidepressant therapy or a switch to another antidepressant. After remission, maintenance therapy should be continued for 4 to 9 months. In recurrent depression, pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy, where appropriate, should be continued for at least two years. Specific recommendations are given for patients who have somatic or mental comorbidities or are acutely suicidal, and recommendations are also given for coordination of care. CONCLUSION: This guideline is a comprehensive set of evidence- and consensus-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of unipolar depression. An improvement in the care of patients with unipolar depression will require broad implementation of the guideline, both in the inpatient and outpatient setting.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Härter M ; Klesse C ; Bermejo I ; Schneider F ; Berger M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3238/arztebl.2010.0700 ","Keywords":"Depressive Disorder/*diagnosis/*therapy\r\nGermany\r\nHumans\r\nInternationality\r\nNeurology/*standards\r\n*Practice Guidelines as Topic\r\nPsychotherapy/*standards","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Härter M, Klesse C, Bermejo I, Schneider F, and Berger M (2010) Unipolar depression: diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations from the current S3/National Clinical Practice Guideline..

Suicide is one of the most serious complications of major depression. METHODS: An online search of the medical literature was used to select English-language articles addressing depression using, but not limited to, the following specific terms: \"primary care,\" \"depressive disorders,\" \"bipolar disorder,\" \"suicide,\" \"psychosis,\" and \"antidepressants.\" RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of the manic phases of bipolar disorder includes lithium or anticonvulsants. Breakthrough depression can be particularly resistant to treatment in bipolar patients, and the tricyclic antidepressants can cause patients to cycle more rapidly into the manic phase. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and bupropion are less likely to cause rapid cycling in bipolar disorder. Depressed patients with suicidal tendencies should be closely monitored and given full doses of antidepressant medications. The SSRIs lessen suicidal tendencies and, importantly, are markedly safer than the tricyclic antidepressants when taken in an overdose. Depressed patients can also become psychotic, exhibiting mood-congruent delusions. Combination therapy with antidepressant and antipsychotic medications is often necessary. Some physicians prefer to hospitalize patients with psychotic depression. Depression can be a complex and multifaceted disorder that requires careful diagnosis and treatment plans.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hartmann PM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*complications/diagnosis/*therapy\r\nCase Management\r\nDepressive Disorder/*complications/*therapy\r\nHumans\r\nPrimary Health Care/*methods\r\nPsychotic Disorders/complications/therapy\r\n*Suicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hartmann PM (1996) Strategies for managing depression complicated by bipolar disorder, suicidal ideation, or psychotic features..

Mood stabilizers have acute and long-term effects and at a minimum are prophylactic for manic or depressive poles without detriment to the other. Lithium has significant effects on mania and depression, but may be augmented or substituted by some antiepileptic drugs. The biochemical basis for mood stabilizer therapies or the molecular origins of bipolar disorder is unknown. One approach to this problem is to seek a common target of all mood stabilizers. Lithium directly inhibits two evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathways. It both suppresses inositol signaling through depletion of intracellular inositol and inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), a multifunctional protein kinase. A number of GSK-3 substrates are involved in neuronal function and organization, and therefore present plausible targets for therapy. Valproic acid (VPA) is an antiepileptic drug with mood-stabilizing properties. It may indirectly reduce GSK-3 activity, and can up-regulate gene expression through inhibition of histone deacetylase. These effects, however, are not conserved between different cell types. VPA also inhibits inositol signaling through an inositol-depletion mechanism. There is no evidence for GSK-3 inhibition by carbamazepine, a second antiepileptic mood stabilizer. In contrast, this drug alters neuronal morphology through an inositol-depletion mechanism as seen with lithium and VPA. Studies on the enzyme prolyl oligopeptidase and the sodium myo-inositol transporter support an inositol-depletion mechanism for mood stabilizer action. Despite these intriguing observations, it remains unclear how changes in inositol signaling underlie the origins of bipolar disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Harwood AJ ; Agam G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0006-2952(03)00187-4 ","Keywords":"Affect/drug effects\r\nAnimals\r\nAnticonvulsants/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nCarbamazepine/therapeutic use\r\nGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3/physiology\r\nHumans\r\nInositol/physiology\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nMood Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nSignal Transduction/drug effects\r\nValproic Acid/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Harwood AJ, and Agam G (2003) Search for a common mechanism of mood stabilizers..

Especially with disorders presenting with an admixture or frequent change of psychotic and affective symptoms, diagnostic specifity of the DSM and ICD diminishes. In those instances, alternative concepts as cycloid psychosis might display more accurately the very characteristics and course of a mental disorder and help to tailor individualized treatments. Karl Leonhard described three major subtypes of cycloid psychosis: anxiety-happiness psychosis, confusion psychosis, and motility psychosis, all showing a pleiomorphic symptom profile resembling intraphasic switching of poles. Here we present the case of a 59-year-old woman suffering from cycloid psychosis as defined by the criteria of Perris. Between 2013 and June 2019, the patient was admitted 35 times for compulsory treatment. A frequent change of diagnoses, ranging from adjustment disorder to complex PTSD, and from unipolar depression to \"pseudoneurotic schizophrenia,\" resembles the puzzling manifestations. Most of the time the patient was labeled as schizoaffective disorder despite never displaying clear psychotic core symptoms. Despite treatment with different antipsychotics including LAI the cumulative length of hospitalization increased steadily from 74 days in 2014 to 292 days in 2017. When reviewing the case in 2017 the longitudinal pattern of her disorder and the diverse acute manifestations were finally conceptualized as a cyclic on-off of an atypical psychosis. After starting lithium to pre-existing LAI antipsychotics and valproic acid, the number of days per year spent in inpatient care sharply dropped to 136 in 2018. We propose to reconsider cycloid psychosis as a useful clinical concept whose descriptive value, validity and utility for treatment decisions should be further evaluated.

(p-ClPhSe)(2) is an organoselenium compound reported to have antioxidant, antidepressant-like, and neuroprotective actions. This study investigated whether antioxidant activity and modulation of the glutamatergic system contribute to the antidepressant-like effect of (p-ClPhSe)(2) in mice subchronically exposed to DEX. Swiss mice received intraperitoneal injections of DEX (2 mg/kg) or saline (vehicle) once a day for 21 days. After, the mice received (p-ClPhSe)(2) (1-10 mg/kg) or mineral oil (vehicle) by the intragastric route (i.g.) for 7 days. The mice exposed to DEX were treated with fluoxetine (20 mg/kg, i.g.) once a day for 7 days. 24 h after the last treatment, the animals performed the locomotor activity (LMA), tail suspension, and forced swimming tests. Ex vivo assays were performed in samples of prefrontal cortex (PFC). The results show that (p-ClPhSe)(2) reversed depressive-like behavioral phenotype induced by DEX without affecting LMA. Further, (p-ClPhSe)(2) at all doses reduced ROS levels and increased CAT activity in the PFC of DEX-exposed mice. The highest dose of (p-ClPhSe)(2) was effective against the decrease of SOD activity in the PFC of mice exposed to DEX. (p-ClPhSe)(2) increased the [(3)H] glutamate uptake/release and decreased the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity as well as the EAAT1 and NMDA R2A protein contents in the PFC of DEX-exposed mice. Regarding the NMDA R2B levels, there was no difference among experimental groups. In conclusion, this study reveals the effectiveness of (p-ClPhSe)(2) in reversing the depressive-like phenotype of DEX-exposed mice. In addition, (p-ClPhSe)(2) modulated oxidative stress and glutamate neurotransmission in the PFC of mice subchronically exposed to DEX.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Heck SO ; Zborowski VA ; Quines CB ; Nogueira CW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2019.05.027 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nAntioxidants/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nDepression/chemically induced/*drug therapy\r\nDexamethasone/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFluoxetine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nGlucocorticoids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nGlutamic Acid/*metabolism\r\nLocomotion/*drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nOrganoselenium Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nPhenotype\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/*drug effects\r\nSynaptic Transmission/*drug effects\r\nDepression\r\nDexamethasone\r\nFluoxetine\r\nGlucocorticoids\r\nSelenium","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Heck SO, Zborowski VA, Quines CB, and Nogueira CW (2019) 4,4'-Dichlorodiphenyl diselenide reverses a depressive-like phenotype, modulates prefrontal cortical oxidative stress and dysregulated glutamatergic neurotransmission induced by subchronic dexamethasone exposure to mice..

METHOD: This open prospective study was conducted in the inpatient depression unit of a university hospital in The Netherlands. Patients were enrolled in the study from October 1996 to June 2002 and had to meet DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder. Eighty-six patients were treated twice weekly with ECT until recovery or no progress during at least 10 bilateral treatments. Patients were maintained drug free during the ECT treatment. Clinical evaluation of depressive symptoms was performed each week; scores on the 17-item version of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) were obtained 1 to 3 days prior to ECT and 1 to 3 days after treatment termination. The primary outcome criterion was defined as the mean difference in HAM-D score before and after ECT for patients who had received adequate treatment with a TCA and lithium compared with patients who had not received adequate treatment with a TCA and lithium. Adequate treatment was defined as 4 weeks taking a predefined plasma level of a TCA; nonresponders had lithium added to the medication, and the minimal duration of the lithium addition was 3 weeks with a plasma level of at least 0.6 mmol/L. Independent samples t test was used to analyze this primary outcome criterion. RESULTS: According to the primary outcome criterion, patients who had received adequate treatment with a TCA and lithium (N = 56) had a mean difference in HAM-D score pre-ECT and post-ECT of 16.4 compared to a HAM-D score difference of 19.5 in the patient group who had received inadequate treatment with a TCA and lithium (N = 30). This inequality in differences in mean HAM-D scores is not significant (p = .2). CONCLUSION: In the present study sample, treatment failure with adequate pharmacotherapy with a TCA and lithium addition appears to be unrelated to outcome following subsequent ECT.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Heijnen WT ; van den Broek WW ; Birkenhäger TK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/jcp.v69n1206 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic \r\n      use\r\nAntimanic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\n*Electroconvulsive Therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHospitalization\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPersonality Inventory\r\nPrognosis\r\nProspective Studies\r\nRetreatment\r\nTreatment Failure\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Heijnen WT, van den Broek WW, and Birkenhäger TK (2008) Treatment failure with a tricyclic antidepressant followed by lithium addition and response to subsequent electroconvulsive therapy..

Although there is little doubt that lithium is effective in a sizable percentage of patients who do not respond to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), much remains obscure about this effect. Does it work preferentially on antidepressants that act primarily on serotonergic neurons, or is it equally effective with agents that act upon other neurotransmitter systems? When should lithium, compared with other strategies, be utilized in antidepressant nonresponders? Are certain subtypes of depression more likely than others to respond to lithium augmentation?

After at least 21 days of antidepressant drug therapy, and while continuing to receive the same daily dose of antidepressant drug, eight patients received lithium carbonate and seven received placebo. In comparison with placebo, lithium carbonate produced a small but statistically significant improvement in the mean daily nursing ratings of depression during the first two days of treatment. The beneficial effects of lithium carbonate were more variable during the next four days, but by the seventh through 12th day of the trial, the drug produced a significant and clinically meaningful improvement. When the seven placebo-treated patients received active lithium carbonate on the 13th day of the study, their rate of improvement was similar to that of the eight patients who had received active lithium carbonate initially. This augmentation of the anti-depressant effect was seen in patients treated with desipramine hydrochloride, amitriptyline hydrochloride, or mianserin hydrochloride. Although in five of the 15 patients, the improvement appeared as early as 24 to 48 hours after the first lithium carbonate dose, the remaining patients did not show a clear improvement until approximately five to eight days later. We concluded that lithium carbonate does augment the antidepressant effect when added to the long-term antidepressant treatment of nonresponding patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Heninger GR ; Charney DS ; Sternberg DE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1001/archpsyc.1983.01790110077013 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAmitriptyline/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDesipramine/therapeutic use\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nLithium Carbonate\r\nMale\r\nMianserin/therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Heninger GR, Charney DS, and Sternberg DE (1983) Lithium carbonate augmentation of antidepressant treatment.

Major treatment guidelines recommend lithium as a first-line treatment for mania and maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder, yet lithium has fallen out of favor while other agents have grown in popularity. The purpose of this review is to examine the evidence for treatments that were available in 1970 and to determine if the field has made any significant advance in the treatment of mania, bipolar depression, and maintenance. METHODS: We conducted a MEDLINE search through 2009, and examined only English-language, randomized/controlled, placebo, or comparison studies. Tolerability as a factor was not considered for this review. RESULTS: Lithium, valproate, benzodiazepines, and antipsychotics have been reported effective for mania-which was essentially the state of the field in 1970. Despite an FDA indication for the use of lamotrigine for depression and depression maintenance, the supporting evidence is conflicting. For bipolar maintenance, the evidence is overwhelming in support of lithium and very thin for valproate and carbamazepine. There is emerging evidence that several atypical antipsychotics may have efficacy in prevention. DISCUSSION: The gold standard for treating bipolar disorder in 1970 was lithium, and the gold standard in 2009 remains lithium. Newer agents may increase our armamentarium to some extent, but it is not clear if they represent a major advance in treatment. They still need to be tested against the gold standard.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hirschowitz J ; Kolevzon A ; Garakani A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3109/10673229.2010.507042 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hirschowitz J, Kolevzon A, and Garakani A (2010) The pharmacological treatment of bipolar disorder: the question of modern advances..

In 2005, AACAP published algorithms to guide pharmacological treatment of manic/mixed episodes associated with PBD. At that time, lithium was the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for pediatric bipolar manic/mixed episodes. The goal of this article is to review evidence that has emerged since the AACAP algorithm in 2005. Methods: Literature searches were conducted through PubMed and limited to studies published between 2005 and 2021, using keywords that focused on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for available psychopharmacological medications. In addition, the authors conducted in-depth searches for articles providing evidence for agents included in the 2005 AACAP algorithm. Results: Since the publication of the AACAP algorithm in 2005, multiple RCTs have been conducted in PBD, leading to FDA approval of five medications (aripiprazole, asenapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone) for the treatment of manic/mixed episodes and two medications (lurasidone and olanzapine-fluoxetine combination) for the treatment of depressed episodes. Divalproex sodium and oxcarbazepine were studied in pediatric RCTs and failed to separate from placebo. Conclusions: We offer an update to the 2005 AACAP algorithms for the treatment of pediatric bipolar mixed/manic episodes and added an evidence-based algorithm for the treatment of depression in PBD. In addition to treatment algorithms, we review current evidence for efficacy of agents proposed in the AACAP algorithm and provide tables summarizing medication side effects and efficacy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hobbs E ; Reed R ; Lorberg B ; Robb AS ; Dorfman J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1089/cap.2022.0035 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nChild\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis\r\n*Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nMania/drug therapy\r\nOlanzapine/therapeutic use\r\nAlgorithms\r\nbipolar depression\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nmania\r\nmood disorders\r\npediatrics\r\npsychopharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hobbs E, Reed R, Lorberg B, Robb AS, and Dorfman J (2022) Psychopharmacological Treatment Algorithms of Manic/Mixed and Depressed Episodes in Pediatric Bipolar Disorder..

For weeks 2 through 4, the dose of venlafaxine was increased to 75 mg twice daily, and for weeks 5 through 7, the dose was further increased to 75 mg three times daily. At the end of the 7-week treatment period, patients with a <50% decrease in their HAM-D scores from baseline were given lithium carbonate 600 mg once daily. The dose of lithium carbonate was adjusted to maintain plasma levels in the range of 0.6 to 1.0 mmol/mL. Efficacy was assessed with the 17-item HAM-D, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Clinical Global Impressions Scale. Data were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. At the end of the 7-week treatment period, 35% of patients showed a > or = 50% decrease in their HAM-D scores from baseline. Lithium augmentation was initiated in 23 patients. The results showed that the addition of lithium was well-tolerated and led to a further decrease in the HAM-D scores, with eight patients responding and two of them presenting a remission. The addition of lithium to venlafaxine was found to be a well-tolerated strategy in treatment-resistant patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hoencamp E ; Haffmans J ; Dijken WA ; Huijbrechts IP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00004714-200010000-00008 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/adverse \r\n      effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nCyclohexanols/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nVenlafaxine Hydrochloride","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hoencamp E, Haffmans J, Dijken WA, and Huijbrechts IP (2000) Lithium augmentation of venlafaxine: an open-label trial..

Clinical trials and relevant articles were identified by cross-referencing major depressive disorder (and/or variants) with the following terms: folate, homocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), L-acetylcarnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, N-acetylcysteine, L-tryptophan, zinc, magnesium, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, and inositol. Manual reviews of references were also performed using article reference lists. Abnormal levels of folate, homocysteine, and SAMe have been shown to be associated with a higher risk of depression. Numerous studies have demonstrated antidepressant activity with L-methylfolate and SAMe supplementation in individuals with depression. Additionally, the amino acids L-acetylcarnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, N-acetylcysteine, and L-tryptophan have been implicated in the development of depression and shown to exert antidepressant effects. Other agents with evidence for improving depressive symptoms include zinc, magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids, and coenzyme Q10. Potential biases and differences in study designs within and amongst the studies and reviews selected may confound results. Augmentation of antidepressant medications with various supplements targeting nutritional and physiological factors can potentiate antidepressant effects. Medical foods, particularly L-methylfolate, and other supplements may play a role in managing depression in patients with inadequate response to antidepressant therapies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hoepner CT ; McIntyre RS ; Papakostas GI ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu13030767 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMood Disorders/*therapy\r\nNutrition Therapy/*methods\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTrace Elements/*therapeutic use\r\nVitamins/*therapeutic use\r\nL-acetylcarnitine\r\nadjunctive therapy\r\nantidepressants\r\ndepression\r\ninflammation\r\nnutritional deficiencies","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hoepner CT, McIntyre RS, and Papakostas GI (2021) Impact of Supplementation and Nutritional Interventions on Pathogenic Processes of Mood Disorders: A Review of the Evidence..

Because extrapyramidal side effects of typical neuroleptic medications often resemble such features, we first systematically studied the contribution of extrapyramidal side effects to these problems and their treatment. For patients who remained distressed, controlled trials of supplemental thymoleptics were undertaken. METHODS: In trial 1, 92 distressed (depressed and/or anxious) patients and 36 patients in a defect state (patients with negative symptoms) participated in a double-blind, intramuscular challenge that compared centrally acting benztropine mesylate with peripherally acting glycopyrrolate. In trial 2, 57 distressed patients and 22 patients in a defect state were randomly assigned to a double-blind, neuroleptic medication dose-reduction group. In trial 3, 57 chronically distressed patients who were maintained on a low dose of fluphenazine decanoate were randomly assigned to a supplemental desipramine hydrochloride, lithium carbonate, or placebo group under double-blind conditions for 12 weeks. RESULTS: For patients who were already maintained on antiparkinsonian medication, impaired affect was not resolved by additional benztropine. Only distressed patients with a family history of severe mental disorder (often affective) showed improvement with neuroleptic medication dose reduction. Patients in the defect-state group reported less dysphoria on a reduced neuroleptic medication dose, but negative symptoms persisted. Desipramine improved diverse aspects of mood and residual psychoticism, possibly as a prophylaxis against minor affective exacerbations. Depression improved in women only. Lithium positively affected multiple indexes of anxiety and anxious depression. CONCLUSION: Most often, persistent affective impairments are neither resistant extrapyramidal side effects nor characterological traits. Thymoleptics improve the nonphasic, chronic types of anxiety and depression in contrast to the acute, episodic forms, for which little support can be found in the literature.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hogarty GE ; McEvoy JP ; Ulrich RF ; DiBarry AL ; Bartone P ; Cooley S ; Hammill K ; Carter M ; Munetz MR ; Perel J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1001/archpsyc.1995.03950130029004 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAmbulatory Care\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/adverse effects\r\nAnxiety Disorders/chemically induced/diagnosis/*drug therapy\r\nBasal Ganglia Diseases/diagnosis/etiology/prevention & control\r\nBenztropine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/chemically induced/diagnosis/*drug therapy\r\nDesipramine/therapeutic use\r\nDiagnosis, Differential\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nFluphenazine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use\r\nGlycopyrrolate/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPlacebos\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSchizophrenia/*drug therapy\r\n*Schizophrenic Psychology\r\nSex Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hogarty GE, McEvoy JP, Ulrich RF, DiBarry AL, Bartone P, Cooley S, Hammill K, Carter M, Munetz MR, and Perel J (1995) Pharmacotherapy of impaired affect in recovering schizophrenic patients..

BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) is defined as a major depressive episode that begins within 1 month of delivery and is experienced by roughly 13% of mothers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four Hundred participants were recruited through the internet. Data gathered via multiple choice questionnaires was statistically analyzed using SPSS and Statistical software; statistical procedures included discriminant analysis, Pearson's product moment correlation, independent t-test and cross-tabulations. RESULTS: Out of 400 participants 83 (20.8%) were affected by self-reported depression after a pregnancy between 2003 and 2008. Depressed subjects consumed oily fish and offal significantly more often than non depressed subjects. Depression was more prevalent among women with vegetarian diets. No significant difference concerning food group intake or the ratios between foods rich in nutrients beneficial to NS health and foods rich in compounds antagonising their effect were found between depressed and non depressed subjects. Iron supplementation correlated positively with zinc supplementation in both groups. Roughly 70% of women reported to have received no information about n-3 fatty acid fish oils during pregnancy; informed subjects consumed fish oils more often. The majority of subjects with self-reported depression described nutritional support during pregnancy as inadequate. CONCLUSION: Within this Austrian sample, the prevalence rate of postpartum depression was high; while the consumption of oily fish and vegetarian diets negatively correlated with depression, Patient information positively correlated with the consumption of fish oil supplements. These results indicate that further studies will be required in order to establish the exact relationship between nutrition and mental health during and after pregnancy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hogg-Kollars S ; Mortimore D ; Snow S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Consumer health information\r\nDepression postpartum\r\nDiet\r\nMaternal nutrition physiology\r\nMental health","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hogg-Kollars S, Mortimore D, and Snow S (2011) Nutrition health issues in self-reported postpartum depression..

This disorder is separated into two major types, bipolar I disorder, with mania and typically recurrent depression, and bipolar II disorder, with recurrent major depression and hypomania. Patients with bipolar disorder spend the majority of time experiencing depression, and this typically is the presenting symptom. Because outcomes are improved with earlier diagnosis and treatment, physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for bipolar disorder. The most effective long-term treatments are lithium and valproic acid, although other drugs also are used. In addition to referral to a mental health subspecialist for initiation and management of drug treatment, patients with bipolar disorder should be provided with resources for psychotherapy. Several comorbidities commonly associated with bipolar disorder include other mental disorders, substance use disorders, migraine headaches, chronic pain, stroke, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Family physicians who care for patients with bipolar disorder should focus their efforts on prevention and management of comorbidities. These patients should be assessed continually for risk of suicide because they are at high risk and their suicide attempts tend to be successful.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Holder SD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/psychology\r\nCardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/therapy\r\nChronic Pain/epidemiology/therapy\r\nComorbidity\r\n*Family Practice\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nMetabolic Syndrome/epidemiology/therapy\r\nMigraine Disorders/epidemiology/therapy\r\n*Preventive Medicine\r\n*Psychiatry\r\nReferral and Consultation\r\nStroke/epidemiology/therapy\r\nSubstance-Related Disorders/epidemiology/therapy\r\nValproic Acid/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Holder SD (2017) Psychotic and Bipolar Disorders: Bipolar Disorder..

Most people who become depressed will have multiple episodes, and some depressions are chronic. Persons with bipolar disorder will also have manic or hypomanic episodes. Given the recurrent nature of the disorder, it is important not just to treat the acute episode, but also to protect against its return and the onset of subsequent episodes. Several types of interventions have been shown to be efficacious in treating depression. The antidepressant medications are relatively safe and work for many patients, but there is no evidence that they reduce risk of recurrence once their use is terminated. The different medication classes are roughly comparable in efficacy, although some are easier to tolerate than are others. About half of all patients will respond to a given medication, and many of those who do not will respond to some other agent or to a combination of medications. Electro-convulsive therapy is particularly effective for the most severe and resistant depressions, but raises concerns about possible deleterious effects on memory and cognition. It is rarely used until a number of different medications have been tried. Although it is still unclear whether traditional psychodynamic approaches are effective in treating depression, interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) has fared well in controlled comparisons with medications and other types of psychotherapies. It also appears to have a delayed effect that improves the quality of social relationships and interpersonal skills. It has been shown to reduce acute distress and to prevent relapse and recurrence so long as it is continued or maintained. Treatment combining IPT with medication retains the quick results of pharmacotherapy and the greater interpersonal breadth of IPT, as well as boosting response in patients who are otherwise more difficult to treat. The main problem is that IPT has only recently entered clinical practice and is not widely available to those in need. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) also appears to be efficacious in treating depression, and recent studies suggest that it can work for even severe depressions in the hands of experienced therapists. Not only can CBT relieve acute distress, but it also appears to reduce risk for the return of symptoms as long as it is continued or maintained. Moreover, it appears to have an enduring effect that reduces risk for relapse or recurrence long after treatment is over. Combined treatment with medication and CBT appears to be as efficacious as treatment with medication alone and to retain the enduring effects of CBT. There also are indications that the same strategies used to reduce risk in psychiatric patients following successful treatment can be used to prevent the initial onset of depression in persons at risk. More purely behavioral interventions have been studied less than the cognitive therapies, but have performed well in recent trials and exhibit many of the benefits of cognitive therapy. Mood stabilizers like lithium or the anticonvulsants form the core treatment for bipolar disorder, but there is a growing recognition that the outcomes produced by modern pharmacology are not sufficient. Both IPT and CBT show promise as adjuncts to medication with such patients. The same is true for family-focused therapy, which is designed to reduce interpersonal conflict in the family. Clearly, more needs to be done with respect to treatment of the bipolar disorders. Good medical management of depression can be hard to find, and the empirically supported psychotherapies are still not widely practiced. As a consequence, many patients do not have access to adequate treatment. Moreover, not everyone responds to the existing interventions, and not enough is known about what to do for people who are not helped by treatment. Although great strides have been made over the past few decades, much remains to be done with respect to the treatment of depression and the bipolar disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hollon SD ; Thase ME ; Markowitz JC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/1529-1006.00008 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hollon SD, Thase ME, and Markowitz JC (2002) Treatment and Prevention of Depression..

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single-centre, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Participants received intravenous iron (n = 97) or oral iron (n = 99), and completed the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and haematological and iron parameters were measured. Primary outcome was the aggregated change in physical fatigue score from baseline to 12 weeks postpartum. RESULTS: The difference in physical fatigue score was -0·97 (95% CI: -1·65; -0·28, P = 0·006) in favour of intravenous iron, but did not meet the predefined difference of 1·8. Across visits, we found statistically significant differences in fatigue and depression scores, as well as in haematological and iron parameters, all in favour of intravenous iron. There were no serious adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: A single dose of intravenous iron was associated with a statistically significant reduction in aggregated physical fatigue within 12 weeks after postpartum haemorrhage compared to standard medical care with oral iron below the prespecified criteria of clinical superiority. As patient-reported outcomes improved significantly and intravenous iron resulted in a fast hematopoietic response without serious adverse reactions, intravenous iron may be a useful alternative after postpartum haemorrhage if oral iron is not absorbed or tolerated.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Holm C ; Thomsen LL ; Norgaard A ; Langhoff-Roos J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/vox.12477 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAdult\r\nAnemia, Iron-Deficiency/*drug therapy\r\nArea Under Curve\r\nFatigue/etiology/*prevention & control\r\nFemale\r\nHemoglobins/analysis\r\nHumans\r\nInfusions, Intravenous\r\nIron/*administration & dosage\r\nPostpartum Hemorrhage/*pathology\r\nPostpartum Period\r\nPregnancy\r\nROC Curve\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nanaemia\r\nintravenous iron\r\niron deficiency\r\niron isomaltoside\r\npostpartum fatigue\r\npostpartum haemorrhage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Holm C, Thomsen LL, Norgaard A, and Langhoff-Roos J (2017) Single-dose intravenous iron infusion or oral iron for treatment of fatigue after postpartum haemorrhage: a randomized controlled trial..

Red blood cell transfusion is also widely used to treat severe postpartum anaemia, though accumulating evidence questions its risk-benefit ratio. Intravenous iron has in previous studies been associated with fast improvement of haemoglobin and iron biochemical markers in the treatment of postpartum anaemia, but there is a lack of studies on patient reported outcomes. The thesis is based on three studies of intravenous iron (Monofer, iron isomaltoside) as an alternative to current treatment practice in postpartum iron deficiency and anaemia. The first study is a randomised controlled trial comparing a high single-dose iron infusion with oral iron in women after postpartum haemorrhage without severe anaemia. The primary outcome was the aggregated change in physical fatigue within 12 weeks postpartum. We found a difference that was statistically significant, but less than the consensus-based and predefined minimal clinically relevant level. Across visits, particularly in the first weeks postpartum, we found statistically significant differences in fatigue and depression scores, all in favour of intravenous iron. We confirmed previous findings of a fast haematopoietic response and prompt replenishment of iron stores that persisted throughout the 12 weeks of follow-up. The second study, a randomised controlled pilot study, tested feasibility and exploratory outcomes of a high single-dose iron infusion compared with red blood cell transfusion for the treatment of severe postpartum anaemia. We found that randomisation could be feasible with some adjustments for a future study design. The difference in biochemical markers was larger than the patient-reported outcomes in the first week. A larger trial is needed to determine whether a high single-dose iron infusion is non-inferior to red blood cell transfusion in severe postpartum anaemia. The third study compared iron concentration in breast milk in a randomised sample of women receiving high single-dose iron infusion or oral iron. A high single-dose iron infusion lead to a transient increase in the iron concentration in breast milk, which remained within the normal range. In conclusion, iron isomaltoside seems to be associated with improved patient-reported outcomes compared to oral iron treatment, and in severe postpartum anaemia intravenous iron seems promising as an alternative to red blood cell transfusion.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Holm C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/blood/*drug therapy\r\nBiomarkers/blood\r\nDenmark\r\nDepression/complications\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nErythrocyte Transfusion\r\nFatigue/complications\r\nFeasibility Studies\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfusions, Intravenous\r\nIron/*administration & dosage/blood\r\nPatient Reported Outcome Measures\r\nPilot Projects\r\nPostpartum Hemorrhage/therapy\r\nPostpartum Period\r\nPregnancy\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSeverity of Illness Index","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Holm C (2018) Intravenous iron treatment in the puerperium..

Materials and methods: This is a subanalysis of a single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial conducted in women suffering from postpartum hemorrhage. Participants were randomized 1:1 to 1200 mg iron isomaltoside or current treatment practice with oral iron. We measured fatigue by the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and determined hematological parameters. The subanalysis includes all participants with a high fatigue score (MFI physical fatigue score >15) at inclusion. The primary endpoint was aggregated change in physical fatigue score from inclusion to 12 weeks postpartum with a predefined minimum clinically relevant difference of 1.8. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT01895218). Results: A total of 85 women had a high fatigue score at inclusion. The aggregated change in physical fatigue score was -2.3 (confidence interval 95%: -3.3; -1.3) (p < .0001) in favor of iron isomaltoside. Significant differences in other fatigue and depression scores and hematological parameters were observed and all in favor of iron isomaltoside. There were no differences in side effects between the groups. Conclusions: In women suffering from severe fatigue after postpartum hemorrhage, a single dose of iron isomaltoside is associated with a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in aggregated physical fatigue within 12 weeks after delivery, when compared to current treatment practice with oral iron and with a similar safety profile.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Holm C ; Thomsen LL ; Langhoff-Roos J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/14767058.2018.1449205 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDepression, Postpartum/diagnosis/drug therapy\r\nDisaccharides/*administration & dosage\r\nFatigue/blood/*drug therapy/etiology/psychology\r\nFemale\r\nFerric Compounds/*administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nInfusions, Intravenous\r\n*Postpartum Hemorrhage\r\nPregnancy\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nAnemia\r\nintravenous iron\r\niron deficiency\r\npostpartum depression\r\npostpartum hemorrhage\r\nferric derisomaltose","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Holm C, Thomsen LL, and Langhoff-Roos J (2019) Intravenous iron isomaltoside treatment of women suffering from severe fatigue after postpartum hemorrhage..

Lithium is the treatment of choice for both acute affective episodes and long-term maintenance, but not all patients respond adequately to lithium therapy. Alternatives or adjuncts to lithium in acute mania include carbamazepine, valproate, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and clozapine. For acute depression, antidepressants often are added to lithium treatment or used alone; nonpharmacologic options include ECT and light therapy. Studies suggest that carbamazepine and valproate may be as effective as lithium in maintenance therapy and that thyroid supplementation may increase response in rapid-cycling patients. Using psychosocial intervention in addition to maintenance pharmacologic treatment may increase medication compliance, decrease hospitalizations, and increase overall functioning.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hopkins HS ; Gelenberg AJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology/therapy\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hopkins HS, and Gelenberg AJ (1994) Treatment of bipolar disorder: how far have we come?.

METHOD: We used data from a study (conducted from September 1997 to October 2000) in which DSM-IV bipolar I manic or mixed-episode patients who were partially responsive to at least 2 weeks of lithium or dival-proex monotherapy prior to study entry were randomly assigned to augmentation therapy with olanzapine (5-20 mg/day) or placebo. Among mixed-episode patients with residual suicidality (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-item 3 [HAM-D-3] score of 1 or above) at randomization to cotherapy, we identified items in the Young Mania Rating Scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale that correlated with HAM-D-3 scores. We used factor analysis of correlated items to identify symptom domains associated with suicidality ratings and assessed changes in symptom factors and HAM-D-3 scores during 6 weeks of combination therapy with olanzapine versus placebo. RESULTS: In 58 mixed-episode patients, mean +/- SD HAM-D-3 scores averaged 1.36 +/- 0.55 after at least 2 weeks of initial mood stabilizer monotherapy prior to study entry. Factors associated with the HAM-D-3 appeared to represent somatic discomfort, agitated depression, and psychotic features. Combination therapy with olanzapine (N = 36) versus placebo (N = 22) differentially reduced HAM-D-3 scores by 58% versus 29% (p < .05) within 1 week, and all 3 associated symptom factors within 2 weeks by averages of 31% versus 12% (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Suicidality in adult, mixed-episode, bipolar I disorder patients was associated with somatic discomfort, agitated depression, and psychosis. Overall, these findings suggest that the addition of an atypical antipsychotic-antimanic agent in some bipolar disorder patients may help to reduce suicidal ideation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Houston JP ; Ahl J ; Meyers AL ; Kaiser CJ ; Tohen M ; Baldessarini RJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/jcp.v67n0811 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnticonvulsants/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBenzodiazepines/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOlanzapine\r\nPlacebos\r\nPrincipal Component Analysis\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales/statistics & numerical data\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSuicide/*psychology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nValproic Acid/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Houston JP, Ahl J, Meyers AL, Kaiser CJ, Tohen M, and Baldessarini RJ (2006) Reduced suicidal ideation in bipolar I disorder mixed-episode patients in a placebo-controlled trial of olanzapine combined with lithium or divalproex..

Previous studies have found that zinc levels were decreased in serum and brain of depressed patients or animal models. Zinc treatment can improve depressive symptoms and enhance the antidepressant effects of monoamine antidepressants. However, its mechanism of action is still unclear. This present study aims to investigate whether the zinc can enhance the rapid action of traditional antidepressant imipramine and to explore the potential mechanisms of action through the rapid antidepressant targets CREB (cAMP-response element binding protein) and mTOR (mammalian target of the rapamycin). Drug treatment included intraperitoneal injection of imipramine or zinc alone and imipramine plus zinc. Zinc had a rapid enhanced antidepressive effect on the imipramine and achieved a rapid antidepressant effect similar to ketamine. Combination of zinc with imipramine rapidly enhanced the phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2448 and CREB Ser133, and increased the expression of mTOR and CREB, which were dependent on the activation of PKA. In conclusion, combination therapy with zinc and monoamine antidepressants may overcome the problem of slow-onset action of traditional antidepressants in clinical uses.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Huang Y ; Xu D ; Xiang H ; Yan S ; Sun F ; Wei Z ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.08.059 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nCyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism\r\nCyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nHelplessness, Learned\r\nImipramine/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSignal Transduction/*drug effects\r\nTOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism\r\nZinc/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression\r\nImipramine\r\nMammalian target of rapamycin\r\nProtein kinase A\r\nZinc\r\ncAMP-response element binding protein","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Huang Y, Xu D, Xiang H, Yan S, Sun F, and Wei Z (2019) Rapid antidepressant actions of imipramine potentiated by zinc through PKA-dependented regulation of mTOR and CREB signaling..

Both conditions are associated with poorer patient outcomes including mortality, hospitalisation and quality of life. Iron replacement has come to the fore as a means to improve patient outcomes. This review aims to assess the current literature regarding the benefits of iron supplementation for iron deficient heart failure patients including potential improvements in depression. METHODS AND RESULTS: The databases of Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane library of systematic reviews, Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for studies with relevant patient outcomes. A total of 18 studies were identified and included in the review. In essence, intravenous iron was found to be beneficial for New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, quality of life measures, heart failure (HF) hospitalisation and aerobic capacity. Oral iron however was not beneficial. Research surrounding intravenous iron improving cardiovascular mortality, time to first hospitalisation and changes in depression status is lacking. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is required to elucidate the advantages of intravenous iron for iron deficient heart failure patients on their depression, mortality and first admission to hospital. Consensus is required regarding which form of iron and the treatment regime that should be adopted for future clinical guidelines.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Huang KW ; Bilgrami NL ; Hare DL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.hlc.2021.10.013 ","Keywords":"Depression/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\n*Heart Failure/complications/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nHumans\r\nIron\r\n*Iron Deficiencies\r\nQuality of Life\r\nSystematic Reviews as Topic\r\nDepression\r\nHeart failure\r\nIron deficiency\r\nIron infusion\r\nIron replacement\r\nPatient outcomes","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Huang KW, Bilgrami NL, and Hare DL (2022) Iron Deficiency in Heart Failure Patients and Benefits of Iron Replacement on Clinical Outcomes Including Comorbid Depression..

We found that the use of antidepressants more than doubled from 9.4 per 1000 enrollees to 21.3 per 1000. Most of this increase is associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which increased from 4.6 to 14.5 per 1000. The use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) decreased markedly, while the increase of other newer antidepressants rose from 1.3 to 6.5 per 1000. The use of anticonvulsants nearly doubled, from 3.5 to 6.9 per 1000, while lithium use was relatively stable at a rate of nearly 1 per 1000. Use of SSRIs, newer antidepressants, and anticonvulsants increased in boys as well as girls in each of three age groups: 5-9, 10-14, and 15-17 years. An increasing percentage of the antidepressant users had a diagnosis of depression, and an increasing percentage of anticonvulsant users had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Although the safety and efficacy of antidepressants in youths needs to be more firmly established, these findings may reflect progress in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hunkeler EM ; Fireman B ; Lee J ; Diamond R ; Hamilton J ; He CX ; Dea R ; Nowell WB ; Hargreaves WA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1089/cap.2005.15.26 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAnticonvulsants/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nCalifornia\r\nChild\r\nChild, Preschool\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInsurance, Health/statistics & numerical data/*trends\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMental Disorders/*drug therapy/epidemiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hunkeler EM, Fireman B, Lee J, Diamond R, Hamilton J, He CX, Dea R, Nowell WB, and Hargreaves WA (2005) Trends in use of antidepressants, lithium, and anticonvulsants in Kaiser Permanente-insured youths, 1994-2003..

In lithium-treated normal rats, increased striatal concentrations of neurokinin A (NKA)-like immunoreactivity (LI), substance P (SP-LI) and neuropeptide Y (NPY-LI) have been reported. To investigate whether these effects might be of therapeutic relevance, Flinders Sensitive Line rats (FSL), an animal model of depression, and control Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) rats were during a 6-week period fed chow to which either lithium or vehicle was admixed. Following sacrifice, the peptides were extracted from dissected brain regions and measured by radioimmunoassay. NKA-LI and SP-LI were markedly decreased in striatum and increased in frontal cortex in FSL compared to control FRL animals. Lithium treatment abolished these differences. Basal concentrations of NPY-LI were decreased in hippocampus of FSL rats, but unaffected by lithium. The present study suggests that changed tachykinins and NPY may underlie the characterized depressive-like phenotype of the FSL rats. It is hypothesized that altering tachykinin peptidergic neurotransmission in striatum and frontal cortex constitutes a mechanism of action of lithium and that such a mechanism might be of therapeutic relevance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Husum H ; Vasquez PA ; Mathé AA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/S0893-133X(00)00198-6 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrain/drug effects/*metabolism\r\nDepression/drug therapy/*metabolism\r\n*Disease Models, Animal\r\nLithium Chloride/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nNeuropeptide Y/drug effects/*metabolism\r\nRats\r\nSpecies Specificity\r\nTachykinins/drug effects/*metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Husum H, Vasquez PA, and Mathé AA (2001) Changed concentrations of tachykinins and neuropeptide Y in brain of a rat model of depression: lithium treatment normalizes tachykinins..

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) was suggested to play a role in the pathophysiology of depression. Consequently, we investigated in adult rats the effects of maternal deprivation for 3 h/day during postnatal days (PND) 2-14 and of dietary lithium during PND 50-83 on brain levels of NPY-like immunoreactivity (LI). Brain levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and serum corticosterone were also measured. Maternal deprivation reduced NPY-LI levels in the hippocampus and the striatum but increased NPY-LI and CRH-LI levels in the hypothalamus. Lithium treatment counteracted the effect of maternal deprivation in the hippocampus and striatum by increasing NPY-LI levels. In the hypothalamus, lithium tended to decrease CRH-LI but further increased levels of NPY-LI; it also increased serum corticosterone levels.

Mg replacement therapy can be effective to prevent some of the serious depression-like and anxiety-related behaviour sequelae of Mg deficiency. However, few experimental studies have been undertaken on Mg-deficiency-induced behavioural changes. Even fewer studies have been carried out on acute behavioural responses to clonidine, D-amphetamine, arecoline, nicotine, apomorphine, and L-5-hydroxytryptophan (HTP), which might characterize possible neuromediator changes in Mg deficiency. The effects of correcting Mg deficiency by magnesium chloride (MgCl₂ · 6H₂O) and the combination of this salt with vitamin B₆, on the behavioural manifestations of Mg deficiency have never been described as well. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were: to estimate effect of MgCl₂ · 6H₂O alone and in combination with vitamin B6 on acute behavioural responses to agonists or blockers of the main neurotransmitter systems in CNS, psychomotor activity and emotional status of rats fed with Mg-deficient diet for 49 days. In our study open field test has shown that in Mg-deficient rats locomotor activity and vertical activity, number of visiting and residence time in central squares were decreased significantly. In the elevated plus maze test, the number of visiting open arms and residence time of rats were significantly less as compared with the control group. In the forced swimming test, time immobile was significantly increased by 44.29% and time of swimming was decreased by 52.79% compared to control. RESULTS: In our study Mg-deficient rats were more sensitive to d-amphetamine-induced motor stereotypes. Mg deficiency antagonized 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced head-twitch response and arecoline-induced tremor. Supplement of MgCl₂ · 6H₂O with vitamin B₆ administered to a Mg-deficient rat increased the Mg level in plasma and erythrocytes. Furthermore, this increase was in relation to vitamin B₆ given to the animal. Mg supplementation alone and in combination with pyridoxine normalized acute behavioural responses to d-amphetamine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and arecoline in Mg deficient rats with a return to pre-deficient levels observed in the Mg sufficient group. DISCUSSION: Combination of Mg salts and pyridoxine hydrochloride can be effective at treating some behavior form of primary Mg deficiency.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Iezhitsa IN ; Spasov AA ; Kharitonova MV ; Kravchenko MS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1179/174313211X12966635733277 ","Keywords":"5-Hydroxytryptophan/administration & dosage\r\nAmphetamine/administration & dosage\r\nAnimals\r\nAnxiety/physiopathology\r\nApomorphine/administration & dosage\r\nArecoline/administration & dosage\r\nClonidine/administration & dosage\r\nDepression/physiopathology\r\nDiet\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nEmotions/*drug effects\r\nMagnesium/blood\r\nMagnesium Chloride/*pharmacology\r\nMagnesium Deficiency/*physiopathology/psychology\r\nMale\r\nNeurotransmitter Agents/metabolism\r\nNicotine/administration & dosage\r\nPsychomotor Performance/*drug effects\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nStereotyped Behavior/*drug effects\r\nVitamin B 6/blood/pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Iezhitsa IN, Spasov AA, Kharitonova MV, and Kravchenko MS (2011) Effect of magnesium chloride on psychomotor activity, emotional status, and acute behavioural responses to clonidine, d-amphetamine, arecoline, nicotine, apomorphine, and L-5-hydroxytryptophan..

Therefore, the present study investigated the long-term outcome of 26 antidepressant-refractory patients with depression, whom we had studied and treated in 1995. METHODS: Before being classified as nonresponse, these patients had been treated adequately with at least two tricyclic or heterocyclic antidepressants (a minimum of the equivalent of 150 mg of imipramine for 4 weeks). In 1995, 21 of 26 patients were diagnosed with unipolar depression, while 5 were diagnosed with bipolar depression. Mean follow-up was 5.7 years (range: 1-7 years) and changes in diagnosis, remission and treatment efficacy were evaluated. RESULTS: Following the long-term follow-up, 13 patients achieved full remission and demonstrated high social functioning (mean GAF score, 91). A further four depressed patients experienced full remission; however, subsequent recurrence was observed. In total, 17 of 26 patients experienced remission at least once during the long-term follow-up period despite the chronic depressive episodes observed at study entry. Adjuvant treatment with lithium, dopamine receptor agonists or thyroid hormone was effective for promoting full remission. Among the 21 patients initially diagnosed with unipolar depression in 1995, diagnoses were changed to bipolar disorder in 5 cases. LIMITATIONS: This naturalistic study had a relatively small sample size and treatment was not controlled. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up revealed that a substantial proportion of antidepressant-refractory depression is comprised of bipolar disorders.

METHODS: Before being classified as stage 2 treatment-resistant depression, these patients had been treated adequately with at least two tricyclic or heterocyclic antidepressants from different pharmacological classes (a minimum of the equivalent of 150 mg of imipramine for 4 weeks). During 1995-1997, 29 patients received lithium augmentation. Their treatment responses were recorded. Mean follow-up was 8.0 years (range, 1-13 years). Bipolar conversion and full remission were evaluated. RESULTS: After the long-term follow-up, diagnoses were changed to bipolar depression in 3 of 4 lithium responders and 3 of 25 lithium non-responders; lithium augmentation was more effective for unrecognized bipolar patients.

Despite the reported high overall efficacy, lithium has been relatively underused in recent years. Lamotrigine, a novel anticonvulsant recently recognized as a mood stabilizer, seems to have putative antidepressive properties. The aim of the study was to investigate lamotrigine efficacy and tolerability as antidepressant augmentation for unipolar treatment-resistant depression compared to lithium. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 88 patients suffering from treatment-resistant Major depressive disorder, having acute recurrent depressive episodes according to DSM-IV criteria, were enrolled in the study. This was an open-label trial with a flexible dosing regimen. All patients, received antidepressants in full therapeutic doses. They were divided into two augmentation groups: 46 patients received 50-200 mg/day lamotrigine, and 42 patients received 600-1200 mg/day lithium. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and The Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI) were used to monitor therapeutic efficacy. Patients were evaluated weekly for an 8 week treatment period. RESULTS: The HAM-D total score was significantly reduced in both treatment groups at the study endpoint, without any difference between the groups. However, significant clinical improvement was reached within the second treatment week in the lamotrigine group compared to the lithium group (p=0.01 vs. lithium). Lamotrigine showed significant efficacy on the HAM-D item 1(depressed mood; p=0.01), item 7 (work and interest; p=0.01) and CGI-Improvement scale (p=0.02). The drop-out rate due to treatment failure was lower in the lamotrigine group (n=1) compared to the lithium (n=4) group. Also, the incidence of side effects did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that lamotrigine could be useful as augmentation of antidepressants for treatment-resistant unipolar depression. Also, lamotrigine may accelerate the onset of antidepressant action, and therefore might be useful in treatment of major depression in general.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ivković M ; Damjanović A ; Jovanović A ; Cvetić T ; Jasović-Gasić M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnticonvulsants/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLithium Carbonate/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPersonality Inventory/statistics & numerical data\r\nPsychometrics\r\nSecondary Prevention\r\nTranquilizing Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nTriazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ivković M, Damjanović A, Jovanović A, Cvetić T, and Jasović-Gasić M (2009) Lamotrigine versus lithium augmentation of antidepressant therapy in treatment-resistant depression: efficacy and tolerability..

Limited experimental and clinical data suggest an association between magnesium and depression. Thus, there are reasons to consider dietary magnesium as a variable of interest in depressive disorders. The aim of the present study was to examine the association between magnesium intake and depression and anxiety in a large sample of community-dwelling men and women. This sample consisted of 5708 individuals aged 46-49 or 70-74 years who participated in the Hordaland Health Study in Western Norway. METHODS: Symptoms of depression and anxiety were self-reported using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and magnesium intake was assessed using a comprehensive food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: There was an inverse association between standardized energy-adjusted magnesium intake and standardized depression scores that was not confounded by age, gender, body habitus or blood pressure (beta=-0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI)=-0.22 to -0.11). The association was attenuated after adjustment for socioeconomic and lifestyle variables, but remained statistically significant (beta=-0.11, 95%CI=-0.16 to -0.05). Standardized magnesium intake was also related to case-level depression (odds ratio (OR)=0.70, 95%CI=0.56-0.88), although the association was attenuated when adjusted for socioeconomic and lifestyle factors (OR=0.86, 95%CI=0.69-1.08). The inverse relationship between magnesium intake and score and case-level anxiety was weaker and not statistically significant in the fully adjusted models. CONCLUSION: The hypothesis that magnesium intake is related to depression in the community is supported by the present findings. These findings may have public health and treatment implications.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jacka FN ; Overland S ; Stewart R ; Tell GS ; Bjelland I ; Mykletun A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/00048670802534408 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAnalysis of Variance\r\nAnxiety Disorders/blood/*epidemiology\r\nDepressive Disorder/blood/*epidemiology\r\nFeeding Behavior\r\nFemale\r\nHealth Surveys\r\nHumans\r\nLife Style\r\nMagnesium Deficiency/blood/*epidemiology\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNorway\r\nPersonality Inventory/statistics & numerical data\r\nPsychometrics\r\nReproducibility of Results\r\nSocioeconomic Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jacka FN, Overland S, Stewart R, Tell GS, Bjelland I, and Mykletun A (2009) Association between magnesium intake and depression and anxiety in community-dwelling adults: the Hordaland Health Study..

With the exception of lithium--which is the most demonstrably effective treatment against suicide-remarkably little is known about specific contributions of mood-altering treatments to minimizing mortality rates in persons with major mood disorders in general and bipolar depression in particular. Suicide is usually a manifestation of severe psychiatric distress that is often associated with a diagnosable and treatable form of depression or other mental illness.

However, patients may show a high level of heterogeneity in treatment response across the lifespan. In particular, the benefits of lithium use may vary in special clinical conditions. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by conducting an umbrella review on the efficacy and safety of lithium in childhood and adolescence, peripartum and old age. METHODS: We applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses criteria (PRISMA) to identify systematic reviews/meta-analyses on the efficacy and/or safety of lithium in mood disorders in special clinical conditions: (i) childhood and adolescence; (ii) peripartum (pregnancy, postpartum and lactation); (iii) old age. The Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Overlap in primary studies across systematic reviews was calculated through the Corrected Covered Area (CCA). RESULTS: We included 20 independent studies, for a total of 8209 individuals treated with lithium. Regarding paediatric age, efficacy and safety results suggested that lithium may be superior to placebo in bipolar disorders (BD) and not associated with serious adverse events. Nevertheless, primary available data are very limited. Efficacy in paediatric major depressive disorder (MDD) is not clear. During peripartum, lithium use was superior to non-lithium in preventing mood episodes and it was associated with low risk of congenital anomalies and with normal child neurodevelopment. Regarding old age, limited evidence supported lithium as an effective treatment in BD and resistant MDD; low doses should be used in this population. Systematic reviews on paediatric age showed the lowest risk of bias (80% of the studies at low risk). The CCA range of included studies was 13-47%. CONCLUSIONS: This umbrella review supports the use of lithium across the lifespan, including special clinical condition. Nevertheless, more studies with increased methodological homogeneity are needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Janiri D ; Sampogna G ; Albert U ; Caraci F ; Martinotti G ; Serafini G ; Tortorella A ; Zuddas A ; Fiorillo A ; Sani G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s40345-023-00287-7 ","Keywords":"Adolescence\r\nChildhood\r\nElderly\r\nLactation\r\nLithium\r\nOld age\r\nPaediatric\r\nPeripartum\r\nPostpartum\r\nPregnancy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Janiri D, Sampogna G, Albert U, Caraci F, Martinotti G, Serafini G, Tortorella A, Zuddas A, Fiorillo A, and Sani G (2023) Lithium use in childhood and adolescence, peripartum, and old age: an umbrella review..

However there is less data concerning the efficacy of giving lithium and antidepressant concurrently from the start of treatment. METHODOLOGY: The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of a combination of clomipramine+lithium (C+L) with that of clomipramine+placebo (C+P) in-patients with unipolar major depression, during the first 11 days of treatment. Secondary objectives were the assessment of effectiveness after 6 weeks and assessment of the safety of the combination clomipramine and lithium carbonate. C+L and C+P groups were compared for 6 weeks in a multicenter randomized trial of 141 patients hospitalized with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depression. Efficacy was evaluated using the standard MADRS and CGI scales. RESULTS: Analysis of the 'as treatment ITT' population showed: the percentage reduction in MADRS scores between D0 and D11 in this population was better in the C+L group but not statistically significant (C+L: 32.1 vs. C+P: 27.4, P=0.07). Nevertheless, the comparison of mean MADRS scores showed a significant difference in the C+L group on days 4 (C+L: 25.1 vs. C+P: 27.8) and 7 (C+L: 18.6 vs. C+P: 21.5), P<0.05, and approaching significance on day 11 (C+L: 14.6 vs. C+P 17.2, P=0.054). On day 7, the number of patients in total remission was threefold higher in the C+L group than in the C+P group (15 vs. 4%, P<0.05) and twofold on day 11 (29 vs. 14%, P<0.05). CGI severity score showed C+L was superior to C+P on days 4, 7 and 11 and CGI improvement score was better in C+L group on day 11 (P<0.05). After 6 weeks of treatment no statistical difference was found between the two groups from the clinical point of view. Safety based upon clinical and laboratory parameters was satisfactory in both groups during the 6 weeks of the study. LIMITATIONS: Patients with bipolar disorder, previously treated with clomipramine or with any other mood stabilizers during the previous week; or with suicide attempt during the current episode with a score > or =3 for item 10 of the MADRS were excluded from the study. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggests that lithium slightly to moderately potentiates antidepressant treatment in unipolar non-refractory patients with severe major depression in the first days of treatment but not as significantly as for the bipolar population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Januel D ; Poirier MF ; D'alche-Biree F ; Dib M ; Olié JP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0165-0327(02)00086-1 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/administration & \r\n      dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nClomipramine/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPlacebos\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Januel D, Poirier MF, D'alche-Biree F, Dib M, and Olié JP (2003) Multicenter double-blind randomized parallel-group clinical trial of efficacy of the combination clomipramine (150 mg/day) plus lithium carbonate (750 mg/day) versus clomipramine (150 mg/day) plus placebo in the treatment of unipolar major depression..

When used as adjunctive therapy, lithium augments the therapeutic effects of conventional antidepressants and is particularly useful in patients with resistant depression. The efficacy of the drug in the treatment of alcoholism has been a matter of controversy for several years; the most recent data suggest that the agent has limited, if any, utility in this population. More promising applications have emerged in the management of obsessive compulsive disorder. Some evidence has also suggested that lithium may possess antiviral properties. Side effects, particularly those involving the thyroid and kidney, continue to generate concern, and drug-drug interactions must also be considered whenever lithium is prescribed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jefferson JW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Alcoholism/drug therapy\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Interactions\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nVirus Diseases/drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jefferson JW (1990) Lithium: the present and the future..

Before the advent of modern pharmacotherapy, ECT was a common treatment; more recently, lithium has become the long-term treatment of choice, but it is a treatment that is not without complications. METHOD: The psychiatric and medical history of an 80-year-old patient was reviewed and analyzed based on clinical interview and medical records. The findings were integrated with literature review to illustrate a number of important clinical points about manic depressive disorder and its treatment. RESULTS: (1) ECT is an effective treatment for mania, (2) a sustained remission may occur spontaneously, (3) a mania-depression-euthymia episode sequence predicts favorable response to lithium, (4) lithium discontinuation is not without risk, (5) lithium continuation is not without risk (thyroid, kidneys, eyes). CONCLUSION: The case of Mrs. L illustrates the longitudinal course of manic depressive disorder and how it can be influenced by treatment and withdrawal of treatment. It also illustrates the potential of lithium for causing adverse effects on several organ systems.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jefferson JW ; Sen D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nBipolar Disorder/chemically induced/drug therapy/psychology/*therapy\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nHypothyroidism/chemically induced\r\nKidney Failure, Chronic/chemically induced\r\nLithium Carbonate/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nNephritis, Interstitial/chemically induced\r\nNystagmus, Pathologic/chemically induced\r\nPolyuria/chemically induced\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/etiology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nValproic Acid/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jefferson JW, and Sen D (1994) Manic depressive disorder and lithium over the decades: the very educational case of Mrs. L..

A patient's failure to respond to treatment may be due to any of a number of factors, such as noncompliance with a behavioral program, concurrent severe depression or personality disorder, certain ritualistic behaviors, inaccurate diagnosis, and inadequate treatment. It is particularly important that comorbid psychiatric disorders be diagnosed and treated. A review of the literature and my experience with the use of augmenting agents such as lithium, buspirone, clonidine, fenfluramine, antidepressants, anxiolytic agents, and neuroleptics in treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder are presented. Existing evidence suggests that some of these approaches are useful for some patients. However, many questions remain, and much research remains to be done on this topic.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jenike MA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3109/10673229309017053 ","Keywords":"*Behavior Therapy\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder/diagnosis/psychology/*therapy\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jenike MA (1993) Augmentation strategies for treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder..

The two treatment schedules were allocated at random. Using the Cox proportional hazard model for statistical analysis, the lithium dosing schedule of every second day did not maintain its prophylactic efficacy against recurrent episodes of manic-depressive disorder.

For initial treatment of mania, there were no significant differences across treatment guidelines. All guidelines recommended mood stabilizer (MS) or atypical antipsychotic (AAP) monotherapy or a combination of an MS with an AAP as a first-line treatment strategy for mania. However, the KMAP-BP 2018 did not prefer monotherapy with MS or AAP for psychotic mania. Quetiapine, olanzapine and aripiprazole were the first-line AAPs for nearly all phases of bipolar disorder across guidelines. Most guidelines advocated newer AAPs as first-line treatment options for all phases while lamotrigine was recommended for depressive and maintenance phases. Lithium and valproic acid were commonly used as MSs in all phases of bipolar disorder. As research evidence accumulated over time, recommendations of newer AAPs (such as asenapine, cariprazine, paliperidone, lurasidine, long-acting injectable risperidone and aripiprazole once monthly) became prominent. KMAP-BP 2018 guidelines were similar to other guidelines, reflecting current changes in prescription patterns for bipolar disorder based on accumulated research data. Strong preference for combination therapy was characteristic of KMAP-BP 2018, predominantly in the treatment of psychotic mania and severe depression.

The acute antidepressant effect of lithium alone is neither as impressive nor as predictable as its antimanic action, nor is it equivalent to that of tricyclic antidepressants. In patients who are 'refractory' to tricyclics or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, combined treatment with lithium may augment antidepressant response. Lithium is an effective prophylactic treatment in both unipolar and bipolar disorder and in the latter is the drug of choice. Aspects of monitoring, such as range of therapeutic plasma levels, dosage regimen and adverse effects, are discussed.

Treatment with intermittent doses of lithium (every second day) seems to reduce side effects, while maintaining clinical efficacy. Lithium has recently been used in combination with other medications. Augmentation of unsuccessful antidepressant treatment with lithium may produce an antidepressant effect within a short time.

This study was performed to timely revise KMAP-BP 2002. A questionnaire comprising 37 questions and 645 treatment options was developed for surveying the opinions of Korean experts. We classified the opinions into three categories: first-, second-, and third-line treatments. Fifty-three (75.7%) of the 70 selected experts answered the questionnaire. For an acute manic episode, the combination of a mood stabilizer (MS) and an atypical antipsychotic (AAP) was the preferred first-line treatment. Most experts recommended divalproex and lithium as MSs, and olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone as AAPs. For moderately to severely depressed bipolar patients, MS monotherapy and a combination of an MS and an antidepressant (AD) were considered to be preferred treatments respectively. A combination of an MS and an AD was the preferred strategy in severe nonpsychotic depression. Most ADs were rated as second-line drugs. Overall, the preference for lamotrigine and AAPs was higher than in KMAP-BP 2002. The algorithm was developed mainly using consensus among experts supplemented with findings of recent clinical trials to ensure that our algorithm was both up to date and balanced. These results suggest that the medication strategies of KMAP-BP are changing rapidly, reflecting recent studies and clinical experiences.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jon DI ; Bahk WM ; Yoon BH ; Shin YC ; Cho HS ; Lee E ; Ha K ; Kim W ; Chung SK ; Seo JS ; Min KJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15622970802144865 ","Keywords":"*Algorithms\r\nAnticonvulsants/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBenzodiazepines/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*epidemiology\r\nDibenzothiazepines/therapeutic use\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nHealth Personnel\r\nHumans\r\nKorea/epidemiology\r\nOlanzapine\r\nPsychiatry/statistics & numerical data\r\nQuetiapine Fumarate\r\nRisperidone/therapeutic use\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nTime Factors\r\nValproic Acid/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jon DI, Bahk WM, Yoon BH, Shin YC, Cho HS, Lee E, Ha K, Kim W, Chung SK, Seo JS, and Min KJ (2009) Revised Korean medication algorithm for bipolar disorder..

This study evaluated the changes in treatment strategies advocated by the KMAP-BP over time. METHODS: The five editions of the KMAP-BP were reviewed, and the recommendations of the KMAP-BP were compared with those of other bipolar disorder (BP) treatment guidelines. RESULTS: The most preferred option for the initial treatment of mania was a combination of a mood stabilizer (MS) and an atypical antipsychotic (AAP). Either MS or AAP monotherapy was also considered a first-line strategy for mania, but not for all types of episodes, including mixed/psychotic mania. In general, although lithium and valproic acid were commonly recommended, valproic acid has been increasingly preferred for all phases of BP. The most notable changes over time included the increasing preference for AAPs for all phases of BP, and lamotrigine for the depressive and maintenance phases. The use of antidepressants for BP has gradually decreased, but still represents a first-line option for severe and psychotic depression. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the recommended strategies of the KMAP-BP were similar to those of other guidelines, but differed in terms of the emphasis on rapid effectiveness, which is often desirable in actual clinical situations. The major limitation of the KMAP-BP is that it is a consensus-based rather than an evidence-based tool. Nevertheless, it may confer advantages in actual clinical practice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jon DI ; Woo YS ; Seo JS ; Lee JG ; Jeong JH ; Kim W ; Shin YC ; Min KJ ; Yoon BH ; Bahk WM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/bdi.12902 ","Keywords":"Algorithms\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nRepublic of Korea\r\nKMAP-BP\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nchanges\r\nconsensus\r\nguideline\r\ntreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jon DI, Woo YS, Seo JS, Lee JG, Jeong JH, Kim W, Shin YC, Min KJ, Yoon BH, and Bahk WM (2020) The Korean Medication Algorithm Project for Bipolar Disorder (KMAP-BP): Changes in preferred treatment strategies and medications over 16 years and five editions..

Despite this, trials reporting anxiety-related outcomes in this population are uncommon, particularly with regards to monotherapies. METHODS: Patients (n = 31) with both bipolar I or II disorder in current depressive episodes were enrolled in a six-week, open-label, single-center trial assessing the efficacy of lithium monotherapy in treating symptoms depression and comorbid anxiety. Patients were mostly medication-free and lithium-naïve at baseline. RESULTS: Significant improvements in depression (HAMD) and anxiety (HAM-A) were observed at the six-week endpoint, with remission and response rates greater than 50%. There was a positive correlation between endpoint HAM-A scores and HAM-D scores, r = 0.80, (p < 0.01). Improvements were realized at low serum lithium concentrations (0.49 ± 0.20 mEq/L). LIMITATIONS: Lack of placebo control and small sample size warrants validation in larger randomized studies. CONCLUSIONS: Taken in the context of prior evidence, lithium may have an important role in treating comorbid anxiety in bipolar disorder, both as adjunct and monotherapy. Lower doses of lithium may provide equivalent efficacy and enhance tolerability and compliance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jones G ; Rong C ; Vecera CM ; Gurguis CI ; Chudal R ; Khairova R ; Leung E ; Ruiz AC ; Shahani L ; Zanetti MV ; de Sousa RT ; Busatto G ; Soares J ; Gattaz WF ; Machado-Vieira R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2022.04.025 ","Keywords":"Anxiety/complications/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/complications/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nAnxiety\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nDepression\r\nLithium\r\nMonotherapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jones G, Rong C, Vecera CM, Gurguis CI, Chudal R, Khairova R, Leung E, Ruiz AC, Shahani L, Zanetti MV, de Sousa RT, Busatto G, Soares J, Gattaz WF, and Machado-Vieira R (2022) The role of lithium treatment on comorbid anxiety symptoms in patients with bipolar depression..

Long-term relapse prevention in bipolar disorder is challenging, with a significant number of patients relapsing following the initial stabilisation of mood. Initial treatment of the condition is complex and usually occurs in secondary care. Whilst there is no known cure for bipolar disorder, several therapies have been found to be effective in both managing acute episodes and sustaining long-term remission. The key pharmacological therapies in bipolar disorder are lithium salts, antiepileptics and antipsychotics and these will be the focus of this review. AIM: This review seeks to outline the key common pharmacological therapies used in the treatment and relapse prevention of this condition. METHODS: A MEDLINE search was performed, and the available literature was subsequently analysed, including meta-analyses, reviews and original clinical trials. RESULTS: Management strategies can be subdivided into treating acute presentations of mania and depression and maintaining long-term remission. The extensive side effect profile of several antipsychotics means that there are certain patient groups for whom they may be intolerable or contraindicated. Lithium emerges as a highly efficacious maintenance therapy but retains the burden of therapeutic drug monitoring. Antiepileptics play a crucial role in maintaining remission but are linked to serious, albeit rare, side effects. CONCLUSION: Despite the efficacy of the medications discussed in this article, their underlying mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. Nonetheless, these key therapies continue to be essential tools in the management of bipolar disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Joshi A ; Bow A ; Agius M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Joshi A, Bow A, and Agius M (2019) Pharmacological Therapies in Bipolar Disorder: a Review of Current Treatment Options..

In order to evaluate bipolar symptoms inadequately responsive to lithium, we have compared the effects of two structurally related compounds carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC). We evaluated the efficacy and safety of CBZ and OXC administration in residual symptoms as an adjunctive therapy in Bipolar I (BP I) and Bipolar II (BP II) patients while on lithium maintenance treatment. We selected from 153 bipolar patients in treatment those fulfilling Research Diagnostic Criteria for mania or hypomania, according to the SADS-L and conducted in 52 bipolar patients (27 BP I, 25 BP II) a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, single centre, clinical trial. Bipolar I and II outpatients, were randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio to OXC (n=26) or CBZ (n=26) for an 8-week period as add-on treatment to the existing lithium regimen. Outcome measures included the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 21 items (HDRS-21) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Clinical Global Impression severity (CGI-S) and improvement illness (CGI-I). These scales were administered at baseline and at the end of weeks 2, 4 and 8. All the fifty-two patients completed the trial. Overall, females were 35 (65%) and mean (S.D.) age was 39.4 (11.9) years; final doses at the end of week 8 in OXC group was 637.7 (210) mg/day and in the CBZ group 673.5 (179) mg/day; lithium plasma levels were 0.73 (0.25) meq/l and 0.71 (0.28) meq/l, respectively. Both OXC and CBZ were effective in reducing bipolar scores from baseline to endpoint (p<0.01). OXC was more effective than CBZ at weeks 4 and 8 on all 5 outcome measures. OXC resulted in greater significant mean reductions in YMRS, HDRS-21, MADRS, CGI-S and CGI-I scores from baseline to week 4 (p<0.05) and from baseline to week 8 (p<0.001), except YMRS (p<0.01). OXC appeared to be significantly more effective and with better tolerability than CBZ as add-on strategy treatment in BP I and BP II patients. This pilot, randomized clinical trial, suggests the potential usefulness of OXC as adjunctive therapy to lithium both in acute and long-term treatment of bipolar disorder. However, further adequately placebo-controlled trials are needed to expand these findings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Juruena MF ; Ottoni GL ; Machado-Vieira R ; Carneiro RM ; Weingarthner N ; Marquardt AR ; Fleig SS ; Broilo L ; Busnello EA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2008.10.012 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/blood/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nCarbamazepine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOxcarbazepine\r\nPilot Projects\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSeverity of Illness Index","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Juruena MF, Ottoni GL, Machado-Vieira R, Carneiro RM, Weingarthner N, Marquardt AR, Fleig SS, Broilo L, and Busnello EA (2009) Bipolar I and II disorder residual symptoms: oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine as add-on treatment to lithium in a double-blind, randomized trial..

METHOD: A Medline search was conducted for articles on pharmacological or psychosocial treatment of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents. RESULTS: There are no controlled studies with adequate sample size of the efficacy of lithium (or any other treatments) in bipolar children and adolescents. Two large open studies suggest that, overall, lithium is beneficial, but there also are reports of lithium resistance in bipolar children and adolescents. Small open studies suggest that mood-congruent delusions and hallucinations may be treated successfully with lithium alone. Data on adjuncts or alternatives to lithium in bipolar children and adolescents are sparse. Several controlled studies have been published on psychosocial treatment of child and adolescent depression, but none on mania. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological and psychosocial treatments of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents are understudied. There is a need for well-designed, controlled studies of lithium and alternative medications as well as adjunctive psychosocial treatments.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kafantaris V ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00004583-199506000-00013 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/psychology/*therapy\r\nChild\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nPsychotherapy/methods\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nRecurrence","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kafantaris V (1995) Treatment of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents..

METHODS: Eighteen clinically referred lithium-naive patients (mean age 15.5 years) were administered clinical rating scales and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) examinations at baseline and following 4 weeks of lithium treatment. Clinical ratings were repeated following 8 weeks of treatment. Patients with Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) ratings of 1 (\"very much improved\") or 2 (\"much improved\") were classified as responders. Ten healthy volunteers received baseline and follow-up DTI examinations. Using the ENIGMA pipeline, we investigated the relationship between changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) in the cingulum hippocampus (CGH) and clinical response to lithium. RESULTS: Patients demonstrated significantly lower FA compared to healthy volunteers in the left and right CGH white matter at baseline. Following 4 weeks of lithium treatment, FA in the left CGH increased in patients, but no significant changes in FA were observed among the untreated healthy volunteers. Lithium responders had a significantly greater increase in FA compared to non-responders. Moreover, baseline (pre-treatment) FA in the left CGH white matter significantly predicted week 8 overall CGI severity score, with post hoc analyses indicating that these effects were evident for both severity of depression and mania. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that response to lithium treatment in pediatric bipolar disorder is associated with normalization of white matter microstructure in regions associated with emotion processing.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kafantaris V ; Spritzer L ; Doshi V ; Saito E ; Szeszko PR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/bdi.12544 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAnisotropy\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nChild\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDiffusion Tensor Imaging/methods\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nPrognosis\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nWhite Matter/*diagnostic imaging\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ndiffusion tensor imaging\r\nlithium treatment\r\nneuroimaging\r\nwhite matter","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kafantaris V, Spritzer L, Doshi V, Saito E, and Szeszko PR (2017) Changes in white matter microstructure predict lithium response in adolescents with bipolar disorder..

Since that time, a variety of new treatments for bipolar disorder have been reported; however, evidence for these treatments varies widely, with data especially limited regarding comparisons between treatments and how to sequence them. For this reason, a new survey of expert opinion was undertaken to bridge gaps between the research evidence and key clinical decisions. The results of this new survey, which was completed by 58 experts, are presented in The Expert Consensus Guideline Series: Medication Treatment of Bipolar Disorder 2000, which was published in April 2000 as a Postgraduate Medicine Special Report. In this article, the authors describe the methodology used in the survey and summarize the clinical recommendations given in the resulting guidelines. The expert panel reached consensus on many key strategies, including acute and preventive treatment of mania (euphoric, mixed, and dysphoric subtypes), depression, rapid cycling, and approaches to managing treatment resistance and comorbid psychiatric conditions. Use of a mood stabilizer is recommended in all phases of treatment. Divalproex (especially for mixed or dysphoric subtypes) and lithium are the primary mood stabilizers for both acute and preventive treatment of mania. If monotherapy with these agents fails, the next recommended intervention is to combine them. This combination of lithium and divalproex can then serve as the foundation to which other medications are added if needed. Carbamazepine is the leading alternative mood stabilizer for mania. The experts rated the other new anticonvulsants as second-line options (i.e., their use is recommended if lithium, divalproex, and carbamazepine fail or are contraindicated). For milder depression, a mood stabilizer, especially lithium, may be used as monotherapy. Divalproex and lamotrigine are other first-line choices. For more severe depression, the experts recommend combining a standard antidepressant with lithium or divalproex. Bupropion, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and venlafaxine are preferred antidepressants. The antidepressants should usually be tapered 2-6 months after remission. Monotherapy with divalproex is recommended for the initial treatment of either depression or mania in rapid-cycling bipolar disorder. Antipsychotics are recommended for use in combination with the above regimens for mania or depression with psychosis, and as potential adjuncts in nonpsychotic episodes. Atypical antipsychotics, especially olanzapine and risperidone, were generally preferred over conventional antipsychotics. The guidelines also include recommendations concerning the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), clozapine, thyroid hormone, stimulants, and various novel agents for patients with treatment-refractory bipolar illness. The experts reached high levels of consensus on key steps in treating bipolar disorder despite obvious gaps in high-quality data. To evaluate many of the treatment options in this survey, the experts had to extrapolate beyond controlled data; however, their recommendations are generally conservative. Experts give their strongest support to initial strategies and medications for which high-quality research data or longstanding patterns of clinical usage exist. Within the limits of expert opinion and with the understanding that new research data may take precedence, these guidelines provide clear pathways for addressing common clinical questions and can be used to inform clinicians and educate patients about the relative merits of a variety of interventions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kahn DA ; Sachs GS ; Printz DJ ; Carpenter D ; Docherty JP ; Ross R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00131746-200007000-00004 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kahn DA, Sachs GS, Printz DJ, Carpenter D, Docherty JP, and Ross R (2000) Medication treatment of bipolar disorder 2000: a summary of the expert consensus guidelines..

In order to avoid preselection, no minimum period of lithium treatment was required in our study. Of a total of 6014 patient-years, 4330 were spent in regular contact with the study clinic. General mortality due to natural causes was not significantly increased; among cardiovascular diseases, only pulmonary embolism showed an excess mortality. No patients died of lithium intoxication or chronic renal insufficiency. Patients were divided into three groups: Group A, 277 patients, attended the study clinic until death or the end of the study, Group B, 86 patients, left the clinic but continued to take lithium, and Group C, 134 patients, both left the clinic and stopped taking lithium. Among bipolars, the suicide rate compared to the general population was in excess in all three groups. Among unipolars, suicides occurred only after the patients had left the study clinic and stopped taking lithium. A special analytical method was used for intergroup comparisons of suicide rates. Bipolars in Group A attending the study clinic regularly had a suicide rate of 3.5 per 1000 patient-years. The rate increased to 6.3 or by 80 % if patients had left the clinic and did not take lithium any longer as in Group C. The suicide rate in Group C increased by 45% compared to Group B, patients who left the clinic but continued to take lithium. Our results support the hypothesis that lithium has a significant antisuicidal effect in bipolars as well as in unipolars. The suicide mortality can be further reduced by regular attendance in a specialised mood disorder clinic.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kallner G ; Lindelius R ; Petterson U ; Stockman O ; Tham A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1055/s-2000-7965 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/mortality\r\nCause of Death\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMood Disorders/*drug therapy/*mortality/psychology\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSuicide/statistics & numerical data","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kallner G, Lindelius R, Petterson U, Stockman O, and Tham A (2000) Mortality in 497 patients with affective disorders attending a lithium clinic or after having left it..

The prevalence of BSD, BD-I, BD-II, and subthreshold BD globally is estimated to be about 3.1%, 1.5%,0.03%, and 1.6%, respectively. BD is a multidimensional disease that exhibits a range of moods of mania, hypomania, and depression. The disease is chronic, complex, and fatal, with a high possibility of reappearance, infirmity, social incompetence, and felo-de-se. Managing emotional disruption, negative neuropsychology, physiology, and immunology is a challenge. This review focuses on therapeutic benefits, adverse drug reactions, and pharmacological intervention for BD and BSD, in particular lithium. Long-term management of BD with a single medication is ineffective and therefore, not recommended. It is advised to use multiple agents for treatment instead. Medications include mood stabilizers (lithium and anticonvulsants), atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants. Along with medication provision, psychotherapy is of great significance for BD patients. The review was conducted on recent available scientific literature through the electronic database like Embase, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and PubMed using keywords like 'Bipolar Disease,' 'Bipolar Disease Therapeutics,' 'Bipolar Disease and Psychotherapy' to highlight the possible effective means of management of this disease of mood instability.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kamal ZM ; Dutta S ; Rahman S ; Etando A ; Hasan E ; Nahar SN ; Wan Ahmad Fakuradzi WFS; Sinha S ; Haque M ; Ahmad R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.7759/cureus.29332 ","Keywords":"bipolar disorders\r\nbipolar spectrum disorder\r\nfda-approved medications\r\nhistory of bipolar disorders\r\nintervention\r\nlithium\r\nnarrative review\r\nnhs approved medications\r\npharmacological treatment\r\ntreatment modalities","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kamal ZM, Dutta S, Rahman S, Etando A, Hasan E, Nahar SN, Wan Ahmad Fakuradzi WFS, Sinha S, Haque M, and Ahmad R (2022) Therapeutic Application of Lithium in Bipolar Disorders: A Brief Review..

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of valproate and lithium on mood stability either in monotherapy or in combination with atypical antipsychotics. METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis using data from a 52-week randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, that recruited 159 patients with recently remitted mania during treatment with lithium or valproate and adjunctive atypical antipsychotic therapy. Patients were randomized to discontinue adjunctive atypical antipsychotic at 0, 24 or 52 weeks. RESULTS: No significant differences in efficacy were observed between valproate and lithium (hazard ratio: 0.99; 95% confidence interval: [0.66, 1.48]) in time to any mood event. Valproate with 24 weeks of atypical antipsychotic was significantly superior to valproate monotherapy in preventing any mood relapse (hazard ratio: 0.46; 95% confidence interval: [0.22, 0.97]) while lithium with 24 weeks of atypical antipsychotic was superior to lithium monotherapy in preventing mania (hazard ratio: 0.27; 95% confidence interval: [0.09, 0.85]) but not depression. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study did not find significant differences in efficacy between the two mood-stabilizing agents when used as monotherapy or in combination with atypical antipsychotics. However, study design and small sample size might have precluded from detecting an effect if true difference in efficacy existed. Further head-to-head investigations with stratified designs are needed to evaluate maintenance therapies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kang MG ; Qian H ; Keramatian K ; Chakrabarty T ; Saraf G ; Lam RW ; Wong H ; Yatham LN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0004867419894067 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nCanada\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nKaplan-Meier Estimate\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSecondary Prevention\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nValproic Acid/*therapeutic use\r\nYoung Adult\r\nBipolar I disorder\r\nlithium\r\nolanzapine\r\nrisperidone\r\nvalproate","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kang MG, Qian H, Keramatian K, Chakrabarty T, Saraf G, Lam RW, Wong H, and Yatham LN (2020) Lithium vs valproate in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder: A post- hoc analysis of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial..

Lithium is the mainstay of treatment for Bipolar disorder (BD). There is limited literature on the clinical markers of Lithium treatment response from south Asia. METHODS: Two hundred and ten individuals with BD I and a history of at least 6 months of treatment with Lithium were recruited from the outpatient services of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) after obtaining informed consent. A diagnosis of BD I was made according to the DSM-IV criteria. The characterization of response to lithium prophylaxis was done using NIMH Retrospective Life Chart and \"Retrospective Criteria of Long Term Treatment Response in Research Subjects with Bipolar Disorder\" scale. RESULTS: There were 132 (62.86%) good responders and 78 (37.14%) non-responders. Good responders were noted to have less number of hospitalizations and more onset episode of depression than non-responders. Using continuous phenotype, Lithium response was inversely correlated with total number of episodes, number of episodes of mania/ depression, number of hospitalisations and presence of suicide attempt. Multivariate analysis only revealed number of episodes and hospitalization to be associated with Lithium response. CONCLUSION: Our Lithium response rates were higher than what have been reported in the few previous studies. Illness severity was the only factor associated with Lithium response. There is a need to examine this question in larger prospective samples and to focus on biological/ molecular markers of treatment response.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kapur V ; Nadella RK ; Sathur Raghuraman B; Saraf G ; Mishra S ; Srinivasmurthy N ; Jain S ; Del Zompo M ; Viswanath B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ajp.2018.04.006 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIndia\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nClinical predictors\r\nLithium\r\nTreatment response","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kapur V, Nadella RK, Sathur Raghuraman B, Saraf G, Mishra S, Srinivasmurthy N, Jain S, Del Zompo M, and Viswanath B (2019) Clinical factors associated with lithium treatment response in bipolar disorder patients from India..

Although the mechanisms whereby lithium exerts its augmentatory action have not been fully elucidated, the available evidence supports the hypothesis that lithium-induced enhancement of serotonergic neurotransmission is involved. Enhancement or stabilization of cholinergic neurotransmission, and inhibition of the phosphoinositide second messenger system may also be relevant. In view of lithium's well established efficacy as an antidepressant in its own right, it is also unclear whether a separate augmentatory mechanism needs to be invoked, rather than an additive synergistic action with concurrently administered conventional antidepressants. Several case reports suggest that lithium augmentation may be effective in otherwise extremely refractory cases of depression. Despite a number of methodological limitations, the body of evidence from open and placebo controlled clinical trials suggests strongly that a response rate to lithium augmentation of about 60 per cent may be expected. Further clinical trials are needed to clarify the characteristics of likely responders to lithium augmentation, and the use of neuroendocrine probes may be particularly useful in elucidating the neurotransmitter mechanisms involved.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Katona CL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBrain/drug effects\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Katona CL (1988) Lithium augmentation in refractory depression..

METHOD: Lithium or placebo was added on a double-blind basis for six weeks to the drug regime of 62 patients with major depressive illness (in both hospital and primary care settings) who had failed to respond to a controlled trial of fluoxetine or lofepramine. Response was defined as a final Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score of < 10. RESULTS: Response was seen more frequently in patients taking lithium (15/29) than in those remaining on antidepressant alone (8/32; P < 0.05). Rapid response to lithium augmentation (LA) was not consistently observed in this cohort. Mean HDRS scores after six weeks were significantly lower (P < 0.01) in the lithium group after excluding those who had not achieved significant exposure to lithium (arbitrarily defined as two or more lithium levels > or = 0.4 mmol/l). No differences in the efficacy of LA were apparent between fluoxetine and lofepramine. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that LA is a useful strategy in the treatment of antidepressant-resistant depression. Partial response was, however, frequently observed with continued antidepressant treatment alone, and the superiority of LA appears to depend on achieving adequate serum lithium levels.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Katona CL ; Abou-Saleh MT ; Harrison DA ; Nairac BA ; Edwards DR ; Lock T ; Burns RA ; Robertson MM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1192/bjp.166.1.80 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nDepressive Disorder/blood/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nFluoxetine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics\r\nLofepramine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Katona CL, Abou-Saleh MT, Harrison DA, Nairac BA, Edwards DR, Lock T, Burns RA, and Robertson MM (1995) Placebo-controlled trial of lithium augmentation of fluoxetine and lofepramine..

In this open-label, pilot, acute-treatment study, we sought to determine the safety and tolerability of lithium administered at 20 mg/ kg/day. A secondary aim was to provide preliminary data regarding the efficacy of this strategy in ameliorating manic, depressive, and psychotic symptoms. METHODS: Fifteen patients hospitalized with DSM-IV bipolar disorder, manic or mixed, and who provided written informed consent, received lithium 20 mg/kg/day for up to 10 days. Patients were evaluated for adverse effects daily. Lithium levels were obtained on days 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 10 or at study termination. Electrocardiograms (EKGs) were performed at baseline and on days 1-5, 7, and 10 or at study termination. Symptomatic improvement was assessed daily using the Young Mania Rating Scale, 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS). RESULTS: Five of the 15 patients completed the 10-day study period. Two patients dropped out due to adverse events. Seven patients did not complete the inpatient trial because of improvement sufficient to allow hospital discharge. All patients achieved serum lithium concentrations > or =0.6 mEq/L after 1 day of treatment; the mean + SD concentration on day 5 was 1.1 (+/- 0.1) mEq/L on day 5. There were significant reductions from baseline to endpoint on all rating scales, except the SAPS bizarre behavior subscale. CONCLUSIONS: These pilot data suggest that lithium 20 mg/kg/day was well tolerated and that this strategy may produce rapid improvement in affective and psychotic symptoms. These impressions require confirmation in double-blind, randomized trials.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Keck PE Jr; Strakowski SM ; Hawkins JM ; Dunayevich E ; Tugrul KC ; Bennett JA ; McElroy SL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1034/j.1399-5618.2001.030204.x ","Keywords":"Acute Disease\r\nAdult\r\nAntimanic Agents/administration & dosage/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Tolerance\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/administration & dosage/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nPilot Projects\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nTime Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Keck PE Jr, Strakowski SM, Hawkins JM, Dunayevich E, Tugrul KC, Bennett JA, and McElroy SL (2001) A pilot study of rapid lithium administration in the treatment of acute mania..

The outpatient presenting with bipolar disorder often presents with many of the key problems related to the long-term course of the disorder, including misdiagnosis and treatment non-adherence. Depressive symptoms are also prevalent during the course of bipolar disorder, with studies finding that depression can cause a low-grade \"darkness\" that longitudinally affects outpatients with bipolar disorder. These variable and persistent depressive symptoms may cause severe functional impairment and increased suicidality. Pharmacologic treatment of bipolar disorder typically includes anti-manic and mood-stabilizing medication. Although some studies find antidepressants have some positive effect, researchers have found that antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, when used as monotherapy or in conjunction with mood stabilizers, have little benefit for the treatment of bipolar disorder and may increase the likelihood of a switch into mania, hypomania, or mixed episodes. For long-term outpatient treatment, lamotrigine and lithium are proven to be highly effective. However, clinicians should also stress psychosocial treatment approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, as a principle of chronic disease management for long-term outpatients. Data on pharmacotherapy and psychosocial treatments are emerging, and clinicians should integrate these two treatment options into the standard of care. This expert roundtable supplement focuses on the treatment and management of the bipolar outpatient at risk for a depressive relapse as well as patients experiencing both acute and long-term symptoms of the disorder. Two case studies are presented to elucidate the best practices for the varying clinical states of bipolar disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Keck PE Jr; McIntyre RS ; Shelton RC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/classification/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/chemically induced/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nHumans\r\nMental Health Services/*organization & administration/standards\r\nPeriodicity","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Keck PE Jr, McIntyre RS, and Shelton RC (2007) Bipolar depression: best practices for the outpatient..

METHODS: Various search engines were used to find treatment guidelines for bipolar depression. The references cited in these guidelines were examined and analyzed in-depth. RESULTS: Ten guidelines recommend lithium as a first-line treatment for bipolar depression. Five did not recommend lithium at all for the treatment of bipolar depression. These discrepancies are remarkable. The references cited in the treatment guidelines were examined and do not favor lithium as a treatment for bipolar depression. The guidelines that favored lithium for the treatment of bipolar depression suffered numerous Woozle effects, reference inflation and belief perseverance are prevalent in guidelines that recommend lithium as a first-line treatment.

Of 31 patients (21%) randomly assigned to double-blind maintenance treatment, 55% (N = 17) relapsed (24% [N = 4] into depression and 76% [N = 13] into a manic/hypomanic/mixed episode), 26% (N = 8) completed the study, and 19% (N = 6) were poorly adherent or exited prematurely. The median time to recurrence of a new mood episode was 15.9 weeks for patients receiving lithium monotherapy and 17.8 weeks for patients receiving the combination of lithium and divalproex (not significant). The rate of relapse into a mood episode for those receiving lithium monotherapy or the combination of lithium and divalproex was 56% (N = 9) and 53% (N = 8), respectively. The rate of depressive relapse in both arms was 13% (N = 2), while the rate of relapse into a manic, hypomanic, or mixed episode was 44% (N = 7) for lithium monotherapy and 40% (N = 6) for the combination of lithium and divalproex. CONCLUSION: A small subgroup of patients in this study stabilized after 6 months of treatment with lithium plus divalproex. Of those who did, the addition of divalproex to lithium conferred no additional prophylactic benefit over lithium alone. Although depression is regarded as the hallmark of rapid-cycling bipolar disorder in general, these data suggest that recurrent episodes of mania tend to be more common in presentations accompanied by comorbid substance use.

This study assessed the antidepressant effects of lamotrigine as compared with placebo when used as add-on therapy for rapid-cycling bipolar depression non-responsive to the combination of lithium plus divalproex. METHODS: During Phase 1 of this trial, hypomanic, manic, mixed, and/or depressed outpatients (n = 133) aged 18-65 years with DSM-IV RCBD type I or II were initially treated with the open combination of lithium and divalproex for up to 16 weeks. During Phase 2, subjects who did not meet the criteria for stabilization (n = 49) (i.e., remained in or cycled into the depressed phase) were randomly assigned to double-blind, adjunctive lamotrigine (n = 23) or adjunctive placebo (n = 26). The primary endpoint was the mean change in depression symptom severity from the beginning of Phase 2 to the end of Phase 2 (week 12) on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Data were analyzed by analysis of covariance with last observation carried forward and a mixed-models analysis. RESULTS: During Phase 1, a high rate of study discontinuations occurred due to intolerable side effects (13/133; 10%) and study non-adherence (22/133; 17%). Only 14% (19/133) stabilized on the open combination of lithium and divalproex. Among the 49 (37%) patients randomized to the double-blind adjunctive treatment phase, mean ± standard error change from baseline on the MADRS total score was -8.5 ± 1.7 points for lamotrigine and -9.1 ± 1.5 points for placebo (p = not significant; mixed-models analysis). No significant differences were observed in the rates of response, remission, or bimodal response between lamotrigine and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The poor tolerability, lack of efficacy, and high rate of early discontinuation with the combination of lithium and divalproex suggests this regimen was ineffective for the majority of patients with RCBD. Among patients who did not stabilize on lithium and divalproex, the addition of lamotrigine was no more effective than placebo in reducing depression severity. The findings suggest an opportunity for several design modifications to enhance signal detection in future trials of RCBD. The main limitation is the small number of subjects randomized to double-blind treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kemp DE ; Gao K ; Fein EB ; Chan PK ; Conroy C ; Obral S ; Ganocy SJ ; Calabrese JR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/bdi.12013 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAntimanic Agents/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/blood/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLithium Chloride/blood/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nTriazines/blood/therapeutic use\r\nValproic Acid/blood/therapeutic use\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kemp DE, Gao K, Fein EB, Chan PK, Conroy C, Obral S, Ganocy SJ, and Calabrese JR (2012) Lamotrigine as add-on treatment to lithium and divalproex: lessons learned from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in rapid-cycling bipolar disorder..

Recovery, complete remission of symptoms, and a return to baseline psychosocial function, should be the goal of therapy. Poor response to adequate antidepressant treatment has been termed treatment resistant depression (TRD). Issues such as adherence, missed diagnosis of psychotic depression, bipolar disorder, or comorbid anxiety must be investigated as reasons why patients have not responded to initial therapeutic strategies. Beyond ensuring optimal use of the index antidepressant, treatment strategies for TRD include switching to another antidepressant, and augmentation or combination with two or more agents. Since little comparative data exist it is important to consider side-effect burden, partial response, and previous medication history when deciding between strategies. In patients with TRD, adding or augmenting with lithium, tri-iodothyronine or atypical antipsychotics have demonstrated benefits. Augmentation with atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, and quetiapine, show promising results in terms of improving remission rates. Other interventions, including non-pharmacologic strategies and investigational physical treatments, have demonstrated some benefits, but availability and patient preference should also be considered. With today's therapeutic alternatives, full remission of depression is an attainable goal. For some patients, combination and augmentation strategies earlier in treatment may increase the likelihood of remission.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kennedy SH ; Lam RW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1399-2406.2003.00058.x ","Keywords":"Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety Disorders/diagnosis/drug therapy\r\nComorbidity\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nDiagnosis, Differential\r\n*Drug Resistance\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nElectroshock\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nPhysical Therapy Specialty\r\nPsychotherapy\r\n*Treatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kennedy SH, and Lam RW (2003) Enhancing outcomes in the management of treatment resistant depression: a focus on atypical antipsychotics..

Despite increasing evidence that full symptomatic remission is the optimal goal of antidepressant therapy, there have been few comparisons between disparate treatment approaches to achieve this goal. METHOD: Forty-four patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD) who had a partial response (17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D-17] score of 8-15) during open-label antidepressant treatment for 8 to 14 weeks were randomly assigned to receive cognitive therapy (CT) or lithium augmentation (LA) for a further 8 weeks using a single-blind design. Antidepressant medication was continued throughout the study. Subjects were also reassessed 4 weeks after discontinuation of LA or CT. Patients were enrolled in this study beginning September 1996 and follow-up for all patients was completed in December 2000. RESULTS: Although LA or CT did not significantly decrease symptom severity during sequential combination therapy, there was a significant decrease in HAM-D-17 scores 4 weeks later in LA-treated subjects compared with CT-treated subjects (p =.04). This resulted in 32% of patients achieving remission status, although between-group differences were not significantly different (38% in the LA group compared with 26% in the CT group, p =.39). CONCLUSION: Despite methodological limitations, this preliminary study provides justification for both combination treatments. An adequately powered, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the relative merits of combination psychotherapy and augmentation of pharmacotherapy in patients with partially remitted MDD is required.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kennedy SH ; Segal ZV ; Cohen NL ; Levitan RD ; Gemar M ; Bagby RM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/jcp.v64n0414 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/diagnosis/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPersonality Inventory\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSecondary Prevention\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSingle-Blind Method\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kennedy SH, Segal ZV, Cohen NL, Levitan RD, Gemar M, and Bagby RM (2003) Lithium carbonate versus cognitive therapy as sequential combination treatment strategies in partial responders to antidepressant medication: an exploratory trial..

Combination therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acute manic states include the use of second-generation antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and aripiprazole in combination with lithium or divalproex; for the treatment of acute bipolar depression, the olanzapine plus fluoxetine combination; and for maintenance treatment, quetiapine combined with lithium or valproate. When combining medications for the management of patients with bipolar disorders, physicians face a potentially complex treatment strategy. Available agents have different mechanisms of action, routes of metabolism and excretion, therapeutic effects, and side effects. Combining treatments can be advantageous owing to therapeutic synergy; however, the liability is an increased possibility of adverse effects. The decision to use a combination therapy should be made on the basis of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of each medication and their specific combination for individual patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ketter TA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Acute Disease\r\nAffect/drug effects\r\nAnticonvulsants/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nCarbamazepine/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Interactions\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFluoxetine/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use\r\nPractice Guidelines as Topic\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nUnited States\r\nUnited States Food and Drug Administration\r\nValproic Acid/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ketter TA (2008) Monotherapy versus combined treatment with second-generation antipsychotics in bipolar disorder..

The Clinical and Health Outcomes Initiative in Comparative Effectiveness for Bipolar Disorder (Bipolar CHOICE) study was the first comparative effectiveness assessment of lithium versus quetiapine (in combination with adjunctive personalized treatment), and found no overall significant differences in efficacy and safety/tolerability outcomes between lithium and quetiapine. Completion of Bipolar CHOICE offers a timely opportunity to review the evidence regarding lithium and quetiapine for bipolar disorder. METHODS: Controlled clinical trials and real-world observational studies that included quetiapine and lithium as monotherapy or as combination therapy were identified by literature search. Selected studies were reviewed in detail. RESULTS: Review of the available trials suggested comparable efficacy of quetiapine and lithium in acute mania, and possibly greater efficacy for quetiapine compared with lithium in acute bipolar depression and in prevention of recurrent (particularly depressive) episodes. Combination therapy including quetiapine and lithium was generally more effective than either agent alone in acute mania and bipolar maintenance, although adding lithium to quetiapine did not increase efficacy in acute bipolar depression. Safety data for quetiapine and lithium were consistent with the established profiles of the two treatments. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include those of the available efficacy and effectiveness trial data. CONCLUSIONS: Quetiapine and lithium have overlapping but distinctive roles in different phases of bipolar disorder, and further studies of these agents (particularly in combination with one another) are warranted.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ketter TA ; Miller S ; Dell'Osso B ; Wang PW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2015.11.002 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nObservational Studies as Topic\r\nQuetiapine Fumarate/*therapeutic use\r\nYoung Adult\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nLithium\r\nQuetiapine\r\nRandomized controlled trial\r\nReal-world practice","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ketter TA, Miller S, Dell'Osso B, and Wang PW (2016) Treatment of bipolar disorder: Review of evidence regarding quetiapine and lithium..

IONPs were synthesized by curcumin as a reducing agent producing Cur-IONPs. Rats were divided into control, depression rat model, and depressed rats treated with Cur-IONPs. After treatment rat behavior was evaluated using forced swimming test (FST). Serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), monoamine oxidase (MAO), acetylcholinesterase (AchE), Na(+), K(+), ATPase, lipid peroxidation (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and nitric oxide (NO) were measured in the cortex and hippocampus. In depressed rats, FST showed increased immobilization time and reduced swimming time. This was associated with a significant decrease in 5-HT, NE, DA and GSH and a significant increase in MDA and NO levels and GST, MAO, AchE and Na(+), K(+), ATPase activities in the cortex and hippocampus. Treatment with Cur-NONPs for two weeks increased the swimming time reduced the immobility time, and elevated 5-HT, NE and DA levels. Cur-IONPs attenuated the oxidative stress induced by reserpine and restored the MAO, AchE and Na(+), K(+), ATPase. The present green method used curcumin in the IONPs synthesis and has several merits; obtaining nanoform of iron oxide, increasing the bioavailability of curcumin and reducing the oxidative stress induced by iron. The present antidepressant effect of Cur-IONPs could be attributed to the ability of Cur-IONPs to restore monoamine neurotransmitter levels by increasing their synthesis and reducing their metabolism. In addition, the antioxidant activity of curcumin prevented oxidative stress in the depressed rats.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Khadrawy YA ; Hosny EN ; Magdy M ; Mohammed HS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.174384 ","Keywords":"*Acetylcholinesterase\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents\r\n*Curcumin\r\nDepression\r\nLipid Peroxidation\r\nRats\r\nCur-IONPs\r\nDepression\r\nMonoamine neurotransmitters\r\nOxidative stress\r\nRats","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Khadrawy YA, Hosny EN, Magdy M, and Mohammed HS (2021) Antidepressant effects of curcumin-coated iron oxide nanoparticles in a rat model of depression..

Lithium is effective for treating recurrent mood disorders or treatment-resistant depression, and lithium augmentation treatment is also useful for treatment-resistant depression. However, the treatment effect of lithium on the depressive behavior of WKY rats remains poorly understood, and whether lithium augments the treatment effect of antidepressants in WKY rats is also unknown. In this study, we evaluated the treatment effect of lithium in WKY rats. We also sought to determine if lithium treatment augments the treatment effect of fluoxetine. Lithium was administered for 15 consecutive days and fluoxetine was administered 23.5, 5, and 1 h before the forced swim test (FST) day 2, based on previous studies. Lithium treatment counteracted depressive behavior in the FST and increased hippocampal neurogenesis. Additionally, co-administration of lithium and fluoxetine augmented the treatment effect observed in the FST and in hippocampal neurogenesis in WKY rats, although fluoxetine monotherapy showed no treatment effect. Lithium prevented an increase in body weight, similar to its effect in human patients. These results are consistent with those of lithium augmentation treatment for human patients with treatment-resistant depression. They suggest that WKY rats are a promising animal model for treatment-resistant depression. However, lithium treatment has various side effects. A new treatment with the same anti-depressive effect as fluoxetine + lithium treatment and fewer side effects compared with lithium would be desirable for patients with treatment-resistant depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kin K ; Yasuhara T ; Kawauchi S ; Kameda M ; Hosomoto K ; Tomita Y ; Umakoshi M ; Kuwahara K ; Kin I ; Kidani N ; Morimoto J ; Sasaki T ; Date I ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.brainres.2019.04.001 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology\r\nDepression/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*drug therapy/*metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFluoxetine/pharmacology\r\nHippocampus/drug effects\r\nLithium/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nNeurogenesis/drug effects\r\nRats\r\nRats, Inbred WKY\r\nSerotonin/pharmacology\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/pharmacology\r\nDepression\r\nFluoxetine\r\nHippocampus\r\nLithium\r\nNeurogenesis\r\nWistar Kyoto rat","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kin K, Yasuhara T, Kawauchi S, Kameda M, Hosomoto K, Tomita Y, Umakoshi M, Kuwahara K, Kin I, Kidani N, Morimoto J, Sasaki T, and Date I (2019) Lithium counteracts depressive behavior and augments the treatment effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in treatment-resistant depressed rats..

Antidepressant drugs have limited effectiveness. Depression can be triggered by immune/inflammatory factors. Zinc and paracetamol interfere with immune system and have demonstrated beneficial effects on depression treatment when administered concomitant with antidepressant drugs. The objective of this study was to test zinc and/or paracetamol as treatments of depressive-like behavior, sickness behavior, and anxiety in rats, as well as to understand the central and peripheral mechanisms involved. Sickness behavior and depressive-like behavior were induced in rats with repetitive lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mg/kg for two consecutive days) administrations. Rats received zinc and/or paracetamol for three consecutive days. Sickness behavior (daily body weight and open field general activity); anxiety (light-dark test); depressive-like/antidepressant behavior (forced swim test); plasma corticosterone and interferon (IFN)-gamma levels; and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) brain expression were evaluated. LPS induced sickness behavior and depressive-like behavior, as well as elevated IFN-gamma levels and increased GFAP expression. Zinc prevented both behavioral and biochemical impairments. Paracetamol and zinc + paracetamol association induced only slight beneficial effects. Anxiety, corticosterone, and TH do not seem be related with depression and the other behavioral and neuroimmune changes. In conclusion, zinc treatment was beneficial for sickness behavior and depressive-like behavior without concomitant administration of antidepressants. IFN-gamma and GFAP were linked with the expression of sickness behavior and depressive-like behavior and were also involved with the antidepressant effects. Therefore, zinc, IFN-gamma, and GFAP pathways should be considered for depression treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kirsten TB ; Cabral D ; Galvão MC ; Monteiro R ; Bondan EF ; Bernardi MM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbi.2020.01.019 ","Keywords":"Acetaminophen\r\nAnimals\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nGliosis\r\n*Illness Behavior\r\n*Interferon-gamma\r\nLipopolysaccharides\r\nRats\r\nZinc\r\nAnxiety\r\nCorticosterone\r\nDepression\r\nGFAP\r\nLPS\r\nParacetamol","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kirsten TB, Cabral D, Galvão MC, Monteiro R, Bondan EF, and Bernardi MM (2020) Zinc, but not paracetamol, prevents depressive-like behavior and sickness behavior, and inhibits interferon-gamma and astrogliosis in rats..

METHODS: We searched Embase, PubMed, and CENTRAL from inception until April 28, 2020. Outcomes included recurrence rate of any mood episode, depressive episodes, and manic/hypomanic/mixed episodes; all-cause discontinuation rate; and discontinuation rate due to adverse events. A random-effects model, single-group summary meta-analysis was conducted. A meta-regression analysis to examine whether the modifiers (total number of patients, %female, mean age, duration of study, duration of preliminary phase, publication year, bipolar disorder type, mood status at recruitment, presence of a placebo arm, sponsorship, enrichment design, number of treatment arms, and risk of bias for blinding or randomization) were associated with the event rate of the outcomes was also performed. RESULTS: We identified 21 randomized trials (n = 1,415; mean study duration, 78.40 ± 32.10 weeks; %female, 54.85%; mean age, 43.47 ± 4.88 years). The event rates (95% confidence interval [CI]) were as follows: recurrence of any mood episode, 39.8% (32.8%, 47.1%); depressive episodes, 25.6% (18.8%, 34.0%); manic/hypomanic/mixed episodes, 18.5% (13.7%, 24.7%); all-cause discontinuation rate, 67.0% (57.2%, 75.5%); and discontinuation rate due to adverse events, 8.7% (5.1%, 14.7%). After adjusting for multiple testing, our meta-regression analysis showed association only between the all-cause discontinuation rate and presence of a placebo arm. CONCLUSIONS: The recurrence rate of depressive episodes seemed to be higher than the recurrence rate of manic/hypomanic/mixed episodes. The all-cause discontinuation rate was high. However, the studies included in our meta-analysis were of short duration.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kishi T ; Sakuma K ; Okuya M ; Matsuda Y ; Esumi S ; Hashimoto Y ; Hatano M ; Miyake N ; Miura I ; Miyahara K ; Fujita K ; Kawashima K ; Mishima K ; Iwata N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/JCP.0000000000001264 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAffect/*drug effects\r\nAntimanic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nRecurrence\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kishi T, Sakuma K, Okuya M, Matsuda Y, Esumi S, Hashimoto Y, Hatano M, Miyake N, Miura I, Miyahara K, Fujita K, Kawashima K, Mishima K, and Iwata N (2020) Recurrence of Mania or Depression Among Adult Bipolar Patients Who Continued Using Lithium: A Single-group Summary Meta-analysis of Randomized Trials..

Lithium (10-100 mg/kg, p.o.), however, had no affect on the performance of rats in the forced swim test. ACTH (100 microg/day), administered subcutaneously to rats for 1, 3, 7, and 14 days, had no apparent effect on the duration of immobility in this test. The immobility-decreasing effect induced by a single administration of either imipramine (10-30 mg/kg, i.p.) or desipramine (30 mg/kg, i.p.) was blocked by chronic administration of ACTH for 3-14 days. The reduction of immobility, induced by chronic administration of imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) for 15 days, was blocked by treatment with ACTH for 14 days. When lithium (100 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered for 15 days concurrently with imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), we observed a significant decrease in immobility in rats treated with ACTH for 14 days.

The patients under lithium maintenance therapy showed no clearcut changes in effective and cognitive functions. Some statistically significant correlations were found between rising thyrotropin levels and improved affective function.

In order to investigate the efficacy of the two drugs in clearly defined subsamples, a series of subgroup analyses was carried out. First, patients with a bipolar I disorder (n = 114) were analyzed separately. In these patients, lithium was superior to carbamazepine. In contrast, carbamazepine was at least equally as efficacious as lithium in the subsample of patients with bipolar II disorder or bipolar disorder not otherwise specified (n = 57). In a second analysis on differential efficacy, the whole sample was subdivided into a classical subgroup (bipolar I patients without mood-incongruent delusions and without comorbidity; n = 67) and a nonclassical subgroup including all other patients (n = 104). Classical bipolar patients had a significantly lower hospitalization rate under lithium than under carbamazepine prophylaxis (26 vs. 62%, p = 0.012). For the nonclassical group, a tendency in favor of carbamazepine was found. In a third step, we analyzed the impact of episode sequence on differential efficacy. In a global view, the episode sequence prior to the index episode was not correlated to differential efficacy. Our results might, however, indicate that patients with an episode sequence of mania-depression-free interval responded better to lithium. Besides differential efficacy, suicidal behavior and patients' satisfaction with treatment were investigated. Regarding suicidal behavior, a trend in favor of lithium was found. The data on patients' satisfaction were significantly in favor of carbamazepine. In conclusion, lithium appears to be superior to carbamazepine in classical bipolar cases and might have additional impact on proneness to suicide. The distinctly larger group of patients with nonclassical features might profit more from carbamazepine which seems to be well accepted by the patients. Hence, treatment alternatives to lithium are desirable for the majority of bipolar patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kleindienst N ; Greil W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000054844 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*prevention & control/psychology\r\nCarbamazepine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPatient Compliance\r\nPatient Dropouts\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSuicide/psychology\r\nTreatment Failure","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kleindienst N, and Greil W (2000) Differential efficacy of lithium and carbamazepine in the prophylaxis of bipolar disorder: results of the MAP study..

The aim of this study is to explore the cost-effectiveness of quetiapine compared with other alternatives for the treatment of acute manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, with a specific focus on serious side effects. Four trials investigating quetiapine monotherapy and adjunctive therapy were performed to investigate the efficacy of quetiapine in patients with bipolar I disorder. Data were derived from The Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study and used to construct a study population for the model. To assess the cost-effectiveness of quetiapine in the management of acute mania in bipolar I disorders, a discrete event simulation model of seven monotherapy and combination treatment options was developed. A comparison of the total costs demonstrates that all of the monotherapy options and placebo are more costly than the combination therapy options. The combinations of lithium with risperidone (euro2365) and with olanzapine (euro2429) are estimated to be less costly per patient than the combination of lithium with quetiapine (euro2555). A group of 10,000 patients switching from olanzepine/lithium to quetiapine/lithium would involve extra costs of euro1,260,000, but would prevent an estimated number of 362 serious side effects. Switching from risperidone/lithium to quetiapine/lithium would cost an additional euro1,900,000 and would prevent 1580 serious side effects. In terms of serious side effects, the combination of lithium/quetiapine was superior to the combination of lithium with olanzapine or risperidone. It must be considered whether the decreased likelihood of developing a severe side effect is worth the extra costs incurred with the combination of quetiapine/lithium.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Klok RM ; Al Hadithy AF ; van Schayk NP ; Antonisse AJ ; Caro JJ ; Brouwers JR ; Postma MJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1586/14737167.7.5.459 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Klok RM, Al Hadithy AF, van Schayk NP, Antonisse AJ, Caro JJ, Brouwers JR, and Postma MJ (2007) Pharmacoeconomics of quetiapine for the management of acute mania in bipolar I disorder..

Therefore strategies for subsequent treatment steps are necessary. However, there is a lack of direct comparisons of these different strategies. In this naturalistic study we compared the outcome to different strategies after failure of the primary antidepressant treatment. METHODS: Failure of primary antidepressant monotherapy occurred in 135 patients. 98 of these patients have been administered 4 treatment strategies of the physicians' choice: lithium augmentation (Li-Augm), switching to another antidepressant (AD-Switch), combination of 2 antidepressants (AD-Comb) or augmentation with second generation antipsychotic (SGA-Augm). Primary outcome measure was the 17-item Hamilton rating scale for depression (HRSD). RESULTS: Patients who received Li-Augm or augmentation with SGAs showed significantly greater improvement in HRSD and BDI compared to patients with antidepressant switch or antidepressant combination. Remission rates for Li-Augm and SGA-Augm were 89.3% and 86.2% compared to 40.7% for AD-Switch and 42.9% for AD-Comb. DISCUSSION: Changing to another pharmacological class (Li-Augm or augmentation with SGAs) showed better treatment results than sticking to the class of antidepressants (AD-Switch and AD-Comb) after primary failure in response to antidepressant monotherapy in unipolar depression. The lack of randomization and absence of a non-response definition are design flaws. Controlled studies are required to confirm the findings of this trial.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Köhler S ; Unger T ; Hoffmann S ; Steinacher B ; Fydrich T ; Bschor T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1055/s-0032-1323677 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination/adverse effects\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nTreatment Failure\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Köhler S, Unger T, Hoffmann S, Steinacher B, Fydrich T, and Bschor T (2013) Comparing augmentation with non-antidepressants over sticking to antidepressants after treatment failure in depression: a naturalistic study..

Despite the high prevalence and the clinical and economic relevance of bipolar depression, few treatments are proven to be highly and consistently effective. In practice, the treatment of bipolar depression typically includes complex treatment decision-making. The best evidence for a pharmacological treatment exists for quetiapine. Alternatives with limitations are lamotrigine (also in the combination with lithium), carbamazepine and olanzapine. The effectiveness and recommendation of antidepressants in the treatment of bipolar depression remains controversial. Initially, depressive episodes should been treated with one of the named substances with antidepressant properties. In non-responders, a combination of lithium and lamotrigine, or antidepressants in combination with either lithium, an antiepileptic drug or atypical antipsychotics, may be necessary. If a depressive episode occurs under ongoing mood-stabilizing treatment, combination treatments of different substances, even with antidepressants, can be necessary. In the case of treatment-resistant depressive episodes, complex treatment strategies (combination therapies, MAO inhibitors) should be considered. This review describes the treatment recommendations of different guidelines for bipolar depression and emphasizes their differences. Furthermore, alternative pharmacological treatment strategies and complex treatment situations are discussed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Köhler S ; Gaus S ; Bschor T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1055/s-0033-1364004 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nClinical Trials as Topic/*methods/*standards\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Köhler S, Gaus S, and Bschor T (2014) The challenge of treatment in bipolar depression: evidence from clinical guidelines, treatment recommendations and complex treatment situations..

However, the comparative effectiveness and safety of these agents as add-on to lithium has not been studied. METHODS: This secondary analysis combined two similar 24-week trials on outpatients with bipolar disorder randomized to lithium (target serum level 0.4-0.6 mEq/L). Guideline-based adjunctive antipsychotics (Li+AP) and anticonvulsants (Li+AC) could be used if clinically indicated and was assessed at every study visit. Response was measured on the Clinical Global Impression scale and we performed adjusted mixed effects linear regression analyses. Analysis of variance tests compared metabolic measures including a binary diagnosis of metabolic syndrome before and after 24 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Among 379 outpatients (57% female, mean age 38 years, mean Clinical Global Impression 4.4), users of Li+AP (N = 50, primarily quetiapine and aripiprazole) improved to a similar degree (mean Clinical Global Impression improvement = 1.6, standard deviation = 1.5) as those using lithium-only (i.e. without adjunctive antipsychotics or anticonvulsants, N = 149, mean Clinical Global Impression improvement = 1.7, standard deviation = 1.4) (p = 0.59). Users of Li+AC (N = 107, primarily lamotrigine and valproate, mean Clinical Global Impression improvement = 1.2, standard deviation = 1.3) and users of Li+AP+AC (N = 73, mean Clinical Global Impression improvement = 1.1, standard deviation = 1.3) showed worse response compared to lithium-only users (all p < 0.01). When comparing Li+AP to Li+AC, users of Li+AP improved slightly better on general (p = 0.05) and manic symptoms (p = 0.01), but showed a worse development of glucose, triglycerides, and metabolic syndrome. CONCLUSION: Despite treatment-by-indication confounding, these findings are relevant for real-world treatment settings and emphasize the need for randomized trials on this clinically important topic.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Köhler-Forsberg O ; Sylvia LG ; Thase M ; Calabrese JR ; Tohen M ; Bowden CL ; McInnis M ; Iosifescu DV ; Kocsis JH ; Friedman ES ; Ketter TA ; McElroy SL ; Shelton RC ; Fung V ; Ostacher MJ ; Nierenberg AA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/00048674221077619 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\n*Anticonvulsants/adverse effects\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/chemically induced\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\n*Lithium/therapeutic use\r\n*Metabolic Syndrome/chemically induced/drug therapy\r\nValproic Acid/adverse effects\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nanticonvulsant\r\nantipsychotic\r\nbipolar depression\r\nlithium","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Köhler-Forsberg O, Sylvia LG, Thase M, Calabrese JR, Tohen M, Bowden CL, McInnis M, Iosifescu DV, Kocsis JH, Friedman ES, Ketter TA, McElroy SL, Shelton RC, Fung V, Ostacher MJ, and Nierenberg AA (2023) Lithium plus antipsychotics or anticonvulsants for bipolar disorder: Comparing clinical response and metabolic changes..

There is a lack of controlled studies evaluating therapies for treatment-resistant depression in late-life depression, and no randomized controlled studies assessing the efficacy and tolerability of lithium augmentation in elderly patients have been published. METHOD: Twenty-nine elderly inpatients with major depressive disorder according to DSM-IV criteria who had previously failed to respond to 1 or more adequate trials with a tricyclic antidepressant or venlafaxine were included in a 6-week, open, randomized, controlled study with a 2-year follow-up. Subjects received either lithium augmentation or the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine. The primary outcome criterion was remission, defined as a final score of less than or equal to 10 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Response was defined as at least 50% reduction on the MADRS or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). RESULTS: Twenty-eight subjects completed the trial. Remission on the MADRS was achieved by 33.3% of the lithium patients, compared with none of the phenelzine patients (p = .042). Response also showed a difference in favor of lithium augmentation (p = .035 on both the MADRS and the HAM-D). Overall tolerability was good, with no dropouts due to side effects. Subjective memory impairment was more prevalent among patients receiving phenelzine (p = .002), and tremors were significantly more prevalent among patients receiving lithium (p = .002). During the 2-year follow-up, 25 patients (86.2%) did achieve remission, particularly on prolonging the lithium treatment (5 patients) or on lithium augmentation to phenelzine (5 patients). CONCLUSION: Lithium was more effective than phenelzine in elderly patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, while tolerance of both treatments was remarkably good in this group of elderly inpatients with many comorbid medical disorders.

Thirty-two patients who did not achieve remission during the RCT, entered an open sequential treatment protocol and were treated with augmentation with lithium, switch to a monoamine oxidase inhibitor or ECT. RESULTS: Seventy-eight of the 81 patients (96.3%) achieved a response [> or = 50% reduction in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale score) and 68 patients (84%) a complete remission (final MADRS score < or = 10) within 3 years of treatment.

Managing bipolar depression can be a daunting task for clinicians. Most bipolar patients spend 80% of their time in the depressive phase of illness. In contrast with full-blown mania, patients and family frequently fail to recognize bipolar depression, which may interfere with early diagnosis and treatment. With only a few medications approved for bipolar depression, treatment becomes very challenging. There is evidence to support that schizoaffective depression has a worse outcome than psychotic depression and nonpsychotic depression. We report a patient with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type with severe depression who responded to an adequate level of lithium and subsequently, on a combination of lithium and quetiapine. Finally, we emphasize the importance of measurement-based care. To our knowledge, this is the first case report focusing on the management of depression in schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Koola MM ; Fawcett JA ; Kelly DL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/NMD.0b013e3182392d8f ","Keywords":"Biomarkers, Pharmacological/blood\r\nBipolar Disorder/blood/*diagnosis/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Management\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nPsychotic Disorders/blood/*diagnosis/*drug therapy\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Koola MM, Fawcett JA, and Kelly DL (2011) Case report on the management of depression in schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type focusing on lithium levels and measurement-based care..

Reports suggest that gestational iron deficiency can cause a deficit in behavioral, cognitive and affective functions and can precipitate depressive symptoms in mothers during the postpartum period. The present study examined the effect of iron supplementation on depressive behavior during postpartum period in a rat model. METHOD: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were crossed. Pregnant rats received iron, fluoxetine, desferrioxamine or vehicle throughout the period of gestation. During the postpartum period, mothers from all groups were taken through the open field test (OFT), forced swim test (FST), novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) and sacrificed for histological examination of the brains. RESULTS: Results showed that rats treated with iron-chelating agent, desferrioxamine, and vehicle during gestation exhibited increased immobility scores in the FST, increased latency to feed and reduced feeding in the NIH with corresponding decreased number of neurons and dendritic branches in the cortex of the brain. These depression-related effects were attenuated by perinatal iron supplementation which showed decreased immobility scores in the FST comparable to rats treated with fluoxetine, a clinically effective antidepressant. Iron treatment also decreased latency to feeding while increasing feeding behavior in the NIH. Iron-treated dams had a higher number of neurons with dendritic connections in the frontal cortex compared to vehicle- and desferrioxamine-treated groups. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that, iron supplementation during gestation exerts an antidepressant-like effect in postpartum Sprague-Dawley rats, attenuates neuronal loss associated with depression and increases dendritic spine density.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kukuia KKE ; Torbi J ; Amoateng P ; Adutwum-Ofosu KK ; Koomson AE ; Appiah F ; Tagoe TA ; Mensah JA ; Ameyaw EO ; Adi-Dako O ; Amponsah SK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ibneur.2022.04.004 ","Keywords":"AUC, area under the curve\r\nDFx, desferrioxamine\r\nDesferrioxamine\r\nFST, Forced swim test\r\nFe, iron\r\nFluoxetine\r\nFlx, fluoxetine\r\nGolgi staining\r\nHPA, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\r\nID, iron deficiency\r\nIron\r\nNIH, novelty-induced hypophagia\r\nOFT, open field test\r\nPPD, Post-partum depression\r\nPost-partum depression\r\nVEH, vehicle","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kukuia KKE, Torbi J, Amoateng P, Adutwum-Ofosu KK, Koomson AE, Appiah F, Tagoe TA, Mensah JA, Ameyaw EO, Adi-Dako O, and Amponsah SK (2022) Gestational iron supplementation reverses depressive-like behavior in post-partum Sprague Dawley rats: Evidence from behavioral and neurohistological studies..

METHODS: The depression facet of bipolar disorder was evaluated using forced swim test, tail suspension test, and chronic mild stress test. The models used to evaluate the mania facet of bipolar disorder were isolation-induced aggression test, saccharine preference test, and morphine-sensitized hyperlocomotion test. RESULTS: The immobility time was significantly (p<0.05) reduced by lamotrigine in the tail suspension test and the forced swim test, while lithium caused significant (p<0.05) reduction only in the tail suspension test. Rats exposed to chronic mild stress showed the maximal increment of 1% sucrose consumption at the 3rd week of treatment in both the lithium (p<0.001) and lamotrigine (p<0.01) groups. In the isolation-induced aggression test, the aggressive behaviour of rats was significantly reduced by both lithium [approach (p<0.001), attack (p<0.01), and bite (p<0.01)] and lamotrigine [approach (p<0.001), and attack (p<0.05)]. Neither of the drugs were effective in the saccharine preference test. Only lithium was able to significantly (p<0.05) reduce the crossing parameter in morphine-sensitized rats. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies the chronic mild stress test and isolation-induced aggression test of having the highest predictive validity in the depression and mania facets of bipolar disorder, respectively, and should be a part of a battery of tests used to evaluate novel mood stabilizers.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kumar M ; Tripathi CD ; Verma V ; Padhy BM ; Meshram GG ; Abhilash B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4306/pi.2016.13.4.434 ","Keywords":"Battery-based approach\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLithium\r\nPredictive validity","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kumar M, Tripathi CD, Verma V, Padhy BM, Meshram GG, and Abhilash B (2016) Predictive Validity of Some Common Animal Models of Bipolar Disorder Using Lithium and Lamotrigine Therapy: An Attempt towards a Battery-Based Approach for the Evaluation of Mood Stabilizers..

Pre-clinical studies suggest a potential role of zinc in reducing or preventing depressive symptoms. Many epidemiological studies have examined the association of low zinc status with depression; however, clinical trials on the effect of zinc supplementation in depression are limited. This review aimed to synthesise results from all published randomised controlled trials on the efficacy of zinc supplementation for reducing or preventing depressive symptoms. METHODS: Six databases were searched over all years of records until March 2011. All randomised controlled trials with a comparison group, that examined zinc supplementation as the intervention and depressive symptoms as the primary outcome were included. Pairs of reviewers extracted key information of study characteristics and outcomes, and assessed the quality of each study. RESULTS: Four randomised controlled trials met inclusion criteria. In studies that examined the effects of zinc supplementation as an adjunct to antidepressants drug treatment, zinc significantly lowered depressive symptom scores of depressed patients. There is less clear evidence on the effectiveness of zinc supplementation alone on depressive symptoms of non-depressed healthy subjects. The overall study quality was rated 'moderate'. LIMITATIONS: There are limited trials examining the effects of zinc supplementation on depressive symptoms. An overall pooled estimate of effect for all included studies could not be calculated and evidence was difficult to summarise because of substantial heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests potential benefits of zinc supplementation as a stand-alone intervention or as an adjunct to conventional antidepressant drug therapy for depression. However, there are methodological limitations in existing studies and so further well-designed, adequately powered research is required.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lai J ; Moxey A ; Nowak G ; Vashum K ; Bailey K ; McEvoy M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2011.06.022 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/*prevention & control\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nYoung Adult\r\nZinc/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lai J, Moxey A, Nowak G, Vashum K, Bailey K, and McEvoy M (2012) The efficacy of zinc supplementation in depression: systematic review of randomised controlled trials..

With the rising cost of prescription medications and their production of unwanted side effects, patients are exploring herbal and other natural remedies for the management and treatment of psychological conditions. Psychological disorders are one of the most frequent conditions seen by clinicians, and often require a long-term regimen of prescription medications. Approximately 6.8 million Americans suffer from generalized anxiety disorder. Many also suffer from the spectrum of behavioural and physical side effects that often accompany its treatment. It is not surprising that there is universal interest in finding effective natural anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) treatments with a lower risk of adverse effects or withdrawal. METHODS: An electronic and manual search was performed through MEDLINE/PubMed and EBSCO. Articles were not discriminated by date of publication. Available clinical studies published in English that used human participants and examined the anxiolytic potential of dietary and herbal supplements were included. Data were extracted and compiled into tables that included the study design, sample population, intervention, control, length of treatment, outcomes, direction of evidence, and reported adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 24 studies that investigated five different CAM monotherapies and eight different combination treatments and involved 2619 participants met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. There were 21 randomized controlled trials and three open-label, uncontrolled observational studies. Most studies involved patients who had been diagnosed with either an anxiety disorder or depression (n = 1786). However, eight studies used healthy volunteers (n = 877) who had normal levels of anxiety, were undergoing surgery, tested at the upper limit of the normal range of a trait anxiety scale, had adverse premenstrual symptoms or were peri-menopausal, reported anxiety and insomnia, or had one month or more of elevated generalized anxiety. Heterogeneity and the small number of studies for each supplement or combination therapy prevented a formal meta-analysis. Of the randomized controlled trials reviewed, 71% (15 out of 21) showed a positive direction of evidence. Any reported side effects were mild to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available evidence, it appears that nutritional and herbal supplementation is an effective method for treating anxiety and anxiety-related conditions without the risk of serious side effects. There is the possibility that any positive effects seen could be due to a placebo effect, which may have a significant psychological impact on participants with mental disorders. However, based on this systematic review, strong evidence exists for the use of herbal supplements containing extracts of passionflower or kava and combinations of L-lysine and L-arginine as treatments for anxiety symptoms and disorders. Magnesium-containing supplements and other herbal combinations may hold promise, but more research is needed before these products can be recommended to patients. St. John's wort monotherapy has insufficient evidence for use as an effective anxiolytic treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lakhan SE ; Vieira KF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1475-2891-9-42 ","Keywords":"Anti-Anxiety Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety/*drug therapy\r\nAnxiety Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nArginine/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nHypericum\r\nKava\r\nLysine/therapeutic use\r\nMagnesium/therapeutic use\r\nPassiflora\r\n*Phytotherapy\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nVitamin B 6/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lakhan SE, and Vieira KF (2010) Nutritional and herbal supplements for anxiety and anxiety-related disorders: systematic review..

Lithium has been suggested to effectively prevent relapse, yet data remain limited and inconclusive. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of continuation treatment with lithium in preventing relapse following a successful acute course of ECT in patients with major depression, in comparison to continuation treatment without lithium. We also assessed the role of several study characteristics, possibly impacting the treatment effect. METHODS: A systematic literature search, using the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases (up to June 2020), was conducted for prospective and retrospective studies, including patients with unipolar or bipolar depression, that assessed the efficacy of lithium for post-ECT depressive relapse prevention. RESULTS: Of 2556 records screened, 14 articles reporting on 9748 participants who received continuation treatment either with (N = 1571) or without lithium (N = 8177) were included in the meta-analysis. Patients receiving lithium were less likely to experience depressive relapse after a successful acute course of ECT, compared to patients receiving post-ECT prophylaxis without lithium (weighted odds ratio (OR) = 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.34, 0.82), with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 7 (95% CI = 4, 21). We found some limited evidence that older patients may benefit more from continuation treatment with lithium, compared to younger patients. Using the GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence for our outcome measure (i.e., relapse rate) was rated as very low. CONCLUSION: Continuation treatment with lithium may have superior efficacy in reducing the risk of relapse after a successful acute ECT course for major depression, in comparison to continuation treatment without lithium. High-quality studies are needed to confirm this finding.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lambrichts S ; Detraux J ; Vansteelandt K ; Nordenskjöld A ; Obbels J ; Schrijvers D ; Sienaert P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/acps.13277 ","Keywords":"Depression\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\n*Electroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nProspective Studies\r\nRecurrence\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\ncontinuation treatment\r\ndepressive disorder\r\nelectroconvulsive therapy\r\nlithium\r\nrelapse","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lambrichts S, Detraux J, Vansteelandt K, Nordenskjöld A, Obbels J, Schrijvers D, and Sienaert P (2021) Does lithium prevent relapse following successful electroconvulsive therapy for major depression?

A comprehensive review of the literature was hereafter conducted. RESULTS: Sertraline and citalopram are first-line treatment among selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor for depression. It is recommended to use lithium for bipolar disorders if an overall assessment finds an indication for mood-stabilizing treatment during pregnancy. Lamotrigine can be used. Valproate and carbamazepin are contraindicated. Olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine and clozapine can be used for bipolar disorders and schizophrenia.

However, the association between adults with IDA and psychiatric disorders has not been clarified. The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychiatric disorder morbidity of an IDA group in comparison with a non-IDA group and to examine the risk of psychiatric disorders in IDA patients treated with iron supplementation. METHODS: All study subjects were 20 years of age or over with newly diagnosed IDA enrolled in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database from 2000 to 2012. We matched IDA and non-IDA subjects according to age and gender in a 1:2 ratio. Our primary outcome was diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and the patients were monitored until the end of 2013. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to explore the risk of psychiatric disorders in patients with IDA after adjustment for confounders, including demographic characteristics and comorbidities. RESULTS: The adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of psychiatric disorders was 1.52 (95% CI = 1.45-1.59) in the IDA group compared with the non-IDA group. Among the different types of psychiatric disorders, the IDA group was associated with significantly higher incidence and risks of anxiety disorders, depression, sleep disorders, and psychotic disorders (p < 0.05). Furthermore, iron supplementation in IDA subjects was associated with a significantly lower risk of psychiatric disorders compared to non-iron supplementation in IDA patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that IDA subjects had an increased risk of psychiatric disorders, regardless of other confounders. In IDA patients, iron supplementation was associated with a decreased risk of psychiatric disorders. Moreover, IDA patients receiving iron supplementation also had a lower risk of sleep disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lee HS ; Chao HH ; Huang WT ; Chen SC ; Yang HY ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12888-020-02621-0 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\nIron\r\n*Mental Disorders/complications/epidemiology\r\nTaiwan/epidemiology\r\nYoung Adult\r\nGender difference\r\nIron deficiency anemia\r\nIron supplementation\r\nPsychiatric disorders","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lee HS, Chao HH, Huang WT, Chen SC, and Yang HY (2020) Psychiatric disorders risk in patients with iron deficiency anemia and association with iron supplementation medications: a nationwide database analysis..

However, any clinically relevant site of action of lithium must occur at therapeutic concentrations attained in the brain of patients and must account for the lag period accompanying onset of action as well as effects persisting beyond discontinuation of treatment. This monovalent cation acts as a potent uncompetitive inhibitor in the receptor-coupled breakdown of inositol phospholipids, resulting in a relative depletion of inositol and an alteration in the generation of diacylglycerol, an endogenous activator of protein kinase C. In our laboratory, we are examining the action of chronically administered lithium on posttranslational modification of specific phosphoproteins involved in regulating signal transduction in the brain. We have found that chronic, but not acute, administration of lithium in rats markedly reduces a major phosphoprotein substrate of protein kinase C in the hippocampus, an effect that persists beyond the cessation of lithium treatment. This protein, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (\"MARCKS\"), is implicated in synaptic neurotransmission, calcium regulation, and cytoskeletal restructuring. These findings have relevance for the long-term action of lithium in stabilizing an underlying dysregulation in the brain and may move us closer to formulating a molecular basis of manic depressive illness.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lenox RH ; Watson DG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/*physiopathology\r\nBrain/drug effects/*physiopathology\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*pharmacology\r\nPhosphatidylinositols/metabolism\r\nProtein Kinase C/metabolism\r\nSignal Transduction/drug effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lenox RH, and Watson DG (1994) Lithium and the brain: a psychopharmacological strategy to a molecular basis for manic depressive illness..

In this paper we critically examine the accumulated preclinical and clinical evidence for the action of lithium in the brain and suggest areas that may be most productive for future investigation, i.e., membrane transport systems, neurotransmitter receptor regulation, second messenger generating systems, protein kinase C (PKC) regulation, and gene expression. In their experimental design, preclinical investigations have often jeopardized the physiologic relevance of their studies by a relative lack of attention to issues such as therapeutic concentrations, acute versus chronic exposure, and a lack of adequate cation and/or psychotropic controls. Future studies should account for the established prophylactic efficacy of lithium, the higher risk for relapse into mania after abrupt discontinuation, the ability of lithium to stabilize recurrent depression associated with unipolar disorder, and the efficacy of lithium in the treatment of refractory major depressive disorder in the presence of an antidepressant. Studies of the action of lithium in receptor mediated phosphoinositide signaling in the brain over the past several years have opened up heuristic lines of investigation that stem from lithium's uncompetitive inhibition of the enzyme inositol monophosphatase. Subsequent studies involving regulation of inositol transport, PKC isozymes and activity, and the expression of the major PKC substrate MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate) have offered potential avenues for understanding the complexity of the action of long-term lithium in the brain. These studies will offer us a better understanding of the neuroanatomical sites of action of lithium and together with ongoing clinical investigations using brain imaging in patients with manic-depressive illness a more complete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lenox RH ; McNamara RK ; Papke RL ; Manji HK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/metabolism/prevention & control\r\nBrain/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nBrain Chemistry/drug effects\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy/metabolism/prevention & control\r\nGTP-Binding Proteins/drug effects/metabolism\r\nGene Expression/drug effects\r\nGenes, Immediate-Early/drug effects\r\nGenes, fos/drug effects\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nNeuropeptides/drug effects/metabolism\r\nNeurotransmitter Agents/metabolism\r\nSignal Transduction/drug effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lenox RH, McNamara RK, Papke RL, and Manji HK (1998) Neurobiology of lithium: an update..

METHODS: We conducted a two-step, open-label trial involving adults 60 years of age or older with treatment-resistant depression. In step 1, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to augmentation of existing antidepressant medication with aripiprazole, augmentation with bupropion, or a switch from existing antidepressant medication to bupropion. Patients who did not benefit from or were ineligible for step 1 were randomly assigned in step 2 in a 1:1 ratio to augmentation with lithium or a switch to nortriptyline. Each step lasted approximately 10 weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in psychological well-being, assessed with the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Positive Affect and General Life Satisfaction subscales (population mean, 50; higher scores indicate greater well-being). A secondary outcome was remission of depression. RESULTS: In step 1, a total of 619 patients were enrolled; 211 were assigned to aripiprazole augmentation, 206 to bupropion augmentation, and 202 to a switch to bupropion. Well-being scores improved by 4.83 points, 4.33 points, and 2.04 points, respectively. The difference between the aripiprazole-augmentation group and the switch-to-bupropion group was 2.79 points (95% CI, 0.56 to 5.02; P = 0.014, with a prespecified threshold P value of 0.017); the between-group differences were not significant for aripiprazole augmentation versus bupropion augmentation or for bupropion augmentation versus a switch to bupropion. Remission occurred in 28.9% of patients in the aripiprazole-augmentation group, 28.2% in the bupropion-augmentation group, and 19.3% in the switch-to-bupropion group. The rate of falls was highest with bupropion augmentation. In step 2, a total of 248 patients were enrolled; 127 were assigned to lithium augmentation and 121 to a switch to nortriptyline. Well-being scores improved by 3.17 points and 2.18 points, respectively (difference, 0.99; 95% CI, -1.92 to 3.91). Remission occurred in 18.9% of patients in the lithium-augmentation group and 21.5% in the switch-to-nortriptyline group; rates of falling were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In older adults with treatment-resistant depression, augmentation of existing antidepressants with aripiprazole improved well-being significantly more over 10 weeks than a switch to bupropion and was associated with a numerically higher incidence of remission. Among patients in whom augmentation or a switch to bupropion failed, changes in well-being and the occurrence of remission with lithium augmentation or a switch to nortriptyline were similar.

Thus, the prophylaxis of both unipolar depression and bipolar disorder in this patient subpopulation is an important task of psychiatrists and other physicians. Although lithium remains an effective prophylactic and treatment agent in younger individuals with bipolar disorder, its prophylactic efficacy and tolerability has not been thoroughly investigated among middle aged and older people with unipolar depression and bipolar disorder. Our study is based on a mirror-image design that compared the clinical course with lithium treatment and the clinical course prior to lithium treatment based on a retrospective chart review. We examined the results obtained with long-term lithium maintenance in a group of 60 middle-aged and older adult patients (age >60 years) with unipolar depression and bipolar disorder. More specifically, we analyzed changes of frequency, severity, and duration of depressive or manic relapses, rate and duration of hospitalizations and suicidal behavior (thoughts or attempts), and various assessments of outcome. A significant reduction was found on all indices during lithium therapy compared to before lithium treatment, attesting to the prophylactic efficacy of long-term lithium in unipolar depression and bipolar disorder. The range of side effects in our sample was similar to that found in other reports in this age group. The probability of relapse and recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder and with unipolar depression can be significantly decreased by lithium prophylaxis. Further investigation is mandated to confirm these findings under double-blind conditions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lepkifker E ; Iancu I ; Horesh N ; Strous RD ; Kotler M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/da.20273 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nSuicide, Attempted","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lepkifker E, Iancu I, Horesh N, Strous RD, and Kotler M (2007) Lithium therapy for unipolar and bipolar depression among the middle-aged and older adult patient subpopulation..

Micronutrient supplements are recommended for pregnant women because of their documented protective effects for the offspring, but their potential beneficial effects on maternal mental health are unknown. This study investigated the association between prenatal micronutrient supplementation and the risk for symptoms of postpartum depression in a longitudinal pregnancy cohort from the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) study. METHODS: Participants came from a cohort of the first 600 APrON women. Supplemental nutrient intake and symptoms of depression (measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)) were collected at each trimester and 12 weeks postpartum. RESULTS: Of the 475 participants who completed the EPDS at least twice in pregnancy and at 12 weeks postpartum, 416 (88%) scored <10 and 59 (12%) scored ≥10, where an EPDS ≥10 is considered to be \"at least probable minor depression\". Mean nutrient intakes from supplements were higher in women with lower EPDS scores, particularly selenium (p = 0.0015) and omega-3s (p = 0.01). Bivariate analyses showed that several demographic and social/lifestyle variables were associated with EPDS ≥10: not having been born in Canada (p = 0.01), greater number of chronic conditions (p = 0.05), greater number of stressful life events during this pregnancy (p = 0.02), and lower prenatal and postnatal support (p = 0.0043 and p = 0.0001, respectively). Adjusting for covariates and nutrients known to be associated with postpartum depression, logistic regression showed that having a prenatal EPDS ≥ 10 increased the odds of postpartum depressive symptoms (second and third trimester OR = 3.29, 95% CI = 1.55 - 7.01, p = 0.004 and OR = 4.26, 95% CI = 2.05 - 8.85, p < 0.0001, respectively), while prenatal supplemental selenium (per 10 mcg, OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.74 - 0.78, p = 0.0019) and postnatal social support (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.78 - 0.97, p = 0.0015) were protective. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors, including supplementary selenium intake, are associated with the risk of postpartum depressive symptoms. Future research on dietary supplementation in pregnancy with special attention to selenium intake is warranted.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Leung BM ; Kaplan BJ ; Field CJ ; Tough S ; Eliasziw M ; Gomez MF ; McCargar LJ ; Gagnon L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1471-2393-13-2 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nCohort Studies\r\nDepression, Postpartum/*etiology/psychology\r\nDietary Supplements/*statistics & numerical data\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLogistic Models\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nMicronutrients/*administration & dosage\r\nPregnancy\r\n*Prenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nRisk\r\nSelenium/administration & dosage\r\nSocial Support\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Leung BM, Kaplan BJ, Field CJ, Tough S, Eliasziw M, Gomez MF, McCargar LJ, and Gagnon L (2013) Prenatal micronutrient supplementation and postpartum depressive symptoms in a pregnancy cohort..

Zinc promotes antioxidant effects, neurogenesis, and immune system responses. From neonatal brain development to the preservation and control of adult brain function, zinc is a vital homeostatic component of the CNS. Molecularly, zinc regulates gene expression with transcription factors and activates dozens of enzymes involved in neuronal metabolism. During development and in adulthood, zinc acts as a regulator of synaptic activity and neuronal plasticity at the cellular level. There are several neurological diseases that may be affected by changes in zinc status, and these include stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, traumatic brain injuries, and depression. Accordingly, zinc deficiency may result in declines in cognition and learning and an increase in oxidative stress, while zinc accumulation may lead to neurotoxicity and neuronal cell death. In this review, we explore the mechanisms of brain zinc balance, the role of zinc in neurological diseases, and strategies affecting zinc for the prevention and treatment of these diseases.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Li Z ; Liu Y ; Wei R ; Yong VW ; Xue M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/biom13010028 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\n*Zinc/metabolism\r\nCentral Nervous System/metabolism\r\nBrain/metabolism\r\nMetals/metabolism\r\n*Neurodegenerative Diseases/metabolism\r\nbrain\r\nbrain injury\r\nneurotoxicity\r\nstroke\r\nzinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Li Z, Liu Y, Wei R, Yong VW, and Xue M (2022) The Important Role of Zinc in Neurological Diseases..

Anxiety and depression are the most common psychiatric comorbidities of MS, which seriously affect patients' quality of life, treatment compliance, and prognosis. However, current treatments for anxiety and depression in MS show low therapeutic efficacy and significant side effects. In the present study, we explored the therapeutic effects of a novel low-toxic anti-inflammatory drug, nanoparticulate magnesium hydride (MgH(2)), on mood disorders of MS. We observed that anxiety/depression-like behaviors in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice were alleviated by MgH(2) treatment. In addition, disease severity and inflammatory demyelination were also diminished. Furthermore, we confirmed the suppressive effect of MgH(2) on depression in the acute restraint stress model. Mechanistically, MgH(2) may play a therapeutic role by promoting microglial M2 polarization, inhibiting microglial M1 polarization, and reducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. Therefore, nanoparticulate MgH(2) may be a promising therapeutic drug for psychiatric comorbidities of MS.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Li Z ; Chen K ; Shao Q ; Lu H ; Zhang X ; Pu Y ; Sun X ; He H ; Cao L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12974-023-02696-y ","Keywords":"Mice\r\nAnimals\r\n*Multiple Sclerosis/complications/drug therapy\r\nMicroglia/physiology\r\nDepression/drug therapy/etiology\r\nQuality of Life\r\n*Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/drug therapy\r\nOxidative Stress\r\nAnxiety/drug therapy/etiology\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nAnxiety\r\nDepression\r\nEAE\r\nMgH2\r\nMicroglial polarization\r\nMultiple sclerosis\r\nNeuroinflammation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Li Z, Chen K, Shao Q, Lu H, Zhang X, Pu Y, Sun X, He H, and Cao L (2023) Nanoparticulate MgH(2) ameliorates anxiety/depression-like behaviors in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis by regulating microglial polarization and oxidative stress..

Here, we directly compared lamotrigine to lithium under conditions similar to clinical routine conditions. METHODS: Adult bipolar I disorder patients with at least two episodes within the last five years and an index episode requiring treatment were randomized to lithium (n = 78; doses adjusted to obtain serum levels of 0.5-1.0 mmol/L) or to lamotrigine (n = 77; up-titrated to 400 mg/day) as maintenance treatments. Randomization took place when clinically appropriate, and comedication was allowed within the first six months after randomization. The patients were enrolled from March 2001 to December 2005, and observations were censored December 2006, allowing a subgroup of patients to be followed for more than five years. The primary outcome measure was time to predefined endpoints indicating insufficient maintenance treatment, and the major secondary outcome measure was time to any study endpoint. Data were analyzed primarily by Cox proportional regression models. RESULTS: For the primary outcome measure, the crude Hazard Rate Ratio (HRR) (lamotrigine relative to lithium) was 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60-1.40]. When the primary endpoints were broken down by polarity, the HRRs (lamotrigine relative to lithium) for mania and depression were, respectively, 1.91 (95% CI: 0.73-5.04) and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.41-1.22). There was no between-group difference in terms of staying in study [HRR: 0.85 (95% CI: 0.61-1.19)]. Most treatment failures occurred within the first 1.5 years of treatment, and, among patients followed for at least five years, practically no patients were maintained successfully on monotherapy with either of the drugs. The lithium-treated patients reported diarrhea, tremor, polyuria, and thirst more frequently. Two cases, probably lamotrigine-related, of benign rash occurred. CONCLUSIONS: No differences in maintenance effectiveness between lithium and lamotrigine could be demonstrated.

In recent years the evidence base on lithium for bipolar disorder has substantially increased due to results from a number of trials. Therefore, a review of this evidence is timely. The efficacy of lithium as an acute treatment and as a maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder was evaluated through a review of the evidence, focusing on modern, randomized, parallel-group designed trials. Additionally, the evidence was sought translated into the proper use of lithium in clinical practice. Lithium's antimanic efficacy has been convincingly demonstrated. However, as blood monitoring due to the risk of toxicity is required and due to an insufficient response in highly agitated patients, lithium monotherapy has a limited place in the acute treatment of severe manic states. For acute bipolar depression, results are conflicting. Recent maintenance trials have added substantially to the documentation of lithium's long-term stabilizing properties in bipolar disorder, and these properties have been demonstrated independently of any acute response to lithium. Finally, it is now beyond doubt that not only does lithium prevent mania, but also depression in bipolar disorder. Lithium is still to be considered a major if not the most important mood- stabilizer, at least for maintaining long-term stability in patients with bipolar disorder. The potential risks of lithium should be weighed up against its benefits and the fact that serious adverse effects are usually avoidable.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Licht RW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1755-5949.2011.00260.x ","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDisease Management\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*administration & dosage\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic/methods","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Licht RW (2012) Lithium: still a major option in the management of bipolar disorder..

Current research on lithium, divalproex, and lamotrigine provides new insight into the effective management of this illness. Advances in identifying the mechanism of action of mood stabilization has focused on signaling pathways within the cell that are associated with neurotrophic effects. Clinical research has led to confirmatory evidence of the efficacy of lithium in all phases of bipolar disorder, with the greatest effects seen in the treatment and prevention of mania. Compared to divalproex, lithium also has been found to have greater efficacy in the prevention of suicide. Lamotrigine has emerged as a first line treatment for bipolar depression, which is an area of weakness for other mood stabilizers. Oral loading of divalproex leads to rapid stabilization of mania without imposing a greater adverse effect burden than conventional dosing.

Although putative mood stabilisers, such as lithium, are considered to improve the natural course of bipolar disorder, complete long-term remission is rarely achieved. In order to effectively control mood symptoms and to reduce relapse, clinicians often use polypharmacy to treat patients with bipolar disorder. In this article, we examine the recent literature on treatment strategies in bipolar disorder to determine if combination treatments provide additional benefit over monotherapy for the management of various phases of bipolar disorder. The evidence suggests that for acute mania a combination of lithium or valproate and an atypical antipsychotic is the most effective approach, with approximately 20% more patients responding to the combination than to monotherapy with any antimanic agent. Few studies have examined the use of combination therapy in comparison to monotherapy for bipolar depression. The limited evidence suggests that lithium plus an antidepressant appears to be more effective than lithium alone in those with lower serum lithium concentrations. Similarly, the combination of olanzapine plus fluoxetine is more effective than olanzapine alone. There is consensus that antidepressant monotherapy is not appropriate because of concerns of a manic switch, but monotherapy with lithium or lamotrigine may be adequate for mild to moderate bipolar depression. For maintenance treatment, commonly used agents, such as lithium, valproate or olanzapine appear to be most effective in preventing manic relapses, whereas lamotrigine is more effective in preventing depressive relapses. As a result of these findings, it makes intuitive sense to combine lamotrigine with lithium, valproate or an atypical antipsychotic to achieve better mood stability. However, the efficacy and safety of such combinations have not been systematically compared with monotherapy. Preliminary studies suggest that lithium plus valproate may be more effective than lithium alone in preventing affective relapses. Similarly, the combination of lithium or valproate plus olanzapine seems to be more effective than monotherapy with a mood stabiliser in preventing manic episodes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lin D ; Mok H ; Yatham LN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2165/00023210-200620010-00003 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/classification/*drug therapy\r\n*Drug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nPractice Guidelines as Topic\r\nSecondary Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lin D, Mok H, and Yatham LN (2006) Polytherapy in bipolar disorder..

Here, we demonstrated that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons that project to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but not to nucleus accumbens (NAc), contributed to the antidepressive-like effects of lithium. Projection-specific electrophysiological recordings revealed that high concentrations of lithium increased firing rates in mPFC-, but not NAc-, projecting VTA DA neurons in mice treated with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CMS). In parallel, chronic administration of high-dose lithium in CMS mice restored the firing properties of mPFC-projecting DA neurons, and also rescued CMS-induced depressive-like behaviors. Nevertheless, chronic lithium treatment was insufficient to change the basal firing rates in NAc-projecting VTA DA neurons. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of mPFC-, but not NAc-, projecting VTA DA neurons mimicked the antidepressive-like effects of lithium in CMS mice. Chemogenetic downregulation of VTA-mPFC DA neurons' firing activity abolished the antidepressive-like effects of lithium in CMS mice. Finally, we found that the antidepressant-like effects induced by high-dose lithium were mediated by BNDF signaling in the mesocortical DA circuit. Together, these results demonstrated the role of mesocortical DA projection in antidepressive-like effects of lithium and established a circuit foundation for lithium-based antidepressive treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Liu D ; Tang QQ ; Wang D ; Song SP ; Yang XN ; Hu SW ; Wang ZY ; Xu Z ; Liu H ; Yang JX ; Montgomery SE ; Zhang H ; Han MH ; Ding HL ; Cao JL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41386-020-0713-0 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology\r\n*Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major\r\nLithium\r\nMice\r\nNucleus Accumbens/metabolism\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/metabolism\r\nVentral Tegmental Area/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Liu D, Tang QQ, Wang D, Song SP, Yang XN, Hu SW, Wang ZY, Xu Z, Liu H, Yang JX, Montgomery SE, Zhang H, Han MH, Ding HL, and Cao JL (2020) Mesocortical BDNF signaling mediates antidepressive-like effects of lithium..

It is also unclear whether aetiology, course of illness and treatment should differ in patients with a first manifestation in older age and patients suffering from a recurrence of a BD known for decades. This narrative review will summarize the current state of knowledge about the epidemiology, clinical features, and treatment of BD in the elderly. METHODS: We conducted a Medline literature search from 1970 to 2021 using MeSH terms \"Bipolar Disorder\" × \"Aged\" or \"Geriatric\" or \"Elderly\". Search results were complemented by additional literature retrieved from examining cross references and by hand search in text books. Varying cut-off ages have been applied to differentiate old age from adult age BD. Within old age BD, there is a reasonable agreement of distinct entities, early and late-onset BD. They differ to some extent in clinical symptoms, course of illness, and some co-morbidities. Point prevalence of BD in older adults appears slightly lower than in working-age adults, with polarity of episodes shifting towards depression. Psychopharmacological treatment needs to take into account the special aspects of somatic gerontology and the age-related change of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics. The evidence for commonly used treatments such as lithium, mood-stabilizing antiepileptics, antipsychotics, and antidepressants remains sparse. Preliminary results support a role of ECT as well as psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions in old age BD. CONCLUSIONS: There is an obvious need of further research for all treatment modalities of BD in old age. The focus should be pharmacological and psychosocial approaches, as well as their combination, and the role of physical treatment modalities such as ECT.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ljubic N ; Ueberberg B ; Grunze H ; Assion HJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12991-021-00367-x ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants\r\nAntidepressants\r\nAntipsychotics\r\nBipolar depression\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nLithium\r\nMania\r\nMixed state\r\nOld age\r\nOlder adults","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ljubic N, Ueberberg B, Grunze H, and Assion HJ (2021) Treatment of bipolar disorders in older adults: a review..

Although the only comparison available is with other geographical regions, it appears that lithium use has remained relatively constant in recent years (53% in this sample). The use of anticonvulsants (62%) was greater than in previous studies, as was use of mood stabilizers in combination (37% overall, 53% in rapid cycling subjects). Antidepressant use was found in 23% of subjects. Eleven percent of subjects taking antidepressants were not prescribed a mood stabilizer and 43% of antidepressants prescribed were tricyclics, possibly increasing the risk of switching to mania. Fifteen percent had no mood stabilizer and antipsychotic use was almost equally split between typical and atypical drugs. Practice in the population studied is nearer than treatment described in previous work to that suggested in the literature. This may result from either, or most probably a combination of, the local availability of a specialist mood disorder service and evolution of overall prescribing practice. However, it still falls short in a number of respects of such recommendations as exist and this requires further examination and monitoring.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lloyd AJ ; Harrison CL ; Ferrier IN ; Young AH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0269881103017002013 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\n*Drug Utilization Review\r\nFemale\r\nHospitals\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nOutpatients\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lloyd AJ, Harrison CL, Ferrier IN, and Young AH (2003) The pharmacological treatment of bipolar affective disorder: practice is improving but could still be better..

The authors investigated the efficacy of lurasidone, a novel antipsychotic agent, as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate for the treatment of bipolar I depression. METHOD Patients were randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of double-blind adjunctive treatment with lurasidone (N=183) or placebo (N=165), added to therapeutic levels of either lithium or valproate. Primary and key secondary endpoints were change from baseline to week 6 on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and depression severity score on the Clinical Global Impressions scale for use in bipolar illness (CGI-BP), respectively. RESULTS Lurasidone treatment significantly reduced mean MADRS total score at week 6 compared with the placebo group (-17.1 versus -13.5; effect size=0.34). Similarly, lurasidone treatment resulted in significantly greater endpoint reduction in CGI-BP depression severity scores compared with placebo (-1.96 versus -1.51; effect size=0.36) as well as significantly greater improvement in anxiety symptoms and in patient-reported measures of quality of life and functional impairment. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 6.0% and 7.9% in the lurasidone and placebo groups, respectively. Adverse events most frequently reported for lurasidone were nausea, somnolence, tremor, akathisia, and insomnia. Minimal changes in weight, lipids, and measures of glycemic control were observed during treatment with lurasidone. CONCLUSIONS In patients with bipolar I depression, treatment with lurasidone adjunctive to lithium or valproate significantly improved depressive symptoms and was generally well tolerated.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Loebel A ; Cucchiaro J ; Silva R ; Kroger H ; Sarma K ; Xu J ; Calabrese JR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13070985 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIsoindoles/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use\r\nLurasidone Hydrochloride\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nThiazoles/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nValproic Acid/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Loebel A, Cucchiaro J, Silva R, Kroger H, Sarma K, Xu J, and Calabrese JR (2014) Lurasidone as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate for the treatment of bipolar I depression: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study..

Few studies have examined the relationship between diet and bipolar disorder (BD), although it can be assumed that some of the observations related to people with depression may be related to BD. The authors present an overview of the relationship between diet and bipolar disorder and the use of dietary interventions in the treatment of BD. They also discuss the use of nutrients, including polyunsaturated fatty acids, N-acetylcysteine, vitamin D, folic acid, and zinc, in the treatment of BD. For patients, the supplementation of mood disorders treatment with dietary recommendations, supplementation with selected nutrients, supplementation of micronutrients, may provide - in addition to indirect and direct effect on brain function - the possibility of greater co-participation in the treatment, enhancing the sense of control, coping, which may have a significant effect on the course of BD and the effectiveness of its treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Łojko D ; Stelmach-Mardas M ; Suwalska A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.12740/PP/OnlineFirst/78703 ","Keywords":"*Antioxidants\r\nBipolar Disorder/prevention & control/*therapy\r\n*Diet\r\nHumans\r\nMicronutrients\r\n*Nutritional Requirements\r\nTrace Elements\r\n*Vitamins\r\nbipolar affective disorder\r\ndiet","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Łojko D, Stelmach-Mardas M, and Suwalska A (2018) Is diet important in bipolar disorder?.

Searches included MEDLINE complete, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), psychINFO, psychARTICLES, pubMED, ProQuest Health and Medical Complete Academic Search complete, Scopus and ScienceDirect. Ten randomized controlled trials and one non-randomized controlled trial were found to meet the inclusion criteria. Seven studies found improvements in aspects of mood and cognition after iron supplementation. Iron supplementation appeared to improve memory and intellectual ability in participants aged between 12 and 55 years in seven studies, regardless of whether the participant was initially iron insufficient or iron-deficient with anaemia. The review also found three controlled studies providing evidence to suggest a role for zinc supplementation as a treatment for depressive symptoms, as both an adjunct to traditional antidepressant therapy for individuals with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder and as a therapy in its own right in pre-menopausal women with zinc deficiency. Overall, the current literature indicates a positive effect of improving zinc status on enhanced cognitive and emotional functioning. However, further study involving well-designed randomized controlled trials is needed to identify the impact of improving iron and zinc status on mood and cognition.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lomagno KA ; Hu F ; Riddell LJ ; Booth AO ; Szymlek-Gay EA ; Nowson CA ; Byrne LK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu6115117 ","Keywords":"Affect/*drug effects\r\nAnemia, Iron-Deficiency/blood/complications/drug therapy\r\nCognition/*drug effects\r\nDepression/blood/etiology/prevention & control\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIron, Dietary/administration & dosage/*blood\r\nPremenopause\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nZinc/administration & dosage/*blood/deficiency","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lomagno KA, Hu F, Riddell LJ, Booth AO, Szymlek-Gay EA, Nowson CA, and Byrne LK (2014) Increasing iron and zinc in pre-menopausal women and its effects on mood and cognition: a systematic review..

Rapid cycling status did not affect frequency of depressive relapse or sustained treatment response. Rapid cyclers were more likely to experience hypomanic symptoms (P = 0.005) during continuation monotherapy; however, rates were similar in venlafaxine (17.6%) and lithium (42.9%) (P = 0.31).

There are few studies that have examined whether quality of life improves following pharmacological treatments of bipolar depression. In this exploratory study, we examined the effects of antidepressant versus mood stabilizer monotherapy on quality of life ratings in bipolar II subjects during acute (12 week) treatment. Data were derived from a randomized double-blind comparison of venlafaxine (n = 65) versus lithium (n = 64) monotherapy. The Quality of Life Index (QLI) was administered at baseline (n = 126; 98%) and again at the end of treatment. We explored treatment differences in continuous changes on the QLI using last-observation carried forward. Additionally, we explored the likelihood of experiencing clinically-significant improvements as well as baseline correlates of QLI and changes in QLIe. Venlafaxine was superior to lithium in reducing symptoms of depression during acute treatment. However, there were no significant differences between treatments in QLI ratings. Changes in symptoms of depression were correlated to, but not redundant, with improvements in QLI ratings. These findings suggest that quality of life may be an important secondary outcome to target and measure as a part of comparative clinical trials of pharmacotherapy for bipolar II depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lorenzo-Luaces L ; Amsterdam JD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.psychres.2017.11.025 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nQuality of Life/*psychology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVenlafaxine Hydrochloride/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressant\r\nBipolar II depression\r\nBipolar II disorder\r\nLithium\r\nQuality of life\r\nRandomized controlled clinical trial\r\nVenlafaxine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lorenzo-Luaces L, and Amsterdam JD (2018) Effects of venlafaxine versus lithium monotherapy on quality of life in bipolar II major depressive disorder: Findings from a double-blind randomized controlled trial..

However, the clinical response to lithium is heterogeneous, and the molecular basis for this difference in response is unknown. In the present study, we sought to determine how the peripheral blood gene expression profiles of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) changed over time following intitiation of treatment with lithium, and whether differences in those profiles over time were related to the clinical response. METHODS: Illumina Sentrix Beadchip (Human-6v2) microarrays containing > 48,000 transcript probes were used to measure levels of expression of gene-expression in peripheral blood from 20 depressed subjects with BD prior to and every two weeks during 8 weeks of open-label treatment with lithium.Changes in gene-expression were compared between treatment responders (defined as a decrease in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale of 50% or more) and non-responders. Pathway analysis was conducted using GeneGO Metacore software. RESULTS: 127 genes showed a differential response in responders vs. non-responders. Pathway analysis showed that regulation of apoptosis was the most significantly affected pathway among these genes. Closer examination of the time-course of changes among BCL2 related genes showed that in lithium-responders, one month after starting treatment with lithium, several anti-apoptotic genes including Bcl2 and insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) were up-regulated, while pro-apoptotic genes, including BCL2-antagonist/killer 1 (BAK1) and BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD), were down-regulated. In contrast, in lithium non-responders, BCL2 and IRS2 were down-regulated, while BAK1 and BAD up-regulated at the one-month time-point. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that differential changes in the balance of pro- and anti- apoptotic gene-expression following treatment with lithium may explain some of the heterogeneity in clinical response in BD patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lowthert L ; Leffert J ; Lin A ; Umlauf S ; Maloney K ; Muralidharan A ; Lorberg B ; Mane S ; Zhao H ; Sinha R ; Bhagwagar Z ; Beech R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/2045-5380-2-15 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lowthert L, Leffert J, Lin A, Umlauf S, Maloney K, Muralidharan A, Lorberg B, Mane S, Zhao H, Sinha R, Bhagwagar Z, and Beech R (2012) Increased ratio of anti-apoptotic to pro-apoptotic Bcl2 gene-family members in lithium-responders one month after treatment initiation..

However, challenges remain in the power of penetration and precision of magnetic stimulation, especially in small animals. Here, a novel combined magnetic stimulation system (c-MSS) was established for brain stimulation in mice. The c-MSS uses a mild magnetic pulse sequence and injection of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanodrugs to elevate local cortical susceptibility. After imaging of the SPIO nanoparticles in the left prelimbic (PrL) cortex in mice, we determined their safety and physical characteristics. Depressive-like behavior was established in mice using a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model. SPIO nanodrugs were then delivered precisely to the left PrL cortex using in situ injection. A 0.1 T magnetic field (adjustable frequency) was used for magnetic stimulation (5 min/session, two sessions daily). Biomarkers representing therapeutic effects were measured before and after c-MSS intervention. Results showed that c-MSS rapidly improved depressive-like symptoms in CUMS mice after stimulation with a 10 Hz field for 5 d, combined with increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and inactivation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, which enhanced neuronal activity due to SPIO nanoparticle-mediated effects. The c-MSS was safe and effective, representing a novel approach in the selective stimulation of arbitrary cortical targets in small animals, playing a bioelectric role in neural circuit regulation, including antidepressant effects in CUMS mice. This expands the potential applications of magnetic stimulation and progresses brain research towards clinical application.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lu QB ; Sun JF ; Yang QY ; Cai WW ; Xia MQ ; Wu FF ; Gu N ; Zhang ZJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2020.076 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nDepression/*therapy\r\nGyrus Cinguli/*physiology\r\nMagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage\r\nMagnetic Phenomena\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nBioelectronics\r\nDepression\r\nMagnetic stimulation\r\nSPIO nanoparticles","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lu QB, Sun JF, Yang QY, Cai WW, Xia MQ, Wu FF, Gu N, and Zhang ZJ (2020) Magnetic brain stimulation using iron oxide nanoparticle-mediated selective treatment of the left prelimbic cortex as a novel strategy to rapidly improve depressive-like symptoms in mice..

Due to significant challenges in defining treatment-related phenotypes, our understanding of their genetic bases is limited. This study aimed to derive a stringent definition of treatment resistance and to investigate genetic overlap between treatment response and resistance in MDD. Using electronic medical records on the use of antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) from Swedish registers, we derived the phenotype of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) within ~ 4 500 individuals with MDD in three Swedish cohorts. Considering antidepressants and lithium are first-line treatment and augmentation used for MDD, respectively, we generated polygenic risk scores of antidepressant and lithium response for individuals with MDD, and evaluated their associations with treatment resistance by comparing TRD with non-TRD. Among 1 778 ECT-treated MDD cases, nearly all (94%) used antidepressants before first ECT, and the vast majority had at least one (84%) or two (61%) antidepressants of adequate duration, suggesting these MDD cases receiving ECT were resistant to antidepressants. We found that TRD cases tend to have lower genetic load of antidepressant response than non-TRD, although the difference was not significant; furthermore, TRD cases had significantly higher genetic load of lithium response (OR = 1.10-1.12 under different definitions). The results support evidence of heritable components in treatment-related phenotypes and highlight the overall genetic profile of lithium-sensitivity in TRD. This finding further provides a genetic explanation for lithium efficacy in treating TRD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lu Y ; Xiong Y ; Karlsson R ; Song J ; Kowalec K ; Rück C ; Sigstrom R ; Jonsson L ; Clements C ; Andersson E ; Boberg J ; Lewis C ; Sullivan P ; Landén M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.21203/rs.3.rs-2556941/v1 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lu Y, Xiong Y, Karlsson R, Song J, Kowalec K, Rück C, Sigstrom R, Jonsson L, Clements C, Andersson E, Boberg J, Lewis C, Sullivan P, and Landén M (2023) Investigating genetic overlap between antidepressant and lithium response and treatment resistance in major depressive disorder..

Current guidelines recommend the use of lithium as a treatment for acute bipolar depression; however, the therapeutic range for the treatment has not been fully defined. Recently, the adjunctive lower lithium dose in bipolar depression has revealed potential efficacy; however, no study has investigated it predominantly in monotherapy. In this open-label, proof-of-concept study, 31 individuals with bipolar disorder during a depressive episode were randomized and 29 were followed up for six weeks with flexible lithium dosing. All subjects had a 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) score of ≥18 at baseline. Subjects were divided into two groups, with higher (Li ≥0.5 mEq/l) or lower (Li <0.5 mEq/l) blood lithium levels. Response and remission rates were evaluated using the HAM-D scores. Following 6 weeks of lithium treatment, the remission rate for all patients was 62.0%. The plasma lithium levels did not impact the clinical response. However, subjects with higher blood lithium levels had an increased prevalence of nausea, restlessness, headaches and cognitive complaints. The results indicate that the lithium dose for the treatment of bipolar depression in an individual should be based on the clinical efficacy and side-effects. In the context of personalized psychiatric treatments, it is necessary to evaluate the therapeutic action of lithium with individual regimens in order to develop more tolerable and effective treatment approaches.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Machado-Vieira R ; Zanetti MV ; DE Sousa RT ; Soeiro-DE-Souza MG ; Moreno RA ; Busatto GF ; Gattaz WF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3892/etm.2014.1864 ","Keywords":"bipolar disorder\r\ndepression\r\nlithium\r\ntreatment\r\ntrial","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Machado-Vieira R, Zanetti MV, DE Sousa RT, Soeiro-DE-Souza MG, Moreno RA, Busatto GF, and Gattaz WF (2014) Lithium efficacy in bipolar depression with flexible dosing: A six-week, open-label, proof-of-concept study..

As a small ion, lithium is omnipresent, and consequently, its molecular mechanisms and targets are widespread. Currently, lithium is a crucial pharmacotherapy for the treatment of acute mood episodes, prophylactic therapy, and suicide prevention in BD. Besides, lithium blood level is the most widely used biomarker in clinical psychiatry. The concept of stress in BD characterizes short- and long-term deleterious effects at multiple levels (from genes to behaviors) and the ability to establish homeostatic regulatory mechanisms to either prevent or reverse these effects. Within this concept, lithium has consistently shown anti-stress effects, by normalizing components across several levels associated with BD-induced impairments in cellular resilience and plasticity. METHODS: A literature search for biomarkers associated with lithium effects at multiple targets, with a particular focus on those related to clinical outcomes was performed. An extensive search of the published literature using PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar was performed. Example search terms included lithium, plasticity, stress, efficacy, and neuroimaging. Articles determined by the author to focus on lithium's impact on neural plasticity markers (central and periphery) and clinical outcomes were examined in greater depth. Relevant papers were evaluated, selected and included in this review. RESULTS: Lithium induces neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects in a wide range of preclinical and translational models. Lithium's neurotrophic effects are related to the enhancement of cellular proliferation, differentiation, growth, and regeneration, whereas its neuroprotective effects limit the progression of neuronal atrophy or cell death following the onset of BD. Lithium's neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects seem most pronounced in the presence of pathology, which again supports its pivotal role as an active homeostatic regulator. LIMITATIONS: Few studies associated with clinical outcomes. Due to space limitations, the author was unable to detail all findings, in special those originated from preclinical studies. CONCLUSIONS: These results support a potential role for biomarkers involved in neuroprotection and activation of plasticity pathways in lithium's clinical response. Evidence supporting this model comes from results evaluating macroscopic and microscopic brain structure as well neurochemical findings in vivo from cellular to sub-synaptic (molecules and intracellular signaling) compartments using central and peripheral biomarkers. Challenges to precisely decipher lithium's biological mechanisms involved in its therapeutic profile include the complex nature of the illness and clinical subtypes, family history and comorbid conditions. In the context of personalized medicine, it is necessary to validate predictive biomarkers of response to lithium by designing longitudinal clinical studies during mood episodes and associated clinical dimensions in BD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Machado-Vieira R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2017.12.026 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nBrain/pathology\r\nHomeostasis\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use\r\nNeuronal Plasticity/*drug effects/physiology\r\nNeurons/metabolism\r\nSignal Transduction/drug effects\r\nStress, Psychological/*physiopathology\r\nBiology\r\nBiomarkers\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nDepression\r\nLithium plasticity\r\nTreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Machado-Vieira R (2018) Lithium, Stress, and Resilience in Bipolar Disorder: Deciphering this key homeostatic synaptic plasticity regulator..

However, despite the key pertinence of this phase of the condition, the focus of research and indeed of clinical interest in the management of bipolar disorder has been mainly on mania. Bipolar depression has been largely neglected, and early studies often failed to distinguish depression due to major unipolar depression from that due to bipolar disorder. Consequently, many treatments used in the management of major depression have been adopted for use in bipolar depression without any robust evidence of efficacy. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), bupropion, tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors are all effective antidepressants in the management of bipolar depression. They are all associated with a small risk of antidepressant-induced mood instability. The mood stabilisers lithium, carbamazepine and valproate semisodium (divalproex sodium) all appear to have modest acute antidepressant properties. Among these, lithium is supported by the strongest data, but the use of lithium in the treatment of bipolar depression as a monotherapeutic agent is limited by its slow onset of action. Recently, there has been a growing body of evidence suggesting that lamotrigine may have particular effectiveness in both the acute and prophylactic management of bipolar depression. Clinical management of bipolar depression involves various combinations of antidepressants and mood stabilisers and is partly determined by the context in which the depressive episode occurs. In general, 'de novo' and 'breakthrough' (where the patient is already receiving medication) bipolar depression may be successfully managed by initiating mood stabiliser monotherapy, to which an antidepressant or second mood stabiliser may be added at a later date, if necessary. Breakthrough episodes of bipolar depression occurring in patients receiving combination therapy (two mood stabilisers or a mood stabiliser plus an antidepressant) require either switching of ongoing medications or further augmentation. If this fails, then novel strategies or ECT should be considered. Bipolar depression is a disabling illness and the predominant mood state for the vast majority of those with bipolar disorder. It therefore warrants prompt management once suitably diagnosed, especially as it is associated with a considerable risk of suicide and in the majority of instances is eminently treatable.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Malhi GS ; Mitchell PB ; Salim S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2165/00023210-200317010-00002 ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/classification/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/classification/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/classification/diagnosis/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nPsychotherapy\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Malhi GS, Mitchell PB, and Salim S (2003) Bipolar depression: management options..

The purpose of this paper is to briefly review the evidence base for the pharmacotherapy of bipolar depression and to discuss the recommendations for its optimal management. METHODS: A detailed literature review was undertaken with a particular emphasis on pharmacological treatment strategies for bipolar depression across the acute and maintenance phases of the illness. Electronic library and Web-based searches were performed using recognised tools (MEDLINE, PubMED, EMBASE and PsychINFO) to identify the pertinent literature. A summary of the evidence base is outlined and then distilled into broad clinical recommendations to guide the pharmacological management of bipolar depression. RESULTS: Partitioning treatment into acute and maintenance therapy is difficult based on the paucity of current evidence. The evidence from treatment trials favours the use of lithium and lamotrigine as first-line treatment in preference to valproate, and indicates that, for acute episodes, quetiapine and olanzapine have perhaps achieved equivalence at least in terms of efficacy. However, the effectiveness of the atypical antipsychotics in maintenance therapy is constrained by the potential for significant side effects of individual agents and the lack of both long-term research data and clinical experience in treating bipolar disorder as compared to other agents. Conversely, lithium and the anticonvulsants are generally slower to effect symptomatic change, and this limits their usefulness. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a tendency for research trials of bipolar depression to differentiate the illness cross-sectionally into the acute and maintenance phases of bipolar depression; however, in clinical terms, bipolar depression invariably follows a longitudinal course in which the phases of illness are inextricably linked, and useful acute treatments are typically continued in maintenance. Therefore, when medicating mood in acute bipolar depression it is imperative to keep maintenance in mind as it is this aspect of treatment that determines long-term success.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Malhi GS ; Adams D ; Berk M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1399-5618.2009.00711.x ","Keywords":"Affect/*drug effects\r\nAntimanic Agents/economics/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/economics/*therapy\r\nClinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data\r\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy/methods\r\nCost of Illness\r\nDatabases, Bibliographic/statistics & numerical data\r\n*Guidelines as Topic\r\nHormone Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Malhi GS, Adams D, and Berk M (2009) Medicating mood with maintenance in mind: bipolar depression pharmacotherapy..

The purpose of the present paper was to succinctly review the therapeutic profile of lithium particularly with respect to the treatment of mood disorders and consider its unique properties and clinical utility. A comprehensive literature review pertaining to lithium was undertaken using electronic database search engines to identify relevant clinical trials, meta-analyses and Cochrane reviews. In addition articles and book chapters known to the authors were carefully reviewed, and the authors appraised published guidelines. The evidence from these sources was rated using National Health and Medical Research Council evidence levels and synthesized according to phenotype and mood states. In addition, the authors have drawn upon published guidelines and their own clinical experience. Lithium has specificity for mood disorders with proven efficacy in the treatment of both unipolar depression and bipolar disorder. The recommendations are based predominantly on Level I evidence, but its clinical use has to be tempered against potential side-effects and the need for ongoing monitoring. In practice, lithium should be considered a first-line option in bipolar disorder, especially in prophylaxis and when onset of action is not an imperative. Lithium has been in use in modern medicine for 60 years and as such has been tried and tested across the full range of mood disorders. Arguably, lithium is the only true mood stabilizer and because of its unique properties is in a class of its own.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Malhi GS ; Adams D ; Berk M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3109/00048670903279937 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nSuicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Malhi GS, Adams D, and Berk M (2009) Is lithium in a class of its own?

It confers considerable functional disability to the individual, their family and society as a whole and yet it is often undetected, misdiagnosed and treated poorly. In the past decade, many new treatment strategies have been trialled in the management of bipolar disorder with variable success. The emerging evidence, for pharmacological agents in particular, is promising but when considered alone does not directly translate to real-world clinical populations of bipolar disorder. Data from drug trials are largely based on findings that identify differences between groups determined in a time-limited manner, whereas clinical management concerns the treatment of individuals over the life-long course of the illness. Considering the findings in the context of the individual and their particular needs perhaps best bridges the gap between the evidence from research studies and their application in clinical practice. Specifically, only lithium and valproate have moderate or strong evidence for use across all three phases of bipolar disorder. Anticonvulsants, such as lamotrigine, have strong evidence in maintenance; whereas antipsychotics largely have strong evidence in acute mania, with the exception of quetiapine, which has strong evidence in bipolar depression. Maintenance data for antipsychotics is emerging but at present remains weak. Combinations have strong evidence in acute phases of illness but maintenance data is urgently needed. Conventional antidepressants only have weak evidence in bipolar depression and do not have a role in maintenance therapy. Therefore, this paper summarizes the efficacy data for treating bipolar disorder and also applies clinical considerations to these data when formulating recommendations for the management of bipolar disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Malhi GS ; Adams D ; Cahill CM ; Dodd S ; Berk M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2165/11318850-000000000-00000 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/economics/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/economics/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/economics/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/economics\r\nDibenzothiazepines/economics/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/economics/therapeutic use\r\nPractice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data\r\nQuetiapine Fumarate","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Malhi GS, Adams D, Cahill CM, Dodd S, and Berk M (2009) The management of individuals with bipolar disorder: a review of the evidence and its integration into clinical practice..

Lithium has been used for about 60 years as a 'mood stabilizer' for bipolar disorder with proven efficacy in preventing relapse of both mania and depression. Despite its long history and ongoing use in current management of bipolar disorder, the optimal dosing of lithium is still the subject of ongoing debate. This article aims to evaluate different dosing schedules, in the light of the unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of lithium, as well as its adverse-effect and toxicity profiles. This is all the more important given the narrow therapeutic index of lithium. Current recommendations mostly advocate that lithium be administered in multiple daily doses. However, single daily or alternate daily schedules may be viable options for administration. Multiple daily schedules are thought to be advantageous in maintaining more constant plasma lithium concentrations than single daily regimens, which are associated with significant fluctuations throughout the day. When comparing these two schedules with respect to plasma lithium concentrations, adverse-effect profiles and recurrence of symptoms, there are no significant differences between the two regimens. In fact, a single daily regimen may have added advantages in reducing the risk of long-term renal damage and increasing compliance. The evidence for alternate daily dosing is somewhat varied with regard to symptom recurrence; however, this schedule has been shown to be associated with decreased adverse effects, and further research into this issue is therefore warranted. Presently, therefore, clinicians should consider single daily administration of lithium to potentially minimize adverse effects and enhance compliance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Malhi GS ; Tanious M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2165/11586970-000000000-00000 ","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse \r\n      effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*administration & dosage/adverse \r\n      effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use\r\nLithium Compounds/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Malhi GS, and Tanious M (2011) Optimal frequency of lithium administration in the treatment of bipolar disorder: clinical and dosing considerations..

In part, this is because of exaggerated fears surrounding lithium toxicity, acute and long-term tolerability and the encumbrance of life-long plasma monitoring. Recent research has once again positioned lithium centre stage and amplified the importance of understanding its science and how this translates to clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to provide a sound knowledge base as regards the science and practice of lithium therapy. METHOD: A comprehensive literature search using electronic databases was conducted along with a detailed review of articles known to the authors pertaining to the use of lithium. Studies were limited to English publications and those dealing with the management of psychiatric disorders in humans. The literature was synthesized and organized according to relevance to clinical practice and understanding. RESULTS: Lithium has simple pharmacokinetics that require regular dosing and monitoring. Its mechanisms of action are complex and its effects are multi-faceted, extending beyond mood stability to neuroprotective and anti-suicidal properties. Its use in bipolar disorder is under-appreciated, particularly as it has the best evidence for prophylaxis, qualifying it perhaps as the only true mood stabilizer currently available. In practice, its risks and tolerability are exaggerated and can be readily minimized with knowledge of its clinical profile and judicious application. CONCLUSION: Lithium is a safe and effective agent that should, whenever indicated, be used first-line for the treatment of bipolar disorder. A better understanding of its science alongside strategic management of its plasma levels will ensure both wider utility and improved outcomes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Malhi GS ; Tanious M ; Das P ; Berk M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0004867412437346 ","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse \r\n      effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse \r\n      effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nMedication Adherence/psychology\r\nModels, Biological\r\nSynaptic Transmission/drug effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Malhi GS, Tanious M, Das P, and Berk M (2012) The science and practice of lithium therapy..

Despite this, the specific mechanisms by which lithium exerts its mood-stabilizing effects are not well understood. Given the inherently complex nature of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder, this paper aims to capture what is known about the actions of lithium ranging from macroscopic changes in mood, cognition and brain structure, to its effects at the microscopic level on neurotransmission and intracellular and molecular pathways. A comprehensive literature search of databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO was conducted using relevant keywords and the findings from the literature were then reviewed and synthesized. Numerous studies report that lithium is effective in the treatment of acute mania and for the long-term maintenance of mood and prophylaxis; in comparison, evidence for its efficacy in depression is modest. However, lithium possesses unique anti-suicidal properties that set it apart from other agents. With respect to cognition, studies suggest that lithium may reduce cognitive decline in patients; however, these findings require further investigation using both neuropsychological and functional neuroimaging probes. Interestingly, lithium appears to preserve or increase the volume of brain structures involved in emotional regulation such as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, possibly reflecting its neuroprotective effects. At a neuronal level, lithium reduces excitatory (dopamine and glutamate) but increases inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmission; however, these broad effects are underpinned by complex neurotransmitter systems that strive to achieve homeostasis by way of compensatory changes. For example, at an intracellular and molecular level, lithium targets second-messenger systems that further modulate neurotransmission. For instance, the effects of lithium on the adenyl cyclase and phospho-inositide pathways, as well as protein kinase C, may serve to dampen excessive excitatory neurotransmission. In addition to these many putative mechanisms, it has also been proposed that the neuroprotective effects of lithium are key to its therapeutic actions. In this regard, lithium has been shown to reduce the oxidative stress that occurs with multiple episodes of mania and depression. Further, it increases protective proteins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and B-cell lymphoma 2, and reduces apoptotic processes through inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 and autophagy. Overall, it is clear that the processes which underpin the therapeutic actions of lithium are sophisticated and most likely inter-related.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Malhi GS ; Tanious M ; Das P ; Coulston CM ; Berk M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s40263-013-0039-0 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nSignal Transduction/drug effects\r\nSynaptic Transmission/drug effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Malhi GS, Tanious M, Das P, Coulston CM, and Berk M (2013) Potential mechanisms of action of lithium in bipolar disorder.

It appears to have been well received, as evidenced by its increasing popularity amongst doctors as a deskside clinical aide, and adoption and reproduction of the schematic in clinical guidelines and texts. However, since its publication 5 years ago, key basic neuroscience and clinical research developments pertaining to lithium have significantly advanced our understanding, necessitating further refinement of guidance concerning the practicalities of lithium therapy. METHODS: Literature concerning the indications for, and therapeutic levels of, lithium and the associated acute and chronic risks of therapy was scrutinized as part of updating clinical practice guidelines. We have reviewed these updates and identified significant areas of change with respect to the previous Lithiumeter (version 1.0). RESULTS: Since 2011, updated clinical practice guidelines have narrowed the indicated plasma lithium concentration for maintenance therapy, suggesting that additional guidance is necessary for optimizing treatment. Relevant updated clinical guidance was integrated to constitute the Lithiumeter 2.0, which provides a more comprehensive overview of the practical aspects of lithium therapy while maintaining a focus on optimization of lithium levels, such as differential titration of lithium depending on the current mood state. CONCLUSIONS: The Lithiumeter 2.0 is an update that clinicians will find useful for their practice. By addressing some of the issues faced in clinical practice, translational clinical research will continue to inform the Lithiumeter in future updates.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Malhi GS ; Gershon S ; Outhred T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/bdi.12455 ","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nDiagnostic Equipment\r\n*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/diagnosis/etiology/prevention & \r\n      control\r\nHumans\r\n*Lithium/analysis/therapeutic use\r\nbipolar depression\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nclinical practice\r\nlithium\r\nmania","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Malhi GS, Gershon S, and Outhred T (2016) Lithiumeter: Version 2.0..

Its administration is complex and often requires sophisticated management and assiduous monitoring. When considering the use of lithium therapy for bipolar disorder, clinicians are advised to refer to recommendations outlined in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs); but because of varying emphases placed by different international CPGs, recommendations addressing the practical use of lithium lack consistency. METHOD: In order to inform clinicians of optimal lithium therapy for bipolar disorder, we compared and synthesized recommendations for the treatment of bipolar disorder made by recognized CPGs internationally. We conducted a search of the literature and extracted guidance across multiple clinical issues, including clinical indications, disorder subtypes, additional uses, special populations, practical aspects, and side effects. RESULTS: Collectively, CPGs consider lithium most robustly as a first-line intervention for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder and strongly for the treatment of mania, with relatively modest support for the management of acute bipolar depression. Additionally, there is consensus across the CPGs that lithium tangibly reduces the risk of suicide. Generally, CPGs provide guidance on the many facets of initiating and maintaining patients on lithium therapy, but individually the CPGs varied in terms of depth and practical guidance they provide across these areas. However, consensus was established across many key areas of practice such as the ideal lithium plasma concentration for maintenance and monitoring (0.6-0.8mmol/L), along with the need for regular monitoring of renal and endocrine function. However, with more complex aspects (e.g., atypical presentations) and in special populations (e.g., youth; pregnancy and post-partum; older adults), guidance varied considerably and clear consensus recommendations were more difficult to achieve. In younger adults desirable plasma lithium levels of 0.6-0.8mmol/L can perhaps be achieved with comparatively lower doses and in the very elderly it may be prudent to target lower plasma levels in the first instance. These are important practical points for consideration that, along with many others offered throughout the article, should assist clinicians in dissecting the more complex aspects of management with greater precision. LIMITATIONS: This review was limited to CPGs written in English. CPGs are themselves limited by reliance on evidence that often has little resemblance to real-world presentations. An important area that is not sufficiently addressed in the CPGs is clear guidance on the cessation of lithium therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed on many aspects of lithium therapy and this alongside existing knowledge needs to be used more consistently to inform CPGs, which should also incorporate empirical evidence and clinical experience. The recommendations in this paper provide a useful synthesis of guidance available currently.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Malhi GS ; Gessler D ; Outhred T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2017.03.052 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nConsensus\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\n*Practice Guidelines as Topic\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nClinical guidance\r\nDepression\r\nLithium\r\nMania\r\nRecommendations","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Malhi GS, Gessler D, and Outhred T (2017) The use of lithium for the treatment of bipolar disorder: Recommendations from clinical practice guidelines..

This guideline summary, directed broadly at primary care physicians, is an abridged version that focuses on bipolar disorder. It is intended as an aid to the management of this complex disorder for primary care physicians working in collaboration with psychiatrists to implement successful long term management. Main recommendations: The guidelines address the main phases of bipolar disorder with a particular emphasis on long term management, and provide specific clinical recommendations. Mania: All physicians should be able to detect its early signs so that treatment can be initiated promptly. At the outset, taper and cease medications with mood-elevating properties and institute measures to reduce stimulation, and transfer the patient to specialist care. Bipolar depression: Treatment is complicated and may require trialling treatment combinations. Monotherapy with mood-stabilising agents or second generation antipsychotics has demonstrated efficacy but using combinations of these agents along with antidepressants is sometimes necessary to achieve remission. Commencing adjunctive structured psychosocial treatments in this phase is benign and likely effective. Long term management: Physicians should adjust treatment to prevent the recurrence of manic and/or depressive symptoms and optimise functional recovery. Closely monitor the efficacy of pharmacological and psychological treatments, adverse effects and compliance. Changes in management as a result of the guidelines: The guidelines position bipolar disorder as part of a spectrum of mood disorders and provide a longitudinal perspective for assessment and treatment. They provide new management algorithms for the maintenance phase of treatment that underscore the importance of ongoing monitoring to achieve prophylaxis. As a first line treatment, lithium remains the most effective medication for the prevention of relapse and potential suicide, but requires nuanced management from both general practitioners and specialists. The guidelines provide clarity and simplicity for the long term management of bipolar disorder, incorporating the use of new medications and therapies alongside established treatments.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Malhi GS ; Outhred T ; Morris G ; Boyce PM ; Bryant R ; Fitzgerald PB ; Hopwood MJ ; Lyndon B ; Mulder R ; Murray G ; Porter RJ ; Singh AB ; Fritz K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.5694/mja17.00658 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAustralia\r\nBipolar Disorder/*diagnosis/*therapy\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nMood Disorders/*diagnosis/*therapy\r\nNew Zealand\r\nSecondary Prevention/methods\r\nSocieties, Medical\r\nSuicide Prevention\r\nDepressive disorders\r\nGuidelines as topic\r\nMood disorders","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Malhi GS, Outhred T, Morris G, Boyce PM, Bryant R, Fitzgerald PB, Hopwood MJ, Lyndon B, Mulder R, Murray G, Porter RJ, Singh AB, and Fritz K (2018) Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists clinical practice guidelines for mood disorders: bipolar disorder summary..

The extent to which other mood stabilizers (e.g., carbamazepine and valproate) have antidepressant activity is unclear. Preliminary initial research suggests three potential advantages that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have over tricyclic antidepressant for ABD: possibly greater efficacy, fewer adverse effects, and a lower frequency of antidepressant-induced mania. Bupropion may also have significant advantages. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are the antidepressant of choice for atypical bipolar depression. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has the highest response rate of all treatments for ABD.

A single antidepressant trial is often insufficient for patients to achieve remission. Remission rates for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are about 30% to 35%. Using successive treatment steps with optimal medication dosing and making measurement-based treatment decisions can help patients achieve remission, but, at each step, remission is less likely than at the first step. Depression is considered treatment-resistant if 2 adequate trials of medication fail. Clinicians can use validated symptom checklists such as the 16-Item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire, Global Assessment of Functioning, and Sheehan Disability Scale to identify patients with treatment-resistant depression. Treatment resistance is likely in patients with a history of depressive chronicity and concurrent psychiatric and medical disorders and may be mistakenly suspected in patients who have had an inadequate trial of medication or who have been misdiagnosed. Strategies that can be effective to combat treatment resistance include optimizing treatment, switching to another antidepressant, combining antidepressants, and augmenting antidepressants with nonantidepressant treatments such as buspirone, lithium, liothyronine, atypical antipsychotics, or other agents. In addition, clinicians need to cultivate strong therapeutic alliances with patients, use objective measurements, practice evidence-based medicine, and educate patients about the disease and its treatments.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Manning JS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.9104su1c.02 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy/methods\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/*therapy\r\n*Drug Resistance\r\nDrug Therapy/methods\r\nHumans\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nRemission Induction/*methods\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use\r\nSeverity of Illness Index","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Manning JS (2010) What alternatives to first-line therapy for depression are effective?.

Therefore, this study was aimed at investigating the influence of zinc on depressive-like behavior induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), on alterations in glutamate-induced toxicity and immunocontent of proteins involved in the control of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus of mice. Mice were subjected to CUS procedure for 14 days. From the 8th to the 14th day, mice received zinc chloride (ZnCl2) (10 mg/kg) or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, positive control) once a day by oral route. CUS caused a depressive-like behavior evidenced by the increased immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST), which was prevented by treatment with ZnCl2 or fluoxetine. Ex vivo exposure of hippocampal slices to glutamate (10 mM) resulted in a significant decrease on cell viability; however, neither CUS procedure nor drug treatments altered this reduction. No alterations in the immunocontents of GLT-1 and GFAP or p-Akt were observed in any experimental group. The ratio of p-Akt/AKT was also not altered in any group. However, Akt immunocontent was increased in stressed mice and in animals treated with ZnCl2 (stressed or non-stressed mice) and EAAC1 immunocontent was increased in stressed mice treated with ZnCl2, fluoxetine or vehicle and in non-stressed mice treated with ZnCl2 and fluoxetine. These findings indicate a robust effect of zinc in reversing behavioral alteration induced by CUS in mice, through a possible modulation of the glutamatergic neurotransmission, extending literature data regarding the mechanisms underlying its antidepressant-like action.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Manosso LM ; Moretti M ; Colla AR ; Ribeiro CM ; Dal-Cim T ; Tasca CI ; Rodrigues AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00702-015-1504-3 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBlotting, Western\r\nChlorides/*pharmacology\r\n*Depression\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFemale\r\nFluoxetine/pharmacology\r\nGlutamine/metabolism\r\nHippocampus/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nMice\r\nStress, Psychological/psychology\r\nSynaptic Transmission/*drug effects\r\nZinc Compounds/*pharmacology\r\nAntidepressant\r\nGlutamate\r\nStress\r\nTail suspension test\r\nZinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Manosso LM, Moretti M, Colla AR, Ribeiro CM, Dal-Cim T, Tasca CI, and Rodrigues AL (2016) Involvement of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the antidepressant-like effect of zinc in the chronic unpredictable stress model of depression..

METHODS: Mice were treated with sub-effective or effective doses of zinc chloride (ZnCl(2), 10mg/kg, po), and 45min later, they received intracerebroventricular (icv) injections of sub-effective doses of either zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP, 10μg/mouse, HO-1 inhibitor), cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP, 0.01μg/mouse, HO-1 inducer) or K-252a (1μg/mouse, TrkB receptor antagonist). Immobility time and locomotor activity were evaluated through the tail suspension test (TST) and open-field test (OFT), respectively. HO-1 immunocontents were evaluated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus 60min after ZnCl(2) (10mg/kg, po) treatment. RESULTS: The antidepressant-like effect of ZnCl(2) was prevented by the treatment with ZnPP and K-252a. Furthermore, sub-effective doses of CoPP and ZnCl(2) produced a synergistic antidepressant-like effect in the TST. None of the treatments altered locomotor activity. ZnCl(2) administration increased HO-1 immunocontents only in the prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the antidepressant-like effect of ZnCl(2) in the TST may depend on the induction of HO-1, and activation of TrkB receptor.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Manosso LM ; Moretti M ; Rosa JM ; Cunha MP ; Rodrigues ALS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pharep.2017.01.010 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nCarbazoles/pharmacology\r\nChlorides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nFemale\r\nHeme Oxygenase-1/*metabolism\r\nHindlimb Suspension\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nIndole Alkaloids/pharmacology\r\nInjections, Intraventricular\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/drug effects/metabolism\r\nProtoporphyrins/pharmacology\r\nZinc Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nAntidepressant\r\nBrain-derived neurotrophic factor\r\nHeme oxygenase-1\r\nTail suspension test\r\nZinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Manosso LM, Moretti M, Rosa JM, Cunha MP, and Rodrigues ALS (2017) Evidence for the involvement of heme oxygenase-1 in the antidepressant-like effect of zinc..

BACKGROUND: Approximately one third of patients treated with antidepressants exhibit suboptimal or delayed clinical response to these medications. In such cases, alternative options include switching to another antidepressant or adding a second antidepressant. Augmentation strategies include addition of lithium carbonate, atypical antipsychotics, psychostimulants, thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine), pindolol, or buspirone. CONCLUSIONS: In approximately half of all antidepressant-resistant cases of major depressive disorder, controlled clinical trials have indicated that augmentation with lithium or thyroid hormone is effective. Other reports suggest that central nervous system stimulants may augment antidepressant activity, but their use is constrained by possible abuse potential. Pindolol therapy has been shown to accelerate clinical response in some but not all studies. Finally, the favorable safety and tolerability profile of buspirone, together with its desirable anxiolytic effects, render it a sound therapeutic option in antidepressant augmentation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Marangell LB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0149-2918(00)80071-5 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nControlled Clinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nThyroid Hormones/administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Marangell LB (2000) Augmentation of standard depression therapy..

METHODS: Patients with a current manic/mixed episode received Li or Val for at least 2 weeks. Those with an inadequate response [Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score ≥ 16 and ≤ 35% decrease from baseline at 2 weeks] received adjunctive single-blind ARI plus mood stabilizer. Patients who achieved stability [YMRS and Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score ≤ 12] for 12 consecutive weeks were randomized to double-blind ARI (10-30 mg/day) or PLB+Li / Val. Relapse was monitored for 52 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 337 patients were randomized to ARI+ Li / Val (n=168) or PLB+Li / Val (n=169). The Kaplan-Meier relapse rate at 52 weeks was 17% with ARI+Li / Val and 29% with PLB+Li / Val. ARI+Li / Val significantly delayed time to any relapse compared with PLB+Li / Val; hazard ratio=0.54 (95% confidence interval: 0.33-0.89; log-rank p=0.014).

CONCLUSIONS: Continuation of ARI+Li / Val treatment increased the time to relapse to any mood episode compared with Li or Val monotherapy, and was relatively well tolerated during the one-year study. These findings suggest that there is a long-term benefit in continuing ARI adjunctive to a mood stabilizer after sustained remission is achieved.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Marcus R ; Khan A ; Rollin L ; Morris B ; Timko K ; Carson W ; Sanchez R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1399-5618.2011.00898.x ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAripiprazole\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nConfidence Intervals\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination/methods\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPiperazines/*therapeutic use\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nQuinolones/*therapeutic use\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nValproic Acid/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Marcus R, Khan A, Rollin L, Morris B, Timko K, Carson W, and Sanchez R (2011) Efficacy of aripiprazole adjunctive to lithium or valproate in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar I disorder with an inadequate response to lithium or valproate monotherapy: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized study..

This facilitates the drug delivery in a regulated manner targeting the therapeutic action with a limited dosage that lessens the side effects in the course of treatment. The drug polymer interaction was validated by XRD studies, whereas the morphology and size characterization by SEM and zetasizer. The average particle size was determined as 193 ± 0.18 nm with a positive zeta potential of 37.9 mV. The in vitro drug release patterns of nanocomposites were comparatively assayed with the standard lithium carbonate which rendered a controlled release in its profile. The in vivo investigation by animal despair studies bestowed a significant difference in the duration of immobility during force swimming and tail suspension tests.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of second-generation antipsychotic, lamotrigine, lithium, or valproate therapy used in adjunction with lamotrigine, lithium, or valproate monotherapy in bipolar depression. A literature search of major electronic databases was conducted in February 2021, and all articles published until then were eligible. Two researchers independently screened relevant publications, extracted data, and evaluated methodological quality according to the Cochrane criteria. RESULTS: Five studies met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis revealed significant differences in the following outcomes: (i) remission rates from depressive episodes (risk ratio [RR]: 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.50, p = 0.04), (ii) improvement in depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 0.21, 95% CI 0.09-0.34, p = 0.001), (iii) improvement in quality of life (SMD: 0.22, 95% CI 0.06-0.37, p = 0.005), and (iv) rate of adverse events during the study period (RR: 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.22, p = 0.008). There was no significant difference between adjunctive therapy and monotherapy in the emergence of suicide-related behaviors, dropout rate during the study period, or rate of manic switching. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that adjunctive second-generation antipsychotics, lamotrigine, lithium, or valproate increase both the benefits and risks in patients with bipolar depression, although there is no significant difference in severe adverse events. Adjunctive therapy should be provided through shared decision-making while considering the patients' condition in clinical settings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Maruki T ; Utsumi T ; Takeshima M ; Fujiwara Y ; Matsui M ; Aoki Y ; Toda H ; Watanabe N ; Watanabe K ; Takaesu Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s40345-022-00271-7 ","Keywords":"Antipsychotic drug\r\nBipolar depression\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLithium\r\nTreatment-resistant depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Maruki T, Utsumi T, Takeshima M, Fujiwara Y, Matsui M, Aoki Y, Toda H, Watanabe N, Watanabe K, and Takaesu Y (2022) Efficacy and safety of adjunctive therapy to lamotrigine, lithium, or valproate monotherapy in bipolar depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials..

Affected individuals have higher rates of other mental health disorders, substance use disorders, and comorbid chronic medical illnesses. New diagnostic criteria and specifiers with attention on mixed features and anxious distress aid the physician in recognizing episode severity and prognosis. Physicians should consider bipolar disorder in any patient presenting with depression. Pharmacotherapy with mood stabilizers, such as lithium, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics, is a first-line treatment that should be continued indefinitely because of the risk of patient relapse. Active lifestyle approaches include good nutrition, exercise, sleep hygiene, and proper weight management. Monotherapy with antidepressants is contraindicated during episodes with mixed features, manic episodes, and in bipolar I disorder. Ongoing management involves monitoring for suicidal ideation, substance use disorders, treatment adherence, and recognizing medical complications of pharmacotherapy. Psychotherapy is a useful adjunct to pharmacotherapy. Patients and their support systems should be educated about the chronic nature of this illness, possible relapse, suicidality, environmental triggers (e.g., seasonal light changes, shift work, other circadian disruption), and the effectiveness of early intervention to reduce complications.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Marzani G ; Price Neff A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAnticonvulsants/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*diagnosis/*drug therapy\r\nCurriculum\r\nEducation, Medical, Continuing\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Practice Guidelines as Topic\r\nPsychotherapy/*standards","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Marzani G, and Price Neff A (2021) Bipolar Disorders: Evaluation and Treatment..

Experimental as well as clinical evidence is presented to support the existence of a close interaction and bi-directional communication between the central nervous and immune systems. The role of major endocrine mechanisms and hormones is discussed. The evidences from experimental work to support the roles of the nervous system with neurotransmitters, the endocrine system with hormones, and the immune system with cytokines are presented. Aging, depression and cancer have a high degree of co-association and share mechanisms which result in cellular immune deficiency. Hormone therapy, zinc replenishment, antidepressants, immunomodulators like MDP act on these pathways to upregulate and improve cellular immunity. The authors believe that the central nervous system (CNS)-immune interaction is an important new frontier to be considered for new combination therapy in diseases with cellular immune deficiency such as cancer particularly in the aged with depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Masek K ; Slánský J ; Petrovický P ; Hadden JW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/S1567-5769(03)00015-8 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nCentral Nervous System/*immunology\r\nEndocrine System/*immunology\r\nHormones/immunology\r\nHumans\r\nInfections/*immunology\r\nNeoplasms/*immunology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Masek K, Slánský J, Petrovický P, and Hadden JW (2003) Neuroendocrine immune interactions in health and disease..

Given these findings, it is plausible that consistently low dietary zinc intakes contribute to depressive symptoms, yet epidemiological data are lacking. The authors tested the hypothesis that low zinc intake is associated with depressive symptoms using cross-sectional data from the population-based Boston Area Community Health survey (2002-2005). METHODS: Dietary and supplement use data were collected by validated food frequency questionnaire. Current depressive symptoms were assessed by the abridged validated Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale and analyzed using multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for sociodemographic, health and lifestyle characteristics. RESULTS: Results showed an interaction (P=0.03) with gender, whereby zinc was associated with depressive symptoms in women (N=2163), but not men (N=1545). Women with low dietary or supplemental zinc intake were more likely to have depressive symptoms (e.g., dietary zinc quartile 1 vs. 4, OR=1.76, 95% CI: 1.26, 2.45; P-trend=0.004; supplemental zinc P-trend=0.03). Associations were stronger among women using antidepressant medications (e.g., total zinc OR=4.75, 95% CI: 1.98, 11.4; P-trend=0.0005). LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional, observational nature of the study leaves uncertain whether the observed associations represent actual causal relationships between zinc intake and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest: (1) gender-specific pathophysiological mechanisms of depression, (2) inadequate dietary zinc intake contributes to depressive symptoms in women, and (3) supplemental zinc is a beneficial adjunct to antidepressant therapy in women. Additional research on both men and women is needed to verify these novel findings. If confirmed by other studies, the potential importance of adequate zinc intake is underscored by the recognized limitations of pharmacotherapy for depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Maserejian NN ; Hall SA ; McKinlay JB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2011.09.039 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBoston/epidemiology\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/blood/drug therapy/*epidemiology/etiology\r\nDiet\r\nDiet Surveys\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLife Style\r\nLogistic Models\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nSex Factors\r\nZinc/*blood","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Maserejian NN, Hall SA, and McKinlay JB (2012) Low dietary or supplemental zinc is associated with depression symptoms among women, but not men, in a population-based epidemiological survey..

This complex disorder is the most common mental health problem in the United States, more common in women, adults over 60 years of age, and those of lower socioeconomic status. According to the DSM III, the major subclassifications related to depression are major depression and bipolar disorder. An integrated causation theory is useful in describing the etiology of this disorder. Generally, signs and symptoms involve changes in affect, cognition, behavior, and physical functioning. Depression may be treated with antidepressant psychotropic medications (tricyclics and MAO inhibitors), lithium carbonate (for bipolar disorder), electroconvulsive therapy, and a variety of psychotherapies. Careful monitoring of the drugs via blood level values must be ongoing. Nursing care of hospitalized depressed persons involves careful monitoring of clients' status and the effectiveness of treatments. Nursing care focuses on three areas of need. Immediate needs are those related to critical and safety issues. Short-term needs are concerned with identifying and reducing or eliminating obvious problem areas which hamper return to community living. Long-term needs are issues related to maintenance of persons in the least depressive state for as long as possible. To provide a sound basis for planning and implementing such care, nurses must understand the dynamics of depression, the issues which dictate selected treatment methods, and the issues which are likely to shape and change the treatment of depression in the future. Nursing must accept the responsibility of acting in a responsible, professional manner to ensure the best possible treatment for clients within the restraints imposed by policy decisions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Maurer FA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Acute Disease\r\nAdult\r\nChild\r\nDepression/drug therapy/*nursing/*therapy\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychotherapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Maurer FA (1986) Acute depression: treatment and nursing strategies for this affective disorder..

TYPES OF COMPARATORS: Supplements, either alone or combined, were compared with either no intervention or placebo. TYPES OF STUDIES: Randomized controlled and pseudo-randomized trials were included. OUTCOMES: Stress and anxiety were assessed using self-report or physiological outcome measures. SEARCH STRATEGY: Published and unpublished studies were sought via MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MedNar, National Institute of Mental Health and the International Association for Women's Mental Health. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Methodological quality was evaluated using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted using the standardized data extraction instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA SYNTHESIS: Due to heterogeneity of the included studies, narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in this review. Essential fatty acids were effective in reducing perceived stress and salivary cortisol levels during pregnancy and anxiety in premenstrual women, and anxiety during menopause in the absence of depression, but were ineffective when depression was disregarded. Disregarding the hormonal phase, EFAs were ineffective in reducing stress or anxiety in four groups of women. Combined magnesium and vitamin B6 supplementation reduced premenstrual anxiety but had no effect when used in isolation and did not affect stress in women suffering from dysmenorrhea when combined or used in isolation. Older women experienced anxiety reduction using vitamin B6, but not folate or vitamin B12. High-dose sustained-release vitamin C was effective in reducing anxiety and blood pressure in response to stress. CONCLUSION: The current review suggests that EFAs may be effective in reducing prenatal stress and salivary cortisol and may reduce anxiety during premenstrual syndrome and during menopause in the absence of depression. Magnesium and vitamin B6 may be effective in combination in reducing premenstrual stress, and vitamin B6 alone may reduce anxiety effectively in older women. High-dose sustained-release vitamin C may reduce anxiety and mitigate increased blood pressure in response to stress. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Essential fatty acids may be effective in reducing prenatal stress and salivary cortisol levels, and premenstrual or menopausal anxiety in the absence of depression. Combining magnesium and vitamin B6 may reduce premenstrual anxiety and vitamin B6 may reduce anxiety in older women. High-dose sustained-release vitamin C may reduce anxiety and mitigate increased blood pressure in response to stress. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Investigating supplementation in longer term studies is warranted and should include compliance testing, the use of inert substances as controls and reliable outcome measures.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McCabe D ; Lisy K ; Lockwood C ; Colbeck M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.11124/JBISRIR-2016-002965 ","Keywords":"Ascorbic Acid/*administration & dosage\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Essential/*administration & dosage\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMagnesium/administration & dosage\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nStress, Psychological/*psychology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin B Complex/*administration & dosage\r\nZinc/administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McCabe D, Lisy K, Lockwood C, and Colbeck M (2017) The impact of essential fatty acid, B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium and zinc supplementation on stress levels in women: a systematic review..

Lithium is among the best proven mood stabilizer therapies for BD, but treatment responses vary considerably. Based upon these and other findings, it has been suggested that lithium-responsive BD may be a genetically distinct phenotype within the mood disorder spectrum. This assertion has practical implications both for the treatment of BD and for understanding the neurobiological basis of the illness: genetic variation within lithium-sensitive signaling pathways may confer preferential treatment response, and the involved genes may underlie BD in some individuals. Presently, the mechanism of lithium is reviewed with an emphasis on gene-expression changes in response to lithium. Within this context, findings from genetic-association studies designed to identify lithium response genes in BD patients are evaluated. Finally, a framework is proposed by which future pharmacogenetic studies can incorporate advances in genetics, molecular biology and bioinformatics in a pathway-based approach to predicting lithium treatment response.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McCarthy MJ ; Leckband SG ; Kelsoe JR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2217/pgs.10.127 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*genetics\r\nGenetic Association Studies/methods/trends\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nPharmacogenetics/methods/*trends\r\nPhenotype\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McCarthy MJ, Leckband SG, and Kelsoe JR (2010) Pharmacogenetics of lithium response in bipolar disorder..

However, no prospective, randomized, controlled study specifically evaluating an antidepressant on suicidality in bipolar disorder has yet been completed. Indeed, antidepressants have not yet been shown to reduce suicide attempts or suicide in depressive disorders and may increase suicidal behavior in pediatric, and possibly adult, major depressive disorder. Available data on the effects of antidepressants on suicidality in bipolar disorder are mixed. Considerable research indicates that mixed states are associated with suicidality and that antidepressants, especially when administered as monotherapy, are associated with both suicidality and manic conversion. In contrast, growing research suggests that antidepressants administered in combination with mood stabilizers may reduce depressive symptoms in patients with bipolar depression. Further, the only prospective, long-term study evaluating antidepressant treatment and mortality in bipolar disorder, although open-label, found antidepressants and/or antipsychotics in combination with lithium, but not lithium alone, reduced suicide in bipolar and unipolar patients (Angst F, et al. J Affect Disord 2002: 68: 167-181). We conclude that antidepressants may induce suicidality in a subset of persons with depressive (and probably anxious) presentations; that this induction may represent a form of manic conversion, and hence a bipolar phenotype, and that lithium's therapeutic properties may include the ability to prevent antidepressant-induced suicidality.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McElroy SL ; Kotwal R ; Kaneria R ; Keck PE Jr; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1399-5618.2006.00348.x ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*epidemiology/psychology\r\nDepression/prevention & control\r\nHumans\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSuicide, Attempted/psychology/*statistics & numerical data","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McElroy SL, Kotwal R, Kaneria R, and Keck PE Jr (2006) Antidepressants and suicidal behavior in bipolar disorder..

QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: A search of MEDLINE and relevant bibliographies showed most studies could be categorized as level III evidence. Few well controlled studies (eg, level I evidence) specify treatment of next choice in rigorously defined treatment-refractory depression (TRD). MAIN MESSAGE: Failure to achieve and sustain full symptom remission affects relatively few treated depressed patients. Most chronically depressed people are not absolutely resistant but are relatively resistant to treatment; they fail to achieve the goals of treatment because of improper diagnosis or insufficient treatment application. The literature on TRD has largely focused on medication strategies; fewer studies investigated psychosocial approaches. The best established augmentation strategies are lithium salts and triidothyronine (T3). Combination antidepressants have become clinical psychiatrists' preferred treatment, despite limited evidence. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains a feasible option for TRD, but response rates are poor among people with TRD. High relapse rates after ECT remain a serious and common clinical dilemma.

Lithium, divalproex, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, and some novel antipsychotics all have level I evidence for treating various aspects of the disorder. MAIN MESSAGE: Treatment of bipolar disorder involves three therapeutic domains: acute mania, acute depression, and maintenance. Lithium has been a mainstay of treatment for some time, but antiepileptic drugs like divalproex, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, along with novel antipsychotic drugs like olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine, alone or in combination, are increasingly being used successfully to treat acute mania and to maintain mood stability.

METHODS: We conducted a PubMed search of all English-language articles involving Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents for manic/mixed states in adults with bipolar I disorder. We also included names of agents established as efficacious in acute mania/mixed states that have not received FDA approval for bipolar disorder. Bibliographies from relevant articles were also searched. The efficacy of each agent in the mixed state subpopulation was reviewed, as evidenced by change from baseline on total scores of mania [e.g., Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)] and depression [e.g., Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)] measures. RESULTS: No available study is dedicated exclusively to the evaluation of mixed state populations. Although key inclusion and exclusion criteria are similar across treatment studies, mixed states have been variably defined and measured. The use of conventional manic and depressive metrics in bipolar mixed states perpetuates the unproven notion that mixed states are the consequence of coexisting depression and mania. Notwithstanding the methodological limitations, there are numerically more studies that exist for atypical antipsychotic agents than for any other class. On the basis of symptomatic improvement, recommendations for and/or strong admonishments against any established antimanic agents (e.g., lithium) cannot be made. An emergent signal supports combination treatment strategies (e.g., atypical antipsychotic plus divalproex) over mood stabilizer monotherapy (e.g., divalproex). Available evidence does not empirically support the hypothesis that conventional antipsychotics engender and/or amplify depressive symptoms in bipolar mixed states. CONCLUSIONS: All proven antimanic agents (including lithium), can be recommended in the treatment of mixed/dysphoric states. The totality of evidence with attention paid to the therapeutic index of each agent would suggest that atypical antipsychotics and divalproex be considered as first-line treatment, with lithium and carbamazepine as second-line. Most individuals will require combination therapy for the treatment of mixed states; variable combinations of atypical antipsychotics and conventional mood stabilizers have the most replicated evidence.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McIntyre RS ; Yoon J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1399-5618.2012.00990.x ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McIntyre RS, and Yoon J (2012) Efficacy of antimanic treatments in mixed states..

Moreover, at least half will not achieve and sustain remission following multiple pharmacological approaches. Herein, we succinctly review treatment modalities proven effective in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: We conducted a review of computerized databases (PubMed, Google Scholar) from 1980 to April 2013. Articles selected for review were based on author consensus, adequacy of sample size, the use of a standardized experimental procedure, validated assessment measures and overall manuscript quality. RESULTS: The evidence base supporting augmentation of conventional antidepressants with atypical antipsychotics (i.e., aripiprazole, quetiapine, and olanzapine) is the most extensive and rigorous of all pharmacological approaches in TRD. Emerging evidence supports the use of some psychostimulants (i.e., lisdexamfetamine) as well as aerobic exercise. In addition, treatments informed by pathogenetic disease models provide preliminary evidence for the efficacy of immune-inflammatory based therapies and metabolic interventions. Manual based psychotherapies remain a treatment option, with the most compelling evidence for cognitive behavioral therapy. Disparate neurostimulation strategies are also available for individuals insufficiently responsive to pharmacotherapy and/or psychosocial interventions. LIMITATIONS: Compared to non-treatment-resistant depression, TRD has been less studied. Most clinical studies on TRD have focused on pharmacotherapy-resistant depression, with relatively fewer studies evaluating \"next choice\" treatments in individuals who do not initially respond to psychosocial and/or neurostimulatory treatments. CONCLUSION: The pathoetiological heterogeneity of MDD/TRD invites the need for mechanistically dissimilar, and empirically validated, treatment approaches for TRD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McIntyre RS ; Filteau MJ ; Martin L ; Patry S ; Carvalho A ; Cha DS ; Barakat M ; Miguelez M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2013.10.043 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAlgorithms\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/diagnosis/*therapy\r\nHumans\r\nAtypical antipsychotics\r\nAugmentation\r\nCombination\r\nLithium\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nTreatment-resistant depression (TRD)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McIntyre RS, Filteau MJ, Martin L, Patry S, Carvalho A, Cha DS, Barakat M, and Miguelez M (2014) Treatment-resistant depression: definitions, review of the evidence, and algorithmic approach..

Pharmacological augmentation is one therapeutic option for TRD, with lithium and quetiapine currently recommended as first-line agents. Patient opinions about pharmacological augmentation may affect treatment outcomes, yet these have not been systematically explored. AIMS: This study aimed to qualitatively assess patient experiences of lithium and quetiapine augmentation. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 patients from the ongoing lithium versus quetiapine open-label trial comparing these augmentation agents in patients with TRD. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and a thematic analysis was used to assess patient opinions of each agent. RESULTS: Four main themes were generated from the thematic analysis: 'Initial concerns', 'Experience of side effects', 'Perception of treatment efficacy' and 'Positive perception of treatment monitoring'. Patient accounts indicated a predominantly positive experience of lithium and quetiapine augmentation. Greater apprehension about side effects was reported for lithium prior to treatment initiation, but greater experience of negative side effects was reported for quetiapine. Clinical monitoring was perceived positively. CONCLUSION: Patient accounts suggested treatment augmentation with lithium or quetiapine was acceptable and helpful for most patients. However, anticipation and experiences of adverse side effects may prevent some patients from benefitting from these treatments.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McKeown L ; Taylor RW ; Day E ; Shah R ; Marwood L ; Tee H ; Kerr-Gaffney J ; Oprea E ; Geddes JR ; McAllister-Williams RH ; Young AH ; Cleare AJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/02698811221089042 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects\r\nDepression\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/drug therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/adverse effects\r\nQuetiapine Fumarate/adverse effects\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nTreatment-resistant depression\r\nmajor depressive disorder\r\npharmacotherapy\r\nqualitative\r\nthematic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McKeown L, Taylor RW, Day E, Shah R, Marwood L, Tee H, Kerr-Gaffney J, Oprea E, Geddes JR, McAllister-Williams RH, Young AH, and Cleare AJ (2022) Patient perspectives of lithium and quetiapine augmentation treatment in treatment-resistant depression: A qualitative assessment..

Although lithium is present in the pharmacotherapy of psychiatric illnesses for decades, its precise mechanism of action is still not clarified. Today lithium represents first-line therapy for bipolar disorders (because it possesses both antimanic and antidepressant properties) and the adjunctive treatment for major depression (due to its antisuicidal effects). Beside, lithium showed some protective effects in neurological diseases including acute neural injury, chronic degenerative conditions, Alzheimer's disease as well as in treating leucopenia, hepatitis and some renal diseases. Recent evidence suggested that lithium also possesses some anticancer properties due to its inhibition of Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) which is included in the regulation of a lot of important cellular processes such as: glycogen metabolism, inflammation, immunomodulation, apoptosis, tissue injury, regeneration etc. Although recent evidence suggested a potential utility of lithium in different conditions, its broader use in clinical practice still trails. The reason for this is a narrow therapeutic index of lithium, numerous toxic effects in various organ systems and some clinically relevant interactions with other drugs. Additionally, it is necessary to perform more preclinical as well as clinical studies in order to a precise therapeutic range of lithium, as well as its detailed mechanism of action. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge concerning the pharmacological and toxicological effects of lithium.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Medić B ; Stojanović M ; Stimec BV ; Divac N ; Vujović KS ; Stojanović R ; Čolović M ; Krstić D ; Prostran M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/0929867325666180904124733 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents\r\nAntimanic Agents\r\nApoptosis\r\nBipolar Disorder\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*chemistry\r\nLithium\r\nadverse effects of lithium\r\ndrug interactions with lithium\r\nlithium in preclinical and clinical studies\r\nmechanism of action of lithium\r\nmechanism of action of lithium in the brain\r\npharmacological effects.","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Medić B, Stojanović M, Stimec BV, Divac N, Vujović KS, Stojanović R, Čolović M, Krstić D, and Prostran M (2020) Lithium - Pharmacological and Toxicological Aspects: The Current State of the Art..

Magnesium sulfate is a treatment option that may offer great potential for patients with treatment-resistant depression based on prior work in animals and humans. METHODS: Twelve subjects with mild or moderate treatment-resistant depression were randomized into a double-blind crossover trial to receive an infusion of 4 g of magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose or placebo infusion of 5% dextrose with a 5-day washout in between the 8-day intervention period. Subjects were assessed before and after the intervention for serum and urine magnesium, lipid panel, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. RESULTS: We found a difference in serum magnesium from day 2 to 8 (pre-infusion) (P < 0.002) and from baseline to day 8 (P < 0.02). No changes were noted on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression or the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 24 h post-treatment, but as serum magnesium increased from baseline to day 7, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 decreased from baseline to day 7 (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Magnesium sulfate did not significantly affect depression 24 h post-infusion, but other results were consistent with the literature. The association between changes in serum magnesium and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 supports the idea that magnesium sulfate may be used to address treatment-resistant depression, an ongoing medical challenge.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mehdi SM ; Atlas SE ; Qadir S ; Musselman D ; Goldberg S ; Woolger JM ; Corredor R ; Abbas MH ; Arosemena L ; Caccamo S ; Campbell CS ; Farooqi A ; Gao J ; Konefal J ; Lages LC ; Lantigua L ; Lopez J ; Padilla V ; Rasul A ; Ray AM ; Simões HG ; Tiozzo E ; Lewis JE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/pcn.12480 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nGlucose/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nInfusions, Intravenous\r\nMagnesium Sulfate/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\ndepressive symptoms\r\nintervention study\r\nintravenous infusions\r\nmagnesium sulfate\r\ntreatment-resistant depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mehdi SM, Atlas SE, Qadir S, Musselman D, Goldberg S, Woolger JM, Corredor R, Abbas MH, Arosemena L, Caccamo S, Campbell CS, Farooqi A, Gao J, Konefal J, Lages LC, Lantigua L, Lopez J, Padilla V, Rasul A, Ray AM, Simões HG, Tiozzo E, and Lewis JE (2017) Double-blind, randomized crossover study of intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate versus 5% dextrose on depressive symptoms in adults with treatment-resistant depression..

The HTA will be part of the basis for national guidelines for suicide prevention. Methods The work was carried out by a review team of external professionals. A systematic literature search was performed using the databases Medline, Embase, PsychInfo, Cinahl and Swemed. The literature was evaluated in a stepwise manner according to general principles of HTA. At step 1 the professionals reviewed 3854 abstracts, 171 articles were reviewed for relevance at step 2 and at step 3 internal and external validation of the 83 articles found relevant was done by the whole group. Results and discussion Ten high-quality articles and 52 articles of moderate quality were included. Many of the randomized controlled studies described cognitive behaviour therapy and related forms of psychotherapy and treatment with antidepressants, but other types of psychotherapy and drug treatment were also investigated. There are a number of problems with the external validity of the literature. The majority of the studies were done in countries with cultures and ways of organizing the health care system quite different from Norway. Many of the interventions were of short duration and the number of patients included was small, therefore there was a risk of overlooking important effects (type II error). The inclusion and exclusion criteria were not always well described and in a number of studies individuals with high risk of suicide were not included. A number of studies were performed with patients hospitalized in general hospitals after episodes of deliberate self harm. It is not clear to what degree the results by these studies can be used by psychiatric health workers. The small number of patients make it impossible to extract meaningful results for subgroups who may be presumed to have different needs and respond differently to interventions. In addition, in many studies patients with comorbidity like substance abuse were excluded, in clinical practice suicidal patients commonly have extensive comorbidity. Conclusions Psychotherapy Some studies report that psychotherapy reduces suicidality more than the treatment given to the control group. This is the case with cognitive behaviour therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy and day care with psychodynamic psychotherapy to patients with borderline personality disorder, and multisystem therapy given to young persons. Drug interventions In the majority of studies of antidepressants, the study drug reduced depression, suicidal ideation and in some cases suicide attempts more than placebo. However, the patients in the studies generally had low risk of suicide and suicidal persons had often been excluded. Lithium significantly reduced the incidence of suicide and suicide attempts. Some studies reported that suicidal behaviour in patients with schizophrenia was reduced more through the use of clozapine than by other neuroleptics. Electroconvulsive therapy No methodologically acceptable study on the effect of ECT on suicidal behaviour was found. General limitations The majority of the studies described short-term interventions and had methodological weaknesses. The majority of studies excluded patients at high risk for suicide. The majority of studies included few patients, thus clinically significant effects may have been overlooked (type II error).","Comments":"","TypeName":"Book, Whole","Authors":"Mehlum L ; Dieserud G ; Ekeberg Ø ; Grøholt B ; Mellesdal L ; Walby F ; Myhre KI ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Suicide\r\nPsychotherapy\r\nDrug Therapy\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nSecondary Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mehlum L, Dieserud G, Ekeberg Ø, Grøholt B, Mellesdal L, Walby F, and Myhre KI (2006) Prevention of Suicide.

This study examined the effects of iron administration on psychological status of children and adolescents with reduced serum ferritin concentration. METHODS: This prospective study evaluated 19 participants aged 6-15 years with serum ferritin levels <30 ng/mL who visited a mental health clinic and received oral iron administration for 12 weeks. The participants were assessed using the Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S), Proﬁle of Mood States 2nd Edition Youth-Short (POMS), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). In addition to serum ferritin, blood biochemical values such as hemoglobin (Hb) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were examined. School attendance was recorded. RESULTS: The most prevalent physical symptoms were fatigability and insomnia. The CGI-S, PSQI, and CES-D scores decreased significantly following iron supplementation, whereas the scores of almost all POMS subscales improved significantly at week 12. No participant had hemoglobin levels <12 g/dL. Serum ferritin concentration increased significantly, whereas Hb and MCV remained unchanged. At baseline, 74% of the participants did not attend school regularly; this number improved to varying degrees by week 12. CONCLUSIONS: Serum ferritin levels would be preferable to be measured in children and adolescents with insomnia and/or fatigability regardless of psychiatric diagnoses or gender. Iron supplementation can improve the hypoferritinemia-related psychological symptoms of children and adolescents, such as poor concentration, anxiety, depression, low energy and/or irritability.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mikami K ; Akama F ; Kimoto K ; Okazawa H ; Orihashi Y ; Onishi Y ; Takahashi Y ; Yabe H ; Yamamoto K ; Matsumoto H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1272/jnms.JNMS.2022_89-216 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAnxiety\r\nChild\r\nDepression\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFerritins\r\nHemoglobins\r\nHumans\r\n*Iron/therapeutic use\r\n*Iron Deficiencies/drug therapy/psychology\r\nProspective Studies\r\nSleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders\r\nadolescents\r\nchildren\r\nferritin\r\niron supplementation\r\nmental health\r\npsychiatry","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mikami K, Akama F, Kimoto K, Okazawa H, Orihashi Y, Onishi Y, Takahashi Y, Yabe H, Yamamoto K, and Matsumoto H (2022) Iron Supplementation for Hypoferritinemia-Related Psychological Symptoms in Children and Adolescents..

Six patients were on fluvoxamine monotherapy and six were on combined fluvoxamine-lithium therapy. The treatment response was determined using 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Blood samples were collected during 48 h after a single dose administration of 100 mg fluvoxamine, and five times at steady state after repeated doses of 100 mg fluvoxamine per day. The evaluation of 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression Scores showed a significant clinical improvement 2 and 4 weeks after the beginning of the therapy in both groups (p < 0.01). However, 2 weeks after the administration of the drug(s) had started, significant differences (p < 0.05) in efficacy between the two treatments in favour of the fluvoxamine-lithium combination were found. Plasma concentrations of fluvoxamine were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The comparison of the measured concentrations of fluvoxamine showed a similar course of the plasma concentration-time curves in both groups of patients. Pharmacokinetic parameters of fluvoxamine did not show any significant difference on the comparison between the groups. According to the results from this study, it is evident that lithium does not affect plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetics of fluvoxamine in depressed patients on concomitant treatment with these two drugs. However, the effect achieved with the combination was better.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Miljković BR ; Pokrajac M ; Timotijević I ; Varagić V ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/*therapeutic use\r\nArea Under Curve\r\nBiological Availability\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDrug Interactions\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nFluvoxamine/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use\r\nHalf-Life\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMetabolic Clearance Rate\r\nMiddle Aged","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Miljković BR, Pokrajac M, Timotijević I, and Varagić V (1997) The influence of lithium on fluvoxamine therapeutic efficacy and pharmacokinetics in depressed patients on combined fluvoxamine-lithium therapy..

Further, this work explores studies examining the safety and effectiveness of pharmacological techniques for accelerating the therapeutic effects of antidepressant medication. A review of the literature pertaining to strategies for accelerating antidepressant medication effects was accomplished using the MEDLINE database, employing the key title words, antidepressant, rapid, and accelerating. A preponderance of evidence suggests that there is a multiple week latency for the onset of action of antidepressant medications. This latency appears to apply to virtually all standard antidepressants and may reflect slow adaptive changes to the inciting event of increased monoamine levels. Several strategies have received attention as potential strategies with which to accelerate the therapeutic effects of antidepressant medications. These include the use of high initial doses of some agents and also the use of initial augmentation strategies. Specifically, studies exist suggesting the acceleration of antidepressant effects using high initial doses of tricyclic antidepressants or venlafaxine, as well as the potential for acceleration by using initial augmentation with psychostimulants, lithium, or pindolol. Considering the morbidity and mortality associated with severe depression, a critical need exist for the exploration of ways in which to achieve antidepressant effects more quickly. A number of preliminary studies suggest strategies for the rapid treatment of depression, each with an apparent high degree of safety. Further investigations in more carefully defined patient populations and utilizing advances in the techniques for assessing antidepressant onset are needed.

The purpose of this review is to discuss findings relevant to bipolar disorder and suicide. RECENT FINDINGS: Risk factors include male gender, living alone, divorced, no children, Caucasian, younger age (< 35 years), elderly age (> 75 years), unemployment, and a personal history of suicide attempt and family history of suicide attempt or suicide completion, as well as predominant depressive polarity. Suicide is associated with the depressed or mixed subtypes, not mania. Although there are emerging treatments for bipolar depression, such as ketamine and TMS, lithium remains the only medication associated with lowered suicide rates in bipolar disorder. Understanding clinical and demographic risk factors for suicide in bipolar disorder remains the best way to prevent suicidal behavior. Early intervention and treatment with anti-suicidal medications, such as lithium, along with close observation and follow-up is the best way to mitigate suicide in patients with bipolar disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Miller JN ; Black DW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11920-020-1130-0 ","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*psychology\r\nHumans\r\nRisk Factors\r\n*Suicidal Ideation\r\nSuicide, Attempted/*prevention & control/*psychology\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nSuicide\r\nSuicide attempt\r\nSuicide completion\r\nSuicide risk factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Miller JN, and Black DW (2020) Bipolar Disorder and Suicide: a Review..

Recent data suggest that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists may lead to rapid improvement of depressive symptoms lasting up to 2 weeks. We hypothesized that the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist magnesium sulfate would elicit antidepressant effects subsequent to its receipt by women receiving peripartum seizure prophylaxis for a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the frequency of depressive symptoms at 2 weeks and 6 weeks after delivery between women who did and did not receive peripartum magnesium sulfate for a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: This prospective cohort study included women with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy at ≥34 weeks' gestation with singleton gestations. Magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis was administered at the obstetrician's discretion. The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology survey was administered before hospital discharge and again at 2 weeks and 6 weeks after delivery to assess for postpartum depressive symptoms. The primary outcome for this study was the change in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology score from baseline to 2 weeks after delivery, which was analyzed both continuously and categorically (any symptom worsening vs stability or improvement). Secondary outcomes included the change in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology score from baseline to 6 weeks after delivery and the proportion of women who experienced an increase in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology score at 6 weeks after delivery. RESULTS: Of the 342 women enrolled, 39% (n=134) received magnesium sulfate. Compared with women who did not receive magnesium, women who received magnesium had a significantly smaller change in their mean Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology score (0.6±3.4 vs 1.6±3.0; P=.015) and also were less likely to have an increase in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology score at 2 weeks after delivery (52% vs 67%; P=.022). These differences were not present at 6 weeks after delivery. After controlling for potential confounders, women who received magnesium continued to have a lower odds of having an increased Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology score from baseline at 2 weeks after delivery than women who did not receive magnesium (adjusted odds ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.98). CONCLUSION: Peripartum magnesium was associated with less of an exacerbation in depressive symptoms in the immediate postpartum period. Given the implications of postpartum depression on maternal and child health and the lack of existing prophylaxis, randomized trials should examine this novel potential prophylactic therapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Miller ES ; Sakowicz A ; Roy A ; Wang A ; Yang A ; Ciolino J ; Grobman WA ; Wisner KL ; Yee LM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ajogmf.2021.100407 ","Keywords":"Child\r\n*Depression/drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\n*Magnesium Sulfate/therapeutic use\r\nPeripartum Period\r\nPostpartum Period\r\nPregnancy\r\nProspective Studies\r\nNMDA antagonist\r\nmagnesium sulfate\r\npostpartum depression\r\npreeclampsia","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Miller ES, Sakowicz A, Roy A, Wang A, Yang A, Ciolino J, Grobman WA, Wisner KL, and Yee LM (2021) Is peripartum magnesium sulfate associated with a reduction in postpartum depressive symptoms?.

Combinations of lithium plus valproic acid (Li/VPA) and lithium plus carbamazepine (Li/CBZ) are used in clinical practice but were not previously compared in a head-to-head trial. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this trial was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of Li/VPA versus Li/CBZ in treating type 1 BD in any phase of illness in young individuals. METHODS: LICAVAL was a randomized, unicenter, open-label, parallel-group trial that was conducted from January 2009 to December 2012 in a tertiary hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. Participants were between 18 and 35 years old and were followed up for 2 years. Our primary outcome was the number of participants achieving/maintaining response and remission during the acute and maintenance phases of BD treatment, respectively. Other outcomes assessed were symptom severity and adverse events throughout the study. In the analysis of the primary outcome, we compared groups by using a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance and estimated effect sizes by using Cohen's d. RESULTS: Of our 64 participants, 36 were allocated to Li/VPA and 28 to Li/CBZ. Our sample was composed predominantly of females (66.6%) and the average age was 27.8 years. A total of 27 (45.0%) participants had depression, 17 (28.3%) had mania/hypomania, and 16 (26.7%) had a mixed state. We found no between-group differences in CGI-BP (Clinical Global Impression Scale modified for use in bipolar disorder) scores (P = 0.326) or in any other outcome. Side effects differed significantly between groups only in the first week of treatment (P = 0.021), and there were more side effects in the Li/VPA group. Also, the Li/VPA group gained weight (+2.1 kg) whereas the Li/CBZ group presented slight weight loss (-0.2 kg). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that Li/VPA and Li/CBZ have similar efficacy and tolerability in BD but that Li/CBZ might have metabolic advantages in the long term.

Chronic restraint stress (CRS) is well validated and is one of the most commonly used models to induce depressive-like behavior in rodents. The present study aimed to evaluate whether fluoxetine (FLU 5 mg/kg) and zinc (Zn 10mg/kg) given simultaneously induce a more pronounced antidepressant-like effect in the CRS model than both those compounds given alone. Behavioral assessment was performed using the tail suspension and splash tests (TST and ST, respectively). Furthermore, the effects of CRS, FLU and Zn given alone and combined treatment with FLU + Zn on the expression of proteins involved in the apoptotic, inflammatory, and epigenetic processes were evaluated in selected brain structures (prefrontal cortex, PFC; and hippocampus, Hp) using Western blot analysis or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The results obtained indicated that three hours (per day) of immobilization for 4 weeks induced prominent depressive symptoms that manifested as increased immobility time in the TST, as well as decreased number and grooming time in the ST. Behavioral changes induced by CRS were reversed by both FLU (5 and 10 mg/kg) or Zn (10 mg/kg). Zinc supplementation (10 mg/kg) slightly increases the effectiveness of FLU (5 mg/kg) in the TST. However, it significantly increased the activity of FLU in the ST compared to the effect induced by FLU and Zn alone. Biochemical studies revealed that neither CRS nor FLU and Zn given alone or in combined treatment alter the expression of proteins involved in apoptotic or inflammatory processes. CRS induced major alterations in histone deacetylase (HDAC) levels by increasing the level of HADC1 and decreasing the level of HADC4 in the PFC and Hp, decreasing the level of HADC6 in the PFC but increasing it in Hp. Interestingly, FLU + Zn treatment reversed CRS-induced changes in HDAC levels in the Hp, indicating that HDAC modulation is linked to FLU + Zn treatment and this effect is structure-specific.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Misztak P ; Sowa-Kućma M ; Pańczyszyn-Trzewik P ; Szewczyk B ; Nowak G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/molecules27010022 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBrain\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nFluoxetine/*pharmacology\r\nHindlimb Suspension\r\nHistone Deacetylases/*metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nPyroptosis\r\nStress, Psychological/metabolism\r\nZinc/*pharmacology\r\nan animal model of depression\r\nantidepressants\r\nchronic restraint stress\r\nfluoxetine\r\nzinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Misztak P, Sowa-Kućma M, Pańczyszyn-Trzewik P, Szewczyk B, and Nowak G (2021) Antidepressant-like Effects of Combined Fluoxetine and Zinc Treatment in Mice Exposed to Chronic Restraint Stress Are Related to Modulation of Histone Deacetylase..

In addition to those agents, a number of other anticonvulsants (in particular lamotrigine, gabapentin, and topiramate) are in trials, as are the atypical antipsychotics clozapine and risperidone, and other novel compounds. This article critically reviews the evidence from controlled trials of these proposed \"mood stabilizers,\" highlighting the strengths and limitations of the data for each compound. A major challenge to the field is the capacity to prove the prophylactic properties of agents for which effectiveness in acute mania and/or bipolar depression has been demonstrated. Finally, as the mechanisms of agents such as lithium are now becoming apparent, and the possibility of understanding the molecular defects underpinning the condition is no longer highly fanciful, the prospect of targeted therapies is considered feasible by both academia and the pharmaceutical industry.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mitchell PB ; Malhi GS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.med.53.082901.103933 ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\n*Pharmacopoeias as Topic\r\nUnited States","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mitchell PB, and Malhi GS (2002) The expanding pharmacopoeia for bipolar disorder..

This article reviews current and emerging medications for bipolar disorder. Most of the emerging treatments in pharmaceutical industry developmental programmes are new or modified anticonvulsants or atypical antipsychotics.

They are required for fundamental life processes such as cell division and differentiation and protein synthesis. Thus a deficiency of these essential elements is associated with an enormous health risk that can ultimately lead to death. In recent years, studies have provided valuable information on the involvement of essential elements in psychiatric disorders, in particular depression and anxiety. There is strong evidence indicating that deficiency of essential elements can lead to the development of depressive and/or anxiogenic behaviour and supplementation can enhance therapeutic effect of antidepressants and anxiolytics. This review presents the most important results from preclinical and clinical studies showing involvement of essential elements such as zinc, magnesium, lithium, iron, calcium and chromium in depression and anxiety. From these studies it is evident that different types of depression and anxiety respond to treatment at different receptors indicating that the underlying mechanisms are slightly different. Furthermore, administration of low dose antidepressants supplemented with an element is effective and can reduce unwanted side effects in different types of depression/anxiety.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Młyniec K ; Davies CL ; de Agüero Sánchez IG; Pytka K ; Budziszewska B ; Nowak G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pharep.2014.03.001 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety/drug therapy/*etiology/metabolism\r\nCalcium/deficiency/metabolism\r\nDepression/drug therapy/*etiology/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nIron/metabolism\r\nIron Deficiencies\r\nLithium/deficiency/metabolism\r\nMagnesium Deficiency/complications/metabolism\r\nTrace Elements/deficiency/*metabolism\r\nZinc/deficiency/metabolism\r\nDepression\r\nLithium\r\nMagnesium\r\nTrace elements\r\nZinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Młyniec K, Davies CL, de Agüero Sánchez IG, Pytka K, Budziszewska B, and Nowak G (2014) Essential elements in depression and anxiety.

An antagonist of the glutamatergic NMDA receptor - namely, zinc - plays a part in maintaining homeostasis between glutamate and GABA via the GPR39 receptor, which has been found to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression. In this study we investigated the behavioral response resulting from chronic or acute treatment with monoamine-based antidepressants, such as imipramine, escitalopram or reboxetine, and from glutamate-based MK-801 or ketamine, as measured by the forced swim test (FST) in GPR39 knockout (GPR39 KO, -/-) mice versus wild-type (WT, +/+) controls. All the tested agents reduced the immobility time in the FST in the wild-type animals. However, only chronic or acute administration of MK-801 and ketamine (but not monoamine-based antidepressants) were active in the FST in GPR39 KO mice.

Patients suffering from major depression show significantly reduced zinc levels, which are normalized following successful antidepressant treatment. Recent studies have shown the interaction between zinc, GPR39 and neuropeptides, including galanin and neuropeptide Y (NPY). The zinc-sensing receptor GPR39 forms heterotrimers with 5-HT(1A) and the galanin receptor GalR(1) upon their co-expression in mammalian cells. The oligomerization of these heterotrimers is regulated by the zinc concentration, and this may have an influence on depressive-like behavior. The antidepressant-like effect of zinc is linked to elevated levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in brain structures associated with emotion, such as the hippocampus and the amygdala. BDNF regulates neuropeptides, including NPY, cholecystokinin (CCK), and substance P or galanin, which are also implicated in mood disorders. This review focuses for the first time on the interaction between zinc, the GPR39 zinc receptor, BDNF and selected neuropeptides in terms of depression in order to determine its possible role in the neuropharmacology of that illness.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mlyniec K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1570159X19666210225153404 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\n*Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor\r\n*Depression\r\nHumans\r\n*Neuropeptides\r\n*Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics\r\nZinc\r\nBDNF\r\nGPR39\r\nGPR39.\r\nantidepressants\r\ndepression\r\nneuropeptides\r\nzinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mlyniec K (2021) Interaction between Zinc, GPR39, BDNF and Neuropeptides in Depression..

The authors conducted a literature search in PubMed and reviewed key studies, other algorithms and guidelines, and their references. Treatments were prioritized considering three main considerations: (1) effectiveness in treating the current episode, (2) preventing potential relapses to depression, and (3) minimizing side effects over the short and long term. The algorithm presupposes that clinicians have made an accurate diagnosis, decided how to manage contributing medical causes (including substance misuse), discontinued antidepressants, and considered the patient's childbearing potential. We propose different algorithms for mixed and nonmixed mania. Patients with mixed mania may be treated first with a second-generation antipsychotic, of which the first choice is quetiapine because of its greater efficacy for depressive symptoms and episodes in bipolar disorder. Valproate and then either lithium or carbamazepine may be added. For nonmixed mania, lithium is the first-line recommendation. A second-generation antipsychotic can be added. Again, quetiapine is favored, but if quetiapine is unacceptable, risperidone is the next choice. Olanzapine is not considered a first-line treatment due to its long-term side effects, but it could be second-line. If the patient, whether mixed or nonmixed, is still refractory to the above medications, then depending on what has already been tried, consider carbamazepine, haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone, and valproate first tier; aripiprazole, asenapine, and ziprasidone second tier; and clozapine third tier (because of its weaker evidence base and greater side effects). Electroconvulsive therapy may be considered at any point in the algorithm if the patient has a history of positive response or is intolerant of medications.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mohammad O ; Osser DN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/HRP.0000000000000018 ","Keywords":"*Algorithms\r\n*Antipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nClinical Protocols/*standards\r\nHumans\r\nPsychopharmacology/*standards","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mohammad O, and Osser DN (2014) The psychopharmacology algorithm project at the Harvard South Shore Program: an algorithm for acute mania..

Lithium as a mainstay in the treatment of depression is still considered gold standard treatment. Similar to lithium another agent agmatine has also central protective role against depression. Since, both agmatine and lithium modulate various effects through interaction with NMDA receptor, therefore, in current study we aimed to investigate the synergistic antidepressant-like effect of agmatine with lithium in mouse force swimming test. Also to know whether if such effect is due to interaction with NMDA receptor. In our present study we found that when potent dose of lithium (30mg/kg) was administered, it significantly decreased the immobility time. Also, when subeffective dose of agmatine (0.01mg/kg) was coadministered with subeffective dose of lithium (3mg/kg), it potentiated the antidepressant-like effect of subeffective dose of lithium. For the involvement of NMDA receptor in such effect, we administered NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (0.05mg/kg) with a combination of subeffective dose of lithium (3mg/kg) and agmatine (0.001mg/kg). A significant antidepressant-like effect was observed. Furthermore, when subeffective dose (50 and 75mg/kg) of NMDA was given it inhibited the synergistic effect of agmatine (0.01mg/kg) with lithium (3mg/kg). Hence, our finding demonstrate that agmatine have synergistic effect with lithium which is mediated by NMDA receptor pathway.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mohseni G ; Ostadhadi S ; Imran-Khan M ; Norouzi-Javidan A ; Zolfaghari S ; Haddadi NS ; Dehpour AR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopha.2017.01.119 ","Keywords":"Agmatine/*pharmacology\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nDizocilpine Maleate/pharmacology\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nLithium/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nN-Methylaspartate/*metabolism\r\nReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism\r\nSignal Transduction/*drug effects\r\nSwimming/*physiology\r\nAgmatine\r\nForced swimming test\r\nLithium\r\nMice\r\nNMDA","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mohseni G, Ostadhadi S, Imran-Khan M, Norouzi-Javidan A, Zolfaghari S, Haddadi NS, and Dehpour AR (2017) Agmatine enhances the antidepressant-like effect of lithium in mouse forced swimming test through NMDA pathway..

The present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to examine the effect of prenatal selenium supplementation on the postpartum depression level in Iranian women. DESIGN: A total of 166 primigravid pregnant women in the first trimester of pregnancy, were randomized to receive 100 μg of selenium (n = 83) or a placebo (n = 83) per day until delivery. The symptoms of postpartum depression were evaluated during the eight weeks following delivery by means of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Serum selenium concentrations were measured at baseline and at the end of study. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in demographic characteristics and perceived social support between the selenium and control groups at baseline (p > 0.05). There were 22 drop-outs in the selenium-supplemented group and 19 in the placebo group. Forty-four women in the selenium group and 41 women in the placebo group completed the trial and the EPDS questionnaire. Selenium supplementation was associated with a significant increase in mean serum selenium concentration at term (p < 0.001) but remained unchanged in the control group. The mean EPDS score in the selenium group was significantly lower than that of the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that supplementation with selenium during pregnancy might be an effective approach for the prevention of postpartum depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mokhber N ; Namjoo M ; Tara F ; Boskabadi H ; Rayman MP ; Ghayour-Mobarhan M ; Sahebkar A ; Majdi MR ; Tavallaie S ; Azimi-Nezhad M ; Shakeri MT ; Nematy M ; Oladi M ; Mohammadi M ; Ferns G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3109/14767058.2010.482598 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nDepression, Postpartum/*prevention & control\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIran\r\nPregnancy\r\nSelenium/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nTrace Elements/*therapeutic use\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mokhber N, Namjoo M, Tara F, Boskabadi H, Rayman MP, Ghayour-Mobarhan M, Sahebkar A, Majdi MR, Tavallaie S, Azimi-Nezhad M, Shakeri MT, Nematy M, Oladi M, Mohammadi M, and Ferns G (2011) Effect of supplementation with selenium on postpartum depression: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial..

A basic problem is that the treatments used in treating bipolar depression were developed and proven effective for other disease states: antidepressants for unipolar depression, and mood stabilizers for mania. The panel addressed four unresolved questions regarding depression in relation to bipolar disorder: (1) the relative effectiveness of different antidepressant treatments; (2) the relative likelihood of mood destabilization with different antidepressant treatments; (3) the effectiveness and role of mood-stabilizing medicines as antidepressants; and (4) the optimal approach to mixed states. The selection of an antidepressant depends both on its relative lack of mania- or hypomania-provoking potential and on its effectiveness against bipolar depression. There is little definitive evidence distinguishing effectiveness of the major groups of antidepressive agents, so side-effect profiles and pharmacokinetics are major considerations. The underlying bipolar disorder should be treated with mood stabilizers started simultaneously with any antidepressive treatments. Lithium, divalproex sodium and carbamazepine have all been found to be helpful, to some extent, in treating bipolar depressive episodes as well as for long-term mood stabilization. There is little evidence for long-term benefits of antidepressive agents in bipolar disorder, and some evidence that they may destabilize the disorder. Therefore, in contrast to the long-term use of mood-stabilizers, antidepressant use is recommended on a temporary basis. The duration of antidepressant treatment is determined by past history in terms of liability for mood destabilization, and by the ability of the patient to tolerate gradual antidepressant discontinuation without return of depression. Mixed states, where symptoms of depression and mania coexist, are regarded as a predictor of relatively poor response to lithium, and divalproex has been found to be more effective. Carbamazepine may too be useful in mixed states. Most patients with mixed states in actual practice require combinations of mood stabilizers, though there is little controlled data regarding such co-prescription, especially from a long-term perspective.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Montgomery SA ; Schatzberg AF ; Guelfi JD ; Kasper S ; Nemeroff C ; Swann A ; Zajecka J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0165-0327(00)00178-6 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nPrognosis\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Montgomery SA, Schatzberg AF, Guelfi JD, Kasper S, Nemeroff C, Swann A, and Zajecka J (2000) Pharmacotherapy of depression and mixed states in bipolar disorder..

Our main goal was to investigate the potential clinical significance of these findings in relation to bipolar disorder. METHOD: The longitudinal effect of lithium on brain gray matter volume was investigated in well-characterized (DSM-IV criteria) bipolar depressed subjects (N = 28) at baseline (medication-free) and after lithium administration (4 weeks). Total brain gray matter, prefrontal gray matter, and left subgenual prefrontal gray matter volumes were determined using validated semiautomated segmentation and region of interest methodology. The study was conducted from November 1997 until April 2004 at Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Mich. RESULTS: Significant increases in total brain gray matter volume in bipolar subjects were observed after 4 weeks of lithium administration (p = .0043). Moreover, regional analyses in the bipolar subjects revealed significant differences between responders (>50% decrease in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale total score) and nonresponders; only responders showed a significant increase in gray matter volume in the prefrontal cortex (p = .003) and an increase at trend level in the left subgenual prefrontal cortex volume (p = .0786). CONCLUSION: The increase in gray matter volume in these areas, which various neuroimaging and postmortem neuropathology studies have implicated in the neuropathophysiology of bipolar disorder, suggests that the observed effects may be linked to clinical response. The findings also support the notion that future treatments that more directly target molecules in critical central nervous system pathways that regulate cellular plasticity hold promise as novel, improved, long-term treatments for mood disorders as well as some neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of long-term use of lithium among older adults with BD and MDD. METHOD: Data from the Cohort of individuals with Schizophrenia and mood disorders Aged 55 years or more (CSA) were used. Two groups of patients with BD and MDD were compared: those who were currently receiving lithium versus those who were not. The effects of lithium on psychiatric (i.e., depressive symptoms severity, perceived clinical severity, rates of psychiatric admissions in the past-year), geriatric (overall and cognitive functioning) and physical outcomes (i.e., rates of non-psychiatric medical comorbidities and general hospital admissions in the past-year) were evaluated. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, duration of disorder, diagnosis, smoking status, alcohol use, and use of antipsychotics, antiepileptics or antidepressants. RESULTS: Among the 281 older participants with BD or MDD, 15.7% were taking lithium for a mean duration of 12.5(SD = 11.6) years. Lithium use was associated with lower intensity of depressive symptoms, reduced perceived clinical global severity and lower benzodiazepine use (all p < 0.05), without being linked to greater rates of medical comorbidities, except for hypothyroidism. LIMITATIONS: Data were cross-sectional and data on lifetime history of psychotropic medications was not assessed. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that long-term lithium use may be efficient and relatively well-tolerated in older adults with BD or treatment-resistant MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Morlet E ; Costemale-Lacoste JF ; Poulet E ; McMahon K ; Hoertel N ; Limosin F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2019.08.056 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAging/drug effects\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nBenzodiazepines/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nComorbidity\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHospitalization/statistics & numerical data\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nEffectiveness\r\nLithium\r\nLong-term\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nOlder adults\r\nTolerability","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Morlet E, Costemale-Lacoste JF, Poulet E, McMahon K, Hoertel N, and Limosin F (2019) Psychiatric and physical outcomes of long-term use of lithium in older adults with bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder: A cross-sectional multicenter study..

RECENT FINDINGS: Data show that treatment using dietary and parenteral zinc supplementation can reduce TBI-associated depression and improve cognitive function, specifically spatial learning and memory. However, excessive release of free zinc, particularly in the hippocampus associated with acute injury, can lead to increases in protein ubiquitination and neuronal death. SUMMARY: This work shows the need for future research to clarify the potentially contradictory roles of zinc in the hippocampus and define the clinical use of zinc as a treatment following brain injury in humans. This is particularly important given the finding that zinc may reduce TBI-associated depression, a common and difficult outcome to treat in all forms of TBI.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Morris DR ; Levenson CW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/MCO.0b013e328364f39c ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrain Injuries/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nCell Death/drug effects\r\nCognition/drug effects\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nNeurons/cytology/drug effects\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects\r\nNeurotoxicity Syndromes/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nZinc/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Morris DR, and Levenson CW (2013) Zinc in traumatic brain injury: from neuroprotection to neurotoxicity..

Lithium is a neuroprotective agent in use clinically for the management of manic-depressive and other neurodegenerative disorders. This study investigated the protective effect of lithium on MPH-induced oxidative stress, anxiety, depression and cognition impairment. Forty-eight adult male rats were divided randomly and equally into 6 groups. Treatment groups were received MPH (10mg/kg) and various doses of lithium (75, 150 and 300mg/kg) simultaneously and also lithium (150mg/kg) alone for 21 days. Elevated Plus Maze and Forced Swim Test were used to determine the level of anxiety and depression in animals. Morris Water Maze was used to evaluate spatial learning and memory. The hippocampi of rats were isolated and the level and activity of oxidative, anti-oxidant and inflammatory factors were measured. Also brain derived neurotropic factor expression level was measured by RT-PCR and western blotting. MPH (10mg/kg) caused behaviors indicative of anxiety and depression-like phenotypes in EPM and FST and cognition impairment in MWM. While lithium in all mentioned doses inhibited these effects. Treatment with MPH significantly increased lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial GSH content and IL-1β and TNF-α levels in isolated hippocampal cells. Moreover superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities and BDNF expression remarkably decreased. Various doses of lithium attenuated these effects and significantly mitigated MPH-induced oxidative damage, inflammation and increased BDNF expression level. Lithium has the potential to act as a neuroprotective agent against MPH induced toxicity in rat brain and this might be mediated by BDNF expression in hippocampus of rats.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Motaghinejad M ; Seyedjavadein Z ; Motevalian M ; Asadi M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuro.2016.06.010 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/*metabolism\r\nCentral Nervous System Stimulants/toxicity\r\nCytokines/metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nGlutathione Peroxidase/metabolism\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/*metabolism\r\nLipid Peroxidation/drug effects\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMaze Learning/drug effects\r\nMethylphenidate/*toxicity\r\n*Mood Disorders/chemically induced/pathology/prevention & control\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nOxidative Stress/*drug effects\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSuperoxide Dismutase/metabolism\r\nSwimming/psychology\r\nAnti-oxidant\r\nAnxiety\r\nBDNF\r\nCognition impairment\r\nDepression\r\nInflammatory factors\r\nLithium\r\nMethylphenidate\r\nNeurodegeneration","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Motaghinejad M, Seyedjavadein Z, Motevalian M, and Asadi M (2016) The neuroprotective effect of lithium against high dose methylphenidate: Possible role of BDNF..

During the last decade, animal data have provided considerable evidence that chronic administration of lithium within a \"therapeutic range\" induces 5-HT agonistic effects in the brain. Among other possible reasons this may be due to increased synthesis of 5-HT. After presenting the main animal data in this area, some recent findings in lithium-treated patients are reviewed supporting the biochemical and neurophysiological results. Taking into account that, firstly, lithium possesses antiaggressive effects in animals and men, and secondly, that (auto-)aggression seems to be related to a low concentration of 5-HIAA in CSF, and thirdly, that a close relationship exists between depression and aggressive behavior, the proof of 5-HT agonistic effects in humans may enable us to formulate an integrative theory on the mode of action of lithium salts.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Müller-Oerlinghausen B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1055/s-2007-1017367 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nBrain/*drug effects\r\nFenfluramine\r\nHumans\r\nHydrocortisone/blood\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nLong-Term Care\r\nProlactin/blood\r\nRats\r\nReceptors, Serotonin/*drug effects\r\nSerotonin/*metabolism\r\nSynaptosomes/drug effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Müller-Oerlinghausen B (1985) Lithium long-term treatment--does it act via serotonin?.

The lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder is 1.3 to 1.6%. The mortality rate of the disease is two to three times higher than that of the general population. About 10-20% of individuals with bipolar disorder take their own life, and nearly one third of patients admit to at least one suicide attempt. The clinical manifestations of the disease are exceptionally diverse. They range from mild hypomania or mild depression to severe forms of mania or depression accompanied by profound psychosis. Bipolar disorder is equally prevalent across sexes, with the exception of rapid cycling, a severe and difficult to treat variant of the disorder, which arises mostly in women. Because of the high risk of recurrence and suicide, long-term prophylactic pharmacological treatment is indicated. Lithium salts are the first choice long-term preventive treatment for bipolar disorder. They also possess well documented antisuicidal effects.

Lithium has the largest body of data to support its continued use as a prophylactic agent; however, most of this data comes from early studies that did not use contemporary analytic methods. Alternatives to lithium are needed because of the relatively high rate of non-response to lithium monotherapy and the drug's frequent side-effects. This article reviews available data with an emphasis on double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that examine the efficacy of lithium and other putative mood stabilizers: carbamazepine, divalproex, lamotrigine and olanzapine. METHOD: The authors reviewed key literature using Medline searches using key words: bipolar disorder, controlled trials, mood stabilizer, lithium, lomotrigine, divalproex, olanzapine, carbamazepine. RESULTS: Lithium remains the gold standard for overall preventative efficacy in bipolar disorder, especially to decrease manic or hypomanic relapse. Of the mood stabilizers that have marked prophylactic antimanic properties, lithium appears to possess the greatest antidepressant effect. Divalproex may also prevent recurrent bipolar mood episodes but the relative lack of controlled maintenance studies makes this less certain. There now exists an extensive and well-designed research database supporting the use of lamotrigine in the acute and prophylactic management of bipolar I disorder. Lamotrigine offers a spectrum of clinical effectiveness that complements lithium, in that it appears to stabilize mood 'from below baseline' by preventing episodes of depression and has been shown to be effective in rapid-cycling bipolar II disorder. Carbamazepine may be a useful alternative to lithium, divalproex and lamotrigine, particularly for patients with a history of mood-incongruent delusions and other comorbidities, but controlled data is more equivocal and it may lose some of its prophylactic effect over time. Emerging data continue to support the growing use of atypical antipsychotics, particularly olanzapine. CONCLUSIONS: Any monotherapy for use as a maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder appears to be inadequate for long-term use in the management of the majority of patients with bipolar disorder. Combination therapy has become the standard of care in the treatment of bipolar disorder and particularly in patients with treatment-refractory variants such as those with rapid-cycling. The emerging consensus is that patients on monotherapy, if followed for sufficiently long periods, will eventually require concomitant treatment to maintain a full remission. There exists a need for controlled trials that use random assignment to parallel arms including combination therapy followed by data analyses that include both relapse rate and survival techniques.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Muzina DJ ; Calabrese JR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/j.1440-1614.2005.01649.x ","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Muzina DJ, and Calabrese JR (2005) Maintenance therapies in bipolar disorder: focus on randomized controlled trials..

Lactoferrin, an innate metal-transport protein, synthesized in the substantia nigra, particularly in dopaminergic neurons and activated microglia is vital for brain physiology. Lactoferrin rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier via receptor-mediated transcytosis and accumulates in the brain capillary endothelial cells. Lactoferrin receptors are additionally present on glioma cells, brain micro-vessels, and neurons. As a regulator of neuro-redox, microglial lactoferrin is critical for protection/repair of neurons and healthy brain function. Iron imbalance and oxidative stress are common among patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, depression, and multiple sclerosis. As an endogenous iron-chelator, lactoferrin prevents iron accumulation and dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease patients. Oral lactoferrin supplementation could modulate the p-Akt/PTEN pathway, reduce Aβ deposition, and ameliorate cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Novel lactoferrin-based nano-therapeutics have emerged as effective drug-delivery systems for clinical management of neurodegenerative disorders. Recent emergence of the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, initially considered a respiratory illness, demonstrated a broader virulence spectrum with the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and inflict a plethora of neuropathological manifestations in the brain - the Neuro-COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are widely reported in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and multiple sclerosis patients with aggravated clinical outcomes. Lactoferrin, credited with several neuroprotective benefits in the brain could serve as a potential adjuvant in the clinical management of Neuro-COVID-19.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Naidu SAG ; Wallace TC ; Davies KJA ; Naidu AS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/19390211.2021.1922567 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nBlood-Brain Barrier/metabolism\r\n*Parkinson Disease\r\nLactoferrin/metabolism/therapeutic use\r\n*Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\n*Alzheimer Disease/drug therapy\r\nMental Health\r\nEndothelial Cells/metabolism\r\n*COVID-19\r\nSARS-CoV-2/metabolism\r\nIron/metabolism/therapeutic use\r\n*Neurodegenerative Diseases/drug therapy\r\nOxidation-Reduction\r\nAlzheimer’s disease\r\nCOVID-19\r\nLactoferrin\r\nNeuro-COVID-19\r\nParkinson’s Disease\r\nRedox\r\nSARS-CoV-2\r\nblood-brain barrier\r\nbrain tumor\r\nmental health\r\nneurological symptoms","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Naidu SAG, Wallace TC, Davies KJA, and Naidu AS (2023) Lactoferrin for Mental Health: Neuro-Redox Regulation and Neuroprotective Effects across the Blood-Brain Barrier with Special Reference to Neuro-COVID-19..

Changes in clinical outcomes over 6 weeks were measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). Quality of life was measured by the Lehman Brief Quality of Life Interview (QLI). RESULTS: Patients treated with olanzapine added to mood stabilizers, experienced significantly greater mean clinical improvements from baseline on both the Y-MRS and the HAM-D compared to those treated with placebo added to mood stabilizers. Over 6 weeks, patients treated with olanzapine added to mood stabilizers had significantly greater mean improvements from baseline on five of the nine subjective scales on the QLI, compared to patients treated with placebo added to mood stabilizers. Changes in scores on the subjective scales of the QLI were more strongly correlated to changes in depressive symptomatology measured by the HAM-D, than to changes in symptoms of mania measured by the Y-MRS.

In general, older people are more sensitive than young people to both the therapeutic and toxic effects of psychotropic medications, necessitating lower doses and longer dosage intervals. This holds true for the treatment of 5 major types of psychiatric illness (depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, psychotic disorders and dementia). The tricyclic antidepressants, although efficacious, inexpensive, and backed by 30 years of experience, are less well tolerated by the elderly than are newer antidepressants such as the selective serotonin uptake inhibitors. Problems with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, including orthostatic hypotension and restrictions in diet and other medication use, have been overcome by the advent of reversible selective inhibitors of MAO-A, but the efficacy of these in the elderly has yet to be proven in clinical trials. Lithium remains the mainstay for the treatment of bipolar disorder. However, careful dosing and monitoring of plasma lithium concentrations are required in the elderly due to changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics which make older patients very sensitive to the toxic effects of this medication. Similarly, age-related changes in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the benzodiazepines, the most frequently prescribed medications for anxiety in the elderly, result in recommendations for lower doses and preferential use of those agents metabolised by conjugation (e.g. oxazepam). Buspirone, a partial serotonin 5-HT1A-agonist which is better tolerated than benzodiazepines in the elderly, may be used as an alternative. The elderly are extremely sensitive to extrapyramidal adverse effects which the typical antipsychotics (neuroleptics) exhibit to varying extents. The selection of a suitable agent for the treatment of a psychotic disorder should be based upon the adverse effect profile of the drug and the specific symptoms and situation of the patient. The newer atypical antipsychotics, clozapine and risperidone, have yet to be well-studied in the elderly. Dementia, exemplified by Alzheimer's disease, is almost exclusively an illness of the elderly. Only one medication, tacrine, has been approved for its treatment, based on extensive basic research and positive results of several clinical trials. Its long-term benefits have yet to be determined and it has several adverse effects, including a tendency to increase liver enzymes to the extent that the medication has to be discontinued.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Naranjo CA ; Herrmann N ; Mittmann N ; Bremner KE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2165/00002512-199507030-00004 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAging/*metabolism\r\nGeriatric Psychiatry\r\nHumans\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Naranjo CA, Herrmann N, Mittmann N, and Bremner KE (1995) Recent advances in geriatric psychopharmacology..

This disease has negative impacts on quality of life and psychological-related functions. This is a multifactorial disorder; both genetic background and environmental factors have their role. Antidepressants are prescribed as the first line of treatment for patients with depressive disorders. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are used to treat MDD and anxiety; however, some patients do not respond to them. Regarding that, magnesium plays a major role in mood regulation; therefore, this study aimed to investigate the role of magnesium supplement in patients with MDD and under an SSRI treatment regimen. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind controlled trial, 60 patients with major depressive disorders based on the DSM-V diagnosis referred to Golestan Hospital in Ahvaz, Iran, were included. The eligible patients were categorized randomly into two thirty-people groups receiving magnesium (intervention) and placebo (control) along with SSRI for 6 weeks. To evaluate the depression status, the Beck II test was applied. Subjects were examined before and after the intervention. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of demographic characteristics (P > 0.05). The mean Beck scores at the beginning of the study and the second week after the intervention were not different between the two groups (P = 0.97, P = 0.56), whereas the mean Beck scores were lower in the intervention group than in the control group in the fourth and sixth weeks after the intervention (P = 0.02 and P = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Administration of Mg supplement for at least 6 weeks might improve depression symptoms. It can also be considered as a potential adjunct treatment option for MDD patients who are under SSRI treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nazarinasab M ; Behrouzian F ; Abdi L ; Sadegh Moghaddam AA; Sadeghi S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1164_22 ","Keywords":"Magnesium supplement\r\nmajor depression disorder (MDD)\r\nmultifactorial disorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nazarinasab M, Behrouzian F, Abdi L, Sadegh Moghaddam AA, and Sadeghi S (2022) Investigating the effect of magnesium supplement in patients with major depressive disorder under selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment..

Randomized controlled trials supported its efficacy but most trials added lithium to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Despite its efficacy, use of lithium augmentation remains infrequent. The current systematic review and meta-analysis examines the efficacy of lithium augmentation as an adjunct to second generation antidepressants as well as to TCAs and considers reasons for its infrequent use. METHOD: A systematic search of Medline and the Cochrane Clinical Trials database was performed. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials of lithium augmentation were selected. A fixed-effects meta-analysis was performed. Odds ratios for response were calculated for each treatment-control contrast, for the trials grouped by type of initial antidepressant (TCA or second generation antidepressant), and as a meta-analytic summary for all treatments combined. RESULTS: Nine trials that included 237 patients were selected. The odds ratio for response to lithium vs. placebo in all contrasts combined was 2.89 (95% CI 1.65, 5.05, z=3.72, p=0.0002). Heterogeneity was very low, I(2)=0%. Adjunctive lithium was effective with TCAs (7 contrasts) and with second generation agents (3 contrasts). Discontinuation due to adverse events was infrequent and did not differ between lithium and placebo.

Treatment nonresponse is usually defined as persistence of depression after 6 weeks of adequate doses as shown by plasma concentrations of antidepressant medication. After the clinician has reassessed the patient and, in particular, the diagnosis of major depression, two major options are available: (1) taper the current antidepressant and initiate a trial of an unrelated antidepressant or (2) potentiate the antidepressant effects of the current antidepressant and initiate a trial of an unrelated antidepressant or (2) potentiate the antidepressant effects of the current antidepressant with either thyroid hormone, usually T3, or lithium. This paper describes in detail the usefulness of these two adjuncts in potentiating the effects of antidepressants and in converting antidepressant medication nonresponders to responders. Other augmentation strategies are also briefly described, including the concurrent use of two antidepressants from different drug classes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nemeroff CB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepressive Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nPatient Compliance\r\nTriiodothyronine/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nemeroff CB (1991) Augmentation regimens for depression..

This article addresses the treatment of patients with bipolar mania, which remains one of the most difficult challenges facing clinicians. Patients require safe and effective therapeutic approaches for acute episodes of mania and depression, as well as chronic prophylaxis against future episodes. Monotherapeutic approaches are rarely effective, and combination approaches are associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Lithium is the only agent currently approved for the treatment of both acute episodes of mania and maintenance therapy; however, it is associated with a relatively poor response rate, high relapse rate, and less-than-optimal side effect profile. Other recent approaches have included several anticonvulsant agents, as well as conventional and atypical antipsychotic agents.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nemeroff CB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Acetates/therapeutic use\r\n*Amines\r\nAnticonvulsants/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBenzodiazepines\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/prevention & control/psychology\r\nCarbamazepine/therapeutic use\r\nClozapine/therapeutic use\r\n*Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nElectromagnetic Phenomena\r\nFructose/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use\r\nGabapentin\r\nHumans\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nOlanzapine\r\nPirenzepine/*analogs & derivatives\r\nRisperidone/therapeutic use\r\nTopiramate\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nTriazines/therapeutic use\r\nValproic Acid/therapeutic use\r\n*gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nemeroff CB (2000) An ever-increasing pharmacopoeia for the management of patients with bipolar disorder..

The results indicate that these patients showed a consistent syndrome with the following features: a) anergic endogenous depression; b) positive family history in first degree probands; c) obsessional personality traits and symptoms; d) hypochondriasis and somatic symptoms; e) failure to respond to previous antidepressant therapy with tricyclic and MAOI compounds as well as ECT. A previous study by Gittleson showed that one third of a series of psychotic depressives admitted to the Maudsley Hospital, London, also displayed obsessional symptoms and hypochondriasis. These patients, however, seemed to do as well with standard antidepressant treatment as a control group of psychotic depressives without obsessional features. However, in this series, there was a 7 per cent residue whose obsessional symptoms worsened, even after recovery from their depression. The authors' group of patients represented approximately 3 per cent of all psychotic depressives seen over the 4-year period and could, therefore, coincide with Gittleson's residue. The mean age of onset of illness in the authors' depressive group was 45.5 years, and this finding, coupled with the high incidence of psychotic depression in first degree relatives, indicates that these patients were suffering from a psychotic depression modified by personality traits, rather than an atypical obsessional neurosis. The consistency of clinical features and specificity of response to lithium therapy appear to indicate that this is a clearly definable clinical syndrome worthy of further investigation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Neubauer H ; Bermingham P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00005053-197610000-00007 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAnxiety/complications\r\nDepression/complications/*drug therapy/genetics\r\nHumans\r\nHypochondriasis/complications\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nSleep Wake Disorders/complications\r\nSyndrome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Neubauer H, and Bermingham P (1976) A depressive syndrome responsive to lithium.

This paper examined the effects of preconceptional micronutrient supplementation on MDS during pregnancy and postpartum. METHODS: We used data from a double-blind controlled trial (PRECONCEPT) in which 5011 Vietnamese women were randomized to receive weekly supplements containing either a) multiple micronutrients (MM) b) iron and folic acid (IFA) or c) folic acid (FA) until conception (n = 1813). Maternal mental health was assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) at baseline (preconception), and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during pregnancy and 3 months postpartum. Elevated MDS was defined as EPDS score ≥ 4. All group comparisons were done using ANOVA or chi-square tests of proportions intention to treat and per protocol analyses (women consumed supplements ≥26 weeks before conception). We also conducted stratified analyses by preconception CES-D scores, underweight, or anemia status using generalized linear models. RESULTS: Baseline CES-D scores were similar across treatment groups. The proportion of women experiencing elevated MDS was 11.3, 8.1 and 4.9% at first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy, respectively, and 3.6% at 3 mo postpartum. Mean EPDS scores at first (1.5 ± 2.7), second (1.1 ± 2.4), and third trimester of pregnancy (0.7 ± 2.0) and early postpartum (0.6 ± 1.8) were low and did not differ by treatment group. However, among women in the highest tertile of CES-D scores at preconception, mean EPDS scores in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy were lower in the MM and IFA groups compared to FA only (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Weekly preconceptional micronutrient supplements containing iron did not improve depression measures relative to folic acid alone among all women, but may have benefitted women who were at risk for depression. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered retrospectively at ClinicalTrials.Gov as NCT01665378 on August 13, 2012.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nguyen PH ; DiGirolamo AM ; Gonzalez-Casanova I ; Pham H ; Hao W ; Nguyen H ; Truong TV ; Nguyen S ; Harding KB ; Reinhart GA ; Martorell R ; Ramakrishnan U ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12905-017-0401-3 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nMicronutrients/*administration & dosage\r\nPostpartum Period/*psychology\r\nPreconception Care/*methods\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/*psychology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVietnam\r\nVitamin B Complex/administration & dosage\r\nYoung Adult\r\nMental health\r\nMultiple micronutrient\r\nPreconception\r\nRandomized controlled trial\r\nSupplement\r\nVietnam\r\nWomen of reproductive age","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nguyen PH, DiGirolamo AM, Gonzalez-Casanova I, Pham H, Hao W, Nguyen H, Truong TV, Nguyen S, Harding KB, Reinhart GA, Martorell R, and Ramakrishnan U (2017) Impact of preconceptional micronutrient supplementation on maternal mental health during pregnancy and postpartum: results from a randomized controlled trial in Vietnam..

Recent studies have shown that ketamine may increase the potential risk of treatment-induced mania in patients. Ketamine has also been applied to establish animal models of mania. At present, however, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In the current study, we found that chronic lithium exposure attenuated ketamine-induced mania-like behavior and c-Fos expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of adult male mice. Transcriptome sequencing was performed to determine the effect of lithium administration on the transcriptome of the PFC in ketamine-treated mice, showing inactivation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of AKT signaling by MK2206 (40 mg/kg), a selective AKT inhibitor, reversed ketamine-induced mania. Furthermore, selective knockdown of AKT via AAV-AKT-shRNA-EGFP in the mPFC also reversed ketamine-induced mania-like behavior. Importantly, pharmacological activation of AKT signaling by SC79 (40 mg/kg), an AKT activator, contributed to mania in low-dose ketamine-treated mice. Inhibition of PI3K signaling by LY294002 (25 mg/kg), a specific PI3K inhibitor, reversed the mania-like behavior in ketamine-treated mice. However, pharmacological inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling with rapamycin (10 mg/kg), a specific mTOR inhibitor, had no effect on ketamine-induced mania-like behavior. These results suggest that chronic lithium treatment ameliorates ketamine-induced mania-like behavior via the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which may be a novel target for the development of BD treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ni RJ ; Gao TH ; Wang YY ; Tian Y ; Wei JX ; Zhao LS ; Ni PY ; Ma XH ; Li T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2022.278 ","Keywords":"Male\r\nMice\r\nAnimals\r\n*Ketamine/toxicity\r\nPhosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology\r\nProto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology\r\nLithium/pharmacology\r\nMania\r\nPhosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major\r\nRNA, Small Interfering\r\nTOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics\r\nSignal Transduction\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use/pharmacology\r\nSirolimus/pharmacology\r\nLithium Compounds/pharmacology\r\nMammals\r\n*Rodent Diseases/drug therapy\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nKetamine\r\nLithium\r\nManic\r\nMedial prefrontal cortex\r\nPI3K-AKT signaling pathway","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ni RJ, Gao TH, Wang YY, Tian Y, Wei JX, Zhao LS, Ni PY, Ma XH, and Li T (2022) Chronic lithium treatment ameliorates ketamine-induced mania-like behavior via the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway..

This study compared the effectiveness of lithium versus triiodothyronine (T(3)) augmentation as a third-step treatment for patients with major depressive disorder. METHOD: A total of 142 adult outpatients with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder who had not achieved remission or who were intolerant to an initial prospective treatment with citalopram and a second switch or augmentation trial were randomly assigned to augmentation with lithium (up to 900 mg/day; N=69) or with T(3) (up to 50 mug/day; N=73) for up to 14 weeks. The primary outcome measure was whether participants achieved remission, which was defined as a score < or =7 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS: After a mean of 9.6 weeks (SD=5.2) of treatment, remission rates were 15.9% with lithium augmentation and 24.7% with T(3) augmentation, although the difference between treatments was not statistically significant. Lithium was more frequently associated with side effects (p=0.045), and more participants in the lithium group left treatment because of side effects (23.2% versus 9.6%; p=0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Remission rates with lithium and T(3) augmentation for participants who experienced unsatisfactory results with two prior medication treatments were modest and did not differ significantly. The lower side effect burden and ease of use of T(3) augmentation suggest that it has slight advantages over lithium augmentation for depressed patients who have experienced several failed medication trials.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nierenberg AA ; Fava M ; Trivedi MH ; Wisniewski SR ; Thase ME ; McGrath PJ ; Alpert JE ; Warden D ; Luther JF ; Niederehe G ; Lebowitz B ; Shores-Wilson K ; Rush AJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/ajp.2006.163.9.1519 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAmbulatory Care\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nProbability\r\nProspective Studies\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales/statistics & numerical data\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nTriiodothyronine/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nierenberg AA, Fava M, Trivedi MH, Wisniewski SR, Thase ME, McGrath PJ, Alpert JE, Warden D, Luther JF, Niederehe G, Lebowitz B, Shores-Wilson K, and Rush AJ (2006) A comparison of lithium and T(3) augmentation following two failed medication treatments for depression: a STAR*D report..

Chronic exposure to progesterone during pregnancy and its withdrawal following delivery increases depression and anxiety. In addition, there are complex interactions between hormones, neurotransmitters, and trace elements. Zinc (Zn) and magnesium (Mg) influence the nervous system by impacting synaptic neurotransmission in the brain. Thiamine (Vit B1) deficiency results in a high percentage of depressive behaviors. Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species in pregnancy are implicated in the pathogenesis of major depression. METHODS: We examined the effects of different combinations of Zn, Mg, and Vit B1 in an animal model of PPD. ZnCl, MgCl, and thiamine-HCl were administered to PPD-induced mice. Depression, anxiety-related behavior, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were assessed. Depression and anxiety-like behavior were evaluated by the forced swimming test (FST) and elevated plus-maze, respectively. RESULTS: The acute combined administration of Zn, Mg, and Vit B1 significantly decreased immobility time in FST, increased the percentage of both time spent in- and entries to open arms in the elevated plus-maze, and augmented TAC. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that acute administration of combined treatment with Zn, Mg, and Vit B1 on postpartum day 3 improves depressive symptoms and anxiety-like behaviors. Our evaluation of TAC is in accordance with behavioral results.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nikseresht S ; Etebary S ; Karimian M ; Nabavizadeh F ; Zarrindast MR ; Sadeghipour HR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnxiety\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nDepression\r\n*Depression, Postpartum\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMagnesium\r\nMaze Learning/drug effects\r\nMice\r\nThiamine\r\n*Zinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nikseresht S, Etebary S, Karimian M, Nabavizadeh F, Zarrindast MR, and Sadeghipour HR (2012) Acute administration of Zn, Mg, and thiamine improves postpartum depression conditions in mice..

METHODS: Patients with bipolar manic or mixed episode (DSM-IV criteria) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score> or =20 at screening received olanzapine (5-20 mg/day, n=69) or lithium carbonate (600-1800 mg/day, n=71) for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was mean change from baseline in Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar Version Overall Severity of Illness (CGI-BP) score. Secondary efficacy measures included YMRS, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: A significantly greater mean change was observed in olanzapine versus lithium patients in CGI-BP (Overall Severity) (P=0.009), YMRS (P=0.013), BPRS (P=0.032), and CGI-BP (Severity of Mania) (P=0.012) scores. More olanzapine than lithium patients experienced at least one adverse event possibly related to study drug (P=0.038). More olanzapine patients had a clinically significant weight increase (> or =7% of baseline weight) compared to lithium patients (P=0.009). More olanzapine patients completed the study than lithium patients, although this difference was not statistically significant (olz, 91.3%; lith, 78.9%; P=0.057). LIMITATIONS: No placebo arm was included; however both treatments have previously been reported to be more effective than placebo. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that olanzapine has superior efficacy to lithium in the acute treatment of patients with bipolar mania over a 4-week period. However, adverse events were experienced by a greater number of olanzapine patients than lithium patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Niufan G ; Tohen M ; Qiuqing A ; Fude Y ; Pope E ; McElroy H ; Ming L ; Gaohua W ; Xinbao Z ; Huichun L ; Liang S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2007.04.020 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBasal Ganglia Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology\r\nBenzodiazepines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/complications/*drug therapy\r\nBrief Psychiatric Rating Scale\r\nDepressive Disorder/complications/diagnosis\r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nObesity/chemically induced/epidemiology\r\nOlanzapine\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nWeight Gain/drug effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Niufan G, Tohen M, Qiuqing A, Fude Y, Pope E, McElroy H, Ming L, Gaohua W, Xinbao Z, Huichun L, and Liang S (2008) Olanzapine versus lithium in the acute treatment of bipolar mania: a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial..

Despite its worldwide clinical use, the effectiveness of lithium has been questioned. The aim of this work is to critically review the available data on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning long-term lithium treatment. METHODS: A systematic search for long-term treatment RCTs with at least 6 months of follow-up was performed. Six RCTs enrolling 1,561 bipolar I and II patients of adult and pediatric age, randomizing 534 to lithium, were identified. All studies are controlled trials sponsored by industry, investigating new treatments for BD, with lithium as an active comparator, and therefore not specifically designed to study lithium efficacy or safety. RESULTS: RESULTS from earliest studies suggest a high effectiveness of lithium against both mania and depression, while more recent studies highlight lithium as more effective than placebo in mania and hypomania, without significant evidence in depression. Lithium does not achieve significant differences in efficacy when compared with divalproex; it seems less effective than lamotrigine in preventing depression and less effective than olanzapine in manic and mixed episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a number of methodological issues (enriched designs, unbalanced samples, potential inclusion of lithium nonresponders in some studies), lithium appears to have a clear antimanic prophylactic activity and some efficacy in the prevention of depression. Lithium should still have a major role in the long-term treatment of BD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nivoli AM ; Murru A ; Vieta E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000314307 ","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTime Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nivoli AM, Murru A, and Vieta E (2010) Lithium: still a cornerstone in the long-term treatment in bipolar disorder?.

The mechanism by which combining magnesium and vitamin B6 leads to reduced stress in these subjects remains to be elucidated. This secondary analysis investigated the impact of magnesium and vitamin B6 supplementation and perceived stress on erythrocyte magnesium levels, as a marker of body magnesium status. This was a secondary analysis from an 8-week randomized controlled trial comparing oral magnesium (300 mg) and magnesium-vitamin B6 (300 mg + 30 mg) supplementation. Stress level and erythrocyte magnesium level at baseline, and change in erythrocyte magnesium and serum vitamin B6 levels at weeks 4 and 8, were analyzed. Overall, 264 subjects were randomized to treatment and had evaluable Depression Anxiety Stress Scale scores (132 in each treatment arm). At baseline, stress scores, and mean serum magnesium, erythrocyte magnesium, and serum vitamin B6 concentrations were similar between arms. Although not significant between groups, a significant increase over time in erythrocyte magnesium levels was observed in the subgroup of subjects with low baseline erythrocyte magnesium levels (<1.6 mmol/L) following treatment with magnesium and magnesium-vitamin B6 (week 4:0.21 mmol/L [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.10 to 0.31], p = 0.0003; and 0.13 mmol/L [95% CI, 0.02 to 0.23], p = 0.0233, respectively). Change from baseline in circulating vitamin B6 levels at weeks 4 and 8 in the magnesium-vitamin B6 supplemented group (314.96 nmol/L [95%CI, 294.61 to 335.31]) was significantly different (p < 0.0001) compared with the magnesium supplemented group (-0.39 nmol/L [95% CI, -20.73 to 19.94]). Magnesium alone and magnesium-vitamin B6 provided statistically significant increases in erythrocyte magnesium in subjects with low magnesium status (<1.6mmol/L). Vitamin B6 supplementation did not further increase magnesium levels.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Noah L ; Pickering G ; Mazur A ; Dubray C ; Hitier S ; Dualé C ; Pouteau E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1684/mrh.2020.0468 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\nMagnesium/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nVitamin B 6/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics\r\nYoung Adult\r\nbiomarkers of magnesium status\r\nmagnesium supplementation\r\nperceived stress\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nvitamin B6 supplementation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Noah L, Pickering G, Mazur A, Dubray C, Hitier S, Dualé C, and Pouteau E (2020) Impact of magnesium supplementation, in combination with vitamin B6, on stress and magnesium status: secondary data from a randomized controlled trial..

There are indications but no proof for efficacy of mood stabilizers such as lithium, carbamazepine and valproate. Only lamotrigine has been shown to be effective, with a relative low risk of switching. Several antidepressants appear effective as well, but again there is no (placebo-controlled) proof of their efficacy. The only exception is tranylcypromine which has been found to be more effective than imipramine. The switch ratio into (hypo)mania by tricyclic antidepressants seems to be higher than by several other antidepressants, especially the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. In the acute treatment of bipolar depression, it is recommended to start with a mood stabilizer, and to add an antidepressant after 4-6 weeks in case of nonresponse. In severer cases, one might consider to start earlier with the combination of a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant, and in refractory patients, there is a place for tranylcypromine. In the maintenance treatment, there are indications that the combined treatment of a mood stabilizer (mostly lithium) and an antidepressant (TCA) is associated with an increased risk of switches into (hypo)mania, when compared to a mood stabilizer alone. Therefore, it is recommended to try whether a monotherapy with a mood stabilizer is effective, before combining it with an antidepressant.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nolen WA ; Bloemkolk D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000054845 ","Keywords":"*Algorithms\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nolen WA, and Bloemkolk D (2000) Treatment of bipolar depression, a review of the literature and a suggestion for an algorithm..

In general, unipolar depression is connected with low blood zinc levels that are increased by effective antidepressant therapy. A placebo-controlled, double blind pilot study of zinc supplementation in antidepressant therapy was conducted in patients who fulfilled DSM IV criteria for major (unipolar) depression. Patients received zinc supplementation (6 patients; 25 mg of Zn2+ once daily) or placebo (8 patients) and were treated with standard antidepressant therapy (tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to assess efficacy of antidepressant therapy, and patients' status was evaluated before the treatment and 2, 6 and 12 weeks after its commencement. Antidepressant treatment significantly reduced HDRS scores by the 2nd week of treatment in both groups, and lowered BDI scores at the 6th week in zinc-treated group. Zinc supplementation significantly reduced scores in both measures after 6- and 12-week supplementation when compared with placebo treatment. This preliminary study is the first demonstration of the benefit of zinc supplementation in antidepressant therapy. The mechanism(s) may be related to modulation of glutamatergic or immune systems by zinc ion.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nowak G ; Siwek M ; Dudek D ; Zieba A ; Pilc A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAmitriptyline/pharmacology\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nCitalopram/pharmacology\r\nClomipramine/pharmacology\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPilot Projects\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nZinc/administration & dosage/*pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nowak G, Siwek M, Dudek D, Zieba A, and Pilc A (2003) Effect of zinc supplementation on antidepressant therapy in unipolar depression: a preliminary placebo-controlled study..

Previously, we have demonstrated that acute administration of zinc sulfate is active in FST in rats and mice. In the present study, zinc hydroaspartate in a dose of 65 mg/kg (11.5 mgZn/kg), all: acute, sub-chronic and chronic administration, reduced the immobility time in the FST in rats. Removal of olfactory bulbs (OB surgery) in rats is associated with variety of behavioral abnormalities such as deficit in a step-down passive avoidance or hyperactivity in the \"open field\" test. Both acute and chronic administration of zinc hydroaspartate reduced the number of trials needed to the learning passive avoidance and reduced the OB-induced hyperactivity in rats. At the time schedule following zinc hydroaspartate administration, when behavioral experiments were performed, the serum zinc concentrations were significantly higher than control-physiological values. These results confirm activity of zinc in the FST, show its antidepressant-like activity in the OB rat model of depression, demonstrate the lack of tolerance to these effects and suggest relationship of these antidepressant-like effects with the rise in serum zinc. These animal data further suggest antidepressant activity of zinc in human depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nowak G ; Szewczyk B ; Wieronska JM ; Branski P ; Palucha A ; Pilc A ; Sadlik K ; Piekoszewski W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0361-9230(03)00104-7 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nAvoidance Learning/drug effects\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nDepression/blood/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Administration Schedule/veterinary\r\nExploratory Behavior/drug effects\r\nImmobilization\r\nMale\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nOlfactory Bulb/physiology/*surgery\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nReaction Time\r\nStress, Physiological/*drug therapy\r\nSwimming\r\nTime Factors\r\nZinc/blood/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nowak G, Szewczyk B, Wieronska JM, Branski P, Palucha A, Pilc A, Sadlik K, and Piekoszewski W (2003) Antidepressant-like effects of acute and chronic treatment with zinc in forced swim test and olfactory bulbectomy model in rats..

We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analyses (NMA) to combine direct and indirect comparisons of augmentation agents. METHODS: We included randomized controlled trials comparing one active drug with another or with placebo following a treatment course up to 24 weeks. Nineteen agents were included: stimulants, atypical antipsychotics, thyroid hormones, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers. Data for response/remission and all-cause discontinuation rates were analyzed. We estimated effect-size by relative risk using pairwise and NMA with random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 65 studies (N = 12,415) with 19 augmentation agents were included in the NMA. Our findings from the NMA for response rates, compared to placebo, were significant for: liothyronine, nortriptyline, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, quetiapine, lithium, modafinil, olanzapine (fluoxetine), cariprazine, and lisdexamfetamine. For remission rates, compared to placebo, were significant for: thyroid hormone(T4), aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, risperidone, quetiapine, and olanzapine (fluoxetine). Compared to placebo, ziprasidone, mirtazapine, and cariprazine had statistically significant higher discontinuation rates. Overall, 24% studies were rated as having low risk of bias (RoB), 63% had moderate RoB and 13% had high RoB. LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity in TRD definitions, variable trial duration and methodological clinical design of older studies and small number of trials per comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: This NMA suggests a superiority of the regulatory approved adjunctive atypical antipsychotics, thyroid hormones, dopamine compounds (modafinil and lisdexamfetamine) and lithium. Acceptability was lower with ziprasidone, mirtazapine, and cariprazine. Further research and head-to-head studies should be considered to strengthen the best available options for TRD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nuñez NA ; Joseph B ; Pahwa M ; Kumar R ; Resendez MG ; Prokop LJ ; Veldic M ; Seshadri A ; Biernacka JM ; Frye MA ; Wang Z ; Singh B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2021.12.134 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nNetwork Meta-Analysis\r\nEfficacy\r\nMood disorders\r\nNetwork Meta-analysis\r\nTreatment resistant\r\nUnipolar depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nuñez NA, Joseph B, Pahwa M, Kumar R, Resendez MG, Prokop LJ, Veldic M, Seshadri A, Biernacka JM, Frye MA, Wang Z, and Singh B (2022) Augmentation strategies for treatment resistant major depression: A systematic review and network meta-analysis..

It is also the preferred choice as maintenance treatment. Numerous studies have shown morphological abnormalities in the brains of BD patients, suggesting that this highly heritable disorder may exhibit progressive and deleterious changes in brain structure. Since treatment with Li(+) ameliorates these abnormalities, it has been postulated that Li(+) is a neuroprotective agent in the same way atypical antipsychotics are neuroprotective in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Li(+)'s neuroprotective properties are related to its modulation of nerve growth factors, inflammation, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and programmed cell death mechanisms such as autophagy and apoptosis. Notwithstanding, it is not known whether Li(+)-induced neuroprotection is related to the inhibition of its putative molecular targets in a BD episode: the enzymes inositol-monophosphatase, (IMPase), glycogen-synthase-kinase 3β (GSK3), and Protein kinase C (PKC). Furthermore, it is uncertain whether these neuroprotective mechanisms are correlated with Li(+)'s clinical efficacy in maintaining mood stability. It is expected that in a nearby future, precision medicine approaches will improve diagnosis and expand treatment options. This will certainly contribute to ameliorating the medical and economic burden created by this devastating mood disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ochoa ELM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s10571-021-01129-9 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*Antipsychotic Agents/pharmacology\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\n*Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nLithium\r\nNeuroprotection","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ochoa ELM (2022) Lithium as a Neuroprotective Agent for Bipolar Disorder: An Overview..

Lithium consistently decreases exploratory activity, rearing, aggression, and amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion; and it increases the sensitivity to pilocarpine-induced seizures, decreases immobility time in the forced swim test, and attenuates reserpine-induced hypolocomotion. Lithium also predictably induces conditioned taste aversion and alterations in circadian rhythms. The modulation of stereotypy, sensitization, and reward behavior are less consistent actions of the drug. These behavioral models may be relevant to human symptoms and to clinical endophenotypes. It is likely that the actions of lithium in a subset of these animal models are related to the therapeutic efficacy, as well the side effects, of the drug. We conclude with a brief discussion of various molecular mechanisms by which these lithium-sensitive behaviors may be mediated, and comment on the ways in which rat and mouse models can be used more effectively in the future to address persistent questions about the therapeutically relevant molecular actions of lithium.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"O'Donnell KC ; Gould TD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neubiorev.2007.04.002 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred Strains\r\nRats\r\nRats, Inbred Strains\r\nSpecies Specificity","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"O'Donnell KC, and Gould TD (2007) The behavioral actions of lithium in rodent models: leads to develop novel therapeutics..

The results showed that the reserpine injected rats had behavior phenotypes typical of depression-pain dyad and the (MeOPhSe)(2)-supplemented diet protected against these modifications. Furthermore, the (MeOPhSe)(2) dietary supplementation was effective against the increase in the prefrontal cortical MDA levels caused by reserpine. (MeOPhSe)(2)-supplemented diet triggered a per se augmentation of Nrf-2 levels. The [(3)H] serotonin uptake, [(3)H] glutamate uptake and release and MAO activity were not altered in the prefrontal cortices of rats from any experimental group. Therefore, the results indicate that protective effects of a (MeOPhSe)(2)-supplemented diet can be mediated, at least in part, by its antioxidant property.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Oliveira CES ; Marcondes Sari MHM; Zborowski VA ; Prado VC ; Nogueira CW ; Zeni G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.10.021 ","Keywords":"Analgesics/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBenzene Derivatives/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*complications/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nLocomotion/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nNeurochemistry\r\nOrganoselenium Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nOxidative Stress/drug effects\r\nPain/*complications/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nReserpine/*pharmacology\r\nAntioxidant\r\nOrganoselenium\r\nPain-depression dyad\r\nReserpine\r\nSelenium","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Oliveira CES, Marcondes Sari MHM, Zborowski VA, Prado VC, Nogueira CW, and Zeni G (2016) Pain-depression dyad induced by reserpine is relieved by p,p'-methoxyl-diphenyl diselenide in rats..

The results showed that repeated intragastric administration of (MeOPhSe)(2) (dose range: 0.1-5mg/kg), different from a single administration, reduced the immobility time in the mouse tail suspension test. A single administration of (MeOPhSe)(2) at a dose of 5mg/kg decreased the immobility time, increased the swimming time and did not alter the climbing behavior in the modified forced swimming test (mFST). Repeated administration of (MeOPhSe)(2) decreased the immobility time, did not alter the swimming time and increased the climbing behavior in the mouse mFST. Repeated administration of (MeOPhSe)(2) at a dose of 5mg/kg elicited a mouse anxiolytic-like phenotype in the elevated plus maze and light-dark tests.

Consequently, the precise mechanisms of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant drugs such as fluoxetine are being revisited. Zinc is a trace element that has been long implicated in the psychopathology and therapy of depression. Zinc has been found to be sequestered and dispensed during stress and inflammation through a family of proteins called metallothioneins (MTs). In addition, MTs are well known for their antioxidant and therefore cytoprotective action. Changes in MTs, their upstream regulators and downstream effectors in response to fluoxetine have not been yet studied. The aim of the present study is to examine whether depression-induced changes in protein levels and mRNA levels of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), MTs, antioxidant defensive enzyme heme oxygenase (HO-1), zinc-specific receptor GPR39 and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus can be reversed by fluoxetine treatment, zinc supplementation or a combination of the two. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present study investigated the effect of chronic (4weeks) combined treatment with zinc hydroaspartate (15mg/kg) and fluoxetine (10mg/kg) on a chronic mild stress model (CMS) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. RESULTS: Hippocampal mRNA and protein levels of Nrf2, HO-1, MTs, GPR39 (protein level only) and BDNF were significantly higher in response to a combined therapy of fluoxetine and zinc than to either monotherapy. Additionally, HO-1 and MTs gene expression was correlated with that of Nrf2 in the FLX-only group. CONCLUSION: Fluoxetine therapy activated the expression of MTs and HO-1 through an Nrf2-dependent pathway. When FLX was escorted by zinc, activated MTs had a positive impact on BDNF through the zinc signaling receptor GPR39, resulting in general improvement in neuronal plasticity as well as reduction of neuronal atrophy and neuronal cell loss.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Omar NN ; Tash RF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pbb.2017.08.003 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nBrain/metabolism\r\nChronic Disease\r\nCorticosterone/blood\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/pathology\r\n*Disease Models, Animal\r\nFluoxetine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nNeurons/*pathology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\n*Signal Transduction\r\n*Stress, Psychological\r\nSucrose/administration & dosage\r\nWeight Gain/drug effects\r\nZinc/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nCMS\r\nFluoxetine\r\nMetallothioneins\r\nNeuronal plasticity\r\nZinc\r\nZinc signaling","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Omar NN, and Tash RF (2017) Fluoxetine coupled with zinc in a chronic mild stress model of depression: Providing a reservoir for optimum zinc signaling and neuronal remodeling..

Although the treatment of bipolar depression remains an understudied area, new data from randomized, controlled trials and naturalistic studies have expanded the range of treatments available. The main aim in the treatment of bipolar depression is the prevention of the patient switching to mania and cycle acceleration, and antidepressant therapy may be contraindicated because of the risk for switching. Guidelines for the acute treatment of bipolar depression emphasize treatment with a mood stabilizer, of which lithium has been the most thoroughly studied in randomized, controlled trials in acute bipolar depression. Lamotrigine has also demonstrated significant efficacy in recent studies and has been approved by the FDA.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Oral ET ; Vahip S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Acute Disease\r\nAntidepressive Agents/classification/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/chemistry/classification/*therapeutic use\r\nBenzodiazepines/chemistry/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nChemoprevention\r\nContraindications\r\nDepressive Disorder/diagnosis/drug therapy\r\nDiagnosis, Differential\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nOlanzapine\r\nTriazines/chemistry/therapeutic use\r\nValproic Acid/chemistry/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Oral ET, and Vahip S (2004) Bipolar depression: an overview..

This is attributed to the fact that the precise pathophysiology of this ailment is unclear though a genetic factor is an essential element in etiology. Dissimilar to other serious psychiatric categories such as psychoses and major depression the forecast of this disease is unpredictable. There is a high suicidal risk among BD affected individuals. In this review we will consider lithium, the drug of choice in treatment of this disorder with special emphasis on pharmacology and toxicity. We have also elucidated the alternatives to lithium, since it has a wide spectrum of side-effects. Lithium is known to interact with many types of drugs used to treat different ailments in humans. This could cause either augmentation or minimization of the therapeutic action, causing secondary undesired effects of the agent. This necessitates a search for other alternatives and/or different combinations to lithium in order to decrease the range of unwanted effects for which it has received discredit. These alternatives should be potent mood stabilizers as monotherapy so as to avoid polypharmacy. If not, one should find the best combination of drugs (synergistic agents) such that the lithium dose can be minimized, thereby securing a more potent drug therapy. This study also focuses on the provision of instruction to psychiatric care givers, such as junior doctors in residency, nurses in psychiatric units, psychiatric emergency personnel and, additionally, medical and pharmacy students.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Oruch R ; Elderbi MA ; Khattab HA ; Pryme IF ; Lund A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejphar.2014.06.042 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Antimanic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nBreast Feeding\r\nDrug Overdose\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\n*Lithium Compounds/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nPregnancy\r\nBipolar affective disorder\r\nCarbamazepine\r\nCarbamzepine (PubChem CID 2554)\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLamotrigine (PubChem CID 3878)\r\nLithium\r\nLithium (PubChem CID 28486)\r\nLurasidone (PubChem CID 213046)\r\nMajor depression\r\nValproate\r\nValproate (PubChem CID 3121)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Oruch R, Elderbi MA, Khattab HA, Pryme IF, and Lund A (2014) Lithium: a review of pharmacology, clinical uses, and toxicity..

However, it is unknown whether these factors predict treatment outcome. METHODS: Data from six double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials with aripiprazole in acute manic or mixed episodes in adults with bipolar I disorder were pooled for this analysis and the previously identified factors were examined for their value in predicting treatment outcome. Treatment efficacy was assessed for aripiprazole (n = 1,001), haloperidol (n = 324), lithium (n = 155), and placebo (n = 694) at baseline, days 4, 7, and 10, and then weekly to study end. Mean change in factor scores from baseline to week 3 was assessed by receiver operating characteristics curves for percentage factor change at day 4 and week 1. RESULTS: Subjects receiving aripiprazole, haloperidol, and lithium significantly improved mania factor scores versus placebo. Factors most predictive of endpoint efficacy for aripiprazole were judgment/impulsivity at day 4 and mania at week 1. Optimal factor score improvement for outcome prediction was approximately 40% to 50%. Early efficacy predicted treatment outcome across all factors; however, response at week 1 was a better predictor than response at day 4. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis confirms clinical benefits in early treatment/assessment for subjects with bipolar mania and suggests that certain symptom factors in mixed or manic episodes may be most predictive of treatment response.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ostacher MJ ; Suppes T ; Swann AC ; Eudicone JM ; Landsberg W ; Baker RA ; Carlson BX ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s40345-015-0026-0 ","Keywords":"Antipsychotic\r\nAripiprazole\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nFactor analysis\r\nMania\r\nTreatment outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ostacher MJ, Suppes T, Swann AC, Eudicone JM, Landsberg W, Baker RA, and Carlson BX (2015) Patterns of response to aripiprazole, lithium, haloperidol, and placebo across factor scores of mania..

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of lithium and lamotrigine for maintenance treatment in clinically stable patients with adult BD. METHODS: This meta-analysis included only double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials with an enrichment design that selected patients who responded acutely to lithium or lamotrigine. Reports prior to November 15, 2018, were retrieved from the PubMed/Cochrane Library/Embase. The primary outcome was the relapse rate due to any mood episode at the study endpoint. Other outcomes were relapse rates due to a manic/hypomanic/mixed episode or depression at the study endpoint, discontinuation rate, death, and death by suicide. Risk ratios (RRs) (95% confidence intervals) were calculated. When the random-effects model showed significant differences between groups, the number-needed-to-treat (NNT) was estimated. RESULTS: The search retrieved two studies regarding lithium (N = 218) and four evaluating lamotrigine (N = 706). Both drugs were superior to placebo for reducing the relapse rate due to any mood episode [lithium: RR = 0.52 (0.41-0.66), P < 0.00001, I(2) = 0%, NNT = 2.3 (1.6-4.2); lamotrigine: RR = 0.81 (0.70-0.93), P = 0.004, I(2) = 0%, NNT = 8.3 (5.0-25.0)] and all-cause discontinuation. There were no significant differences in other outcomes between lithium or lamotrigine and the placebo groups.

Assessing drug levels in the blood is often helpful in confirming the adequacy of antidepressant dosages. Augmentation of the pharmaceutical activity can be achieved by coadministration of lithium, triiodothyronine, and/or stimulants. Neuroleptics are also prescribed with the antidepressant when psychotic features accompany depression. Such enhancements to drug efficacy are usually an advantage over beginning a new medication because of shorter response time. When a decision is made to change the antidepressant, a structurally different option is more likely to induce a remission than a medication of similar configuration.

Coexisting diagnoses, such as substance abuse, posttraumatic stress disorder, or medical conditions, must be ruled in or out. It is critical to include a suicide risk assessment in the evaluation. Lithium is still the gold standard for bipolar patients with its suicide preventative effects. Lamotrigine appears to have the advantage of efficacy against bipolar depression without high risk for inducing mania. Experts recommend that a mood stabilizer be used in combination with antidepressants. The tricyclic antidepressants and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors appear to have the highest risk for mania and are best avoided. Atypical antipsychotic medications are best utilized for psychotic symptoms and as adjuncts to existing antidepressants. Cognitive behavioral therapy may complement pharmacotherapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pary R ; Matuschka PR ; Lewis S ; Lippmann S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pary R, Matuschka PR, Lewis S, and Lippmann S (2006) Managing bipolar depression..

We hypothesized that patients receiving open-label treatment with lithium during a 6-week period would experience a statistically and clinically significant decrease in depressive symptoms and tolerate lithium treatment fairly well. METHOD: Twenty-seven adolescents (12-18 years old) with an episode of depression associated with bipolar disorder type I received open-label lithium 30 mg/kg (twice-daily dosing), which was adjusted to achieve a therapeutic serum level (1.0-1.2 mEq/L). Effectiveness measures included the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) and Clinical Global Impressions Scale for Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP). Adverse events were assessed weekly. RESULTS: Mean CDRS-R scores significantly decreased from baseline to endpoint (mean [SD] change = -25.5 (20.4); p < .001), resulting in a large effect size of 1.7. Response and remission rates (defined by a > or = 50% reduction in CDRS-R score from baseline to endpoint, and a CDRS-R score < or = 28 and a CGI-BP Improvement score of 1 or 2, respectively) were 48% and 30%. Side effects, which were generally mild to moderate in severity, included headache (74%), nausea/vomiting (67%), stomachache (30%), and abdominal cramps (19%). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that lithium may be effective and is relatively well tolerated for the treatment of an acute episode of depression in adolescents with bipolar disorder.

Methods: Six-week, randomized, double-blind clinical trial of lithium versus quetiapine for the treatment of adolescents with acute manic/mixed episode. Target dose of quetiapine dose was adjusted to a target dose of 400-600 mg and target serum level for lithium was 1.0-1.2 mEq/L. Primary outcome measure was baseline-to-endpoint change in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Secondary outcomes were treatment response (50% or more decrease from baseline in YMRS score) and remission (YMRS score ≤12, Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised [CDRS-R] total score ≤28 and Clinical Global Impression Bipolar Severity Scale [CGI-BP-S] overall score of ≤3, respectively). Results: A total of 109 patients were randomized (quetiapine = 58 and lithium = 51). Participants in the quetiapine treatment group showed a significantly greater reduction in YMRS score than those in the lithium group (-11.0 vs. -13.2; p < 0.001; effect size 0.39). Response rate was 72% in the quetiapine group and 49% in the lithium group (p = 0.012); no differences in remission rates between groups were observed. Most frequent side effects for lithium were headaches (60.8%), nausea (39.2%), somnolence (27.5%), and tremor (27.5%); for quetiapine somnolence (63.8%), headaches (55.2%), tremor (36.2%), and dizziness (36.2%) were evidenced. Participants receiving quetiapine experienced more somnolence (p < 0.001), dizziness (p < 0.05), and weight gain (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Treatment with both lithium and quetiapine led to clinical improvement. Most study participants in this study experienced a clinical response; however, less than half of the participants in this study achieved symptomatic remission. The head-to-head comparison of both treatment groups showed quetiapine was associated with a statistically significant greater rate of response and overall symptom reduction compared with lithium.

We describe prescribing patterns with lithium in a large sample of patients with affective disorders. Data were collected during a baseline clinical audit of the quality of lithium monitoring, conducted by the Prescribing Observatory for Mental Health. Thirty-five National Health Service Trusts submitted data for 2776 patients with a diagnosis of affective illness (ICD10 F30-39), 1919 (69%) of whom had bipolar affective disorder. The last recorded lithium level was below the therapeutic range (<0.4 mmol/L) in one in 10 patients. Co-prescribing was common; 57% of bipolar patients were prescribed an antipsychotic and 77% of those with other affective disorders, an antidepressant. We conclude that serum lithium levels within the therapeutic range are maintained in the majority of patients. A high proportion of patients are co-prescribed other psychotropic drugs; such prescribing is consistent with evidence-based treatment guidelines and may reflect difficulty managing the symptoms of affective disorders with lithium monotherapy. A significant minority of patients prescribed lithium had a sub-therapeutic blood level and so may be at high risk of relapse.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Paton C ; Barnes TR ; Shingleton-Smith A ; McAllister-Williams RH ; Kirkbride J ; Jones PB ; McIntyre S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0269881110367728 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAntimanic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Monitoring/methods\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMood Disorders/drug therapy\r\nPractice Guidelines as Topic\r\nPractice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Paton C, Barnes TR, Shingleton-Smith A, McAllister-Williams RH, Kirkbride J, Jones PB, and McIntyre S (2010) Lithium in bipolar and other affective disorders: prescribing practice in the UK..

Education of mental health workers regarding the effective treatment of mood disorders can help to reduce the rate of suicide.

The drug is also effective in the prophylactic treatment of recurrent unipolar depression, although many psychiatrists prefer to use antidepressant drugs for this indication. The efficacy of lithium is well established in the short term treatment of mania, although neuroleptic drugs are required at the start of treatment for more severely disturbed patients. Lithium augmentation of antidepressant drugs is increasingly popular for the treatment of resistant depression. It is now common practice to maintain serum lithium concentrations in the range 0.5 to 0.8 mmol/L, which is generally as effective as higher concentrations while reducing the incidence of adverse effects and intoxication. Some individuals may nevertheless require higher serum concentrations. Most adverse effects such as tremor and gastrointestinal upset are usually minor and often transient. There is no good evidence of nephrotoxicity with long term treatment, but persistent polyuria can occur. Hypothyroidism, with or without goitre, can occur uncommonly during long term lithium therapy. Prescribers should be alert to, and patients should be educated about, the predisposing factors and early symptoms relating to lithium intoxication. Specialist mood disorder clinics can facilitate safer and more effective lithium treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Peet M ; Pratt JP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2165/00003495-199346010-00002 ","Keywords":"Affective Disorders, Psychotic/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Interactions\r\nDrug Tolerance\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMonitoring, Physiologic\r\nPatient Participation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Peet M, and Pratt JP (1993) Lithium.

METHODS: Narrative review of randomized clinical trials and open-label studies published from 2000 to 2012. The PubMed and PsycINFO websites were queried. Case series were included when a higher level of evidence was not available. RESULTS: Published data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in acute mania/hypomania with significant responses are available for lithium, topiramate, risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole. Open trials of lithium and lamotrigine show that these drugs may be effective in the treatment of depressive episodes. No trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been conducted. In the treatment of comorbid ADHD, there are encouraging findings with mixed amphetamine salts and atomoxetine; conflicting results are observed with methylphenidate. CONCLUSIONS: Published RCTs of traditional mood stabilizers are scarce, but the best available evidence (results from meta-analytic regression) suggests that second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) as a group are more effective in reducing manic symptoms. Risperidone was the only one included in head-to-head comparisons (vs. lithium and divalproex), showing superiority in terms of efficacy, but with more metabolic side effects, which were also more common in most of the SGAs. There are few studies addressing the treatment of ADHD and depression. Brazilian guidelines for the treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder should also include some SGAs (especially risperidone and aripiprazole) as first-line treatment, and these drugs should be provided by the public health services.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Peruzzolo TL ; Tramontina S ; Rohde LA ; Zeni CP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1590/1516-4446-2012-0999 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAttention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/drug therapy/psychology\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nChild\r\nComorbidity\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Peruzzolo TL, Tramontina S, Rohde LA, and Zeni CP (2013) Pharmacotherapy of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents: an update..

Converging clinical, molecular, and genetic discoveries illuminate key roles for zinc homeostasis in association with clinical depression and psychosis which are not yet well appreciated at the clinical interface. Intracellular deficiency may arise from low circulating zinc levels due to dietary insufficiency, or impaired absorption from aging or medical conditions, including alcoholism. A host of medications commonly administered to psychiatric patients, including anticonvulsants, oral medications for diabetes, hormones, antacids, anti-inflammatories and others also impact zinc absorption. Furthermore, inefficient genetic variants in zinc transporter molecules that transport the ion across cellular membranes impede its action even when circulating zinc concentrations is in the normal range. Well powered clinical studies have shown beneficial effects of supplemental zinc in depression and it important to pursue research using zinc as a potential therapeutic option for psychosis as well. Meta-analyses support the adjunctive use of zinc in major depression and a single study now supports zinc for psychotic symptoms. This manuscript reviews the biochemistry and bench top evidence on putative molecular mechanisms of zinc as a psychiatric treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Petrilli MA ; Kranz TM ; Kleinhaus K ; Joe P ; Getz M ; Johnson P ; Chao MV ; Malaspina D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fphar.2017.00414 ","Keywords":"NMDA\r\ndepression\r\nglutamate\r\npsychosis\r\nzinc dysfunction","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Petrilli MA, Kranz TM, Kleinhaus K, Joe P, Getz M, Johnson P, Chao MV, and Malaspina D (2017) The Emerging Role for Zinc in Depression and Psychosis..

Its consequences can include suicide. METHODS: An S3 guideline for the treatment of bipolar disorder was developed on the basis of a systematic literature search, evaluation of the retrieved publications, and a formal consensus-finding procedure. Several thousand publications were screened, and 611 were included in the analysis, including 145 randomized controlled trials (RCT). RESULTS: Bipolar disorder should be diagnosed as early as possible. The most extensive evidence is available for pharmacological monotherapy; there is little evidence for combination therapy, which is nonetheless commonly given. The appropriate treatment may include long-term maintenance treatment, if indicated. The treatment of mania should begin with one of the recommended mood stabilizers or antipsychotic drugs; the number needed to treat (NNT) is 3 to 13 for three weeks of treatment with lithium or atypical antipsychotic drugs. The treatment of bipolar depression should begin with quetiapine (NNT = 5 to 7 for eight weeks of treatment), unless the patient is already under mood-stabilizing treatment that can be optimized. Further options in the treatment of bipolar depression are the recommended mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotic drugs, and antidepressants. For maintenance treatment, lithium should be used preferentially (NNT = 14 for 12 months of treatment and 3 for 24 months of treatment), although other mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotic drugs can be given as well. Psychotherapy (in addition to any pharmacological treatment) is recommended with the main goals of long-term stabilization, prevention of new episodes, and management of suicidality. In view of the current mental health care situation in Germany and the findings of studies from other countries, it is clear that there is a need for prompt access to need-based, complex and multimodal care structures. Patients and their families need to be adequately informed and should participate in psychiatric decision-making. CONCLUSION: Better patient care is needed to improve the course of the disease, resulting in better psychosocial function. There is a need for further high-quality clinical trials on topics relevant to routine clinical practice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pfennig A ; Bschor T ; Falkai P ; Bauer M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3238/arztebl.2013.0092 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*diagnosis/*therapy\r\nHumans\r\n*Practice Guidelines as Topic\r\nPsychiatry/*standards\r\nPsychotherapy/*standards","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pfennig A, Bschor T, Falkai P, and Bauer M (2013) The diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder: recommendations from the current s3 guideline..

Trials of lithium plus either carbamazepine or divalproex have generally produced favorable results, although increased rates of adverse effects may reduce treatment adherence. More recent reports suggest that lithium may be safely and effectively combined with lamotrigine, and perhaps with topiramate, although controlled studies are required. The combined use of lithium with newer, putative mood stabilizers, such as zonisamide or levetiracetam, cannot yet be recommended, but is an important area for future research.

Further analysis on an individual patient basis revealed that neither adjuvant medication was associated with a clinically meaningful change (greater than 25%) in OCD symptoms. However, lithium, but not triiodothyronine, adjuvant therapy was associated with a 25% or greater reduction in depression scores in 44% of the patients.

Only patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder were included. The primary endpoint was the change in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D21) from randomization to study end (week 6). RESULTS: There was a significant reduction of HAM-D21 total score from randomization to study end in both treatment groups. The mean change in HAM-D21 score in the paroxetine and amitriptyline groups at study end was -14.9 and -15.5 (p=0.798), and the mean HAM-D21 at study end was 8.2 vs. 9.9 (p=0.420), respectively. The patients treated with paroxetine showed a more rapid improvement with lower HAM-D21 scores between weeks 3 and 5. Tolerability was similar in both groups.

Here, we assessed retrospectively the clinical response to long-term lithium treatment, as well as the rate of associated metabolic side effects. METHODS: Clinical data were collected from patients treated with lithium for at least 12 months at the Lucio Bini Center for Mood Disorders in Cagliari, Italy. Clinical response was determined as the difference in number of mood episodes and percent of illness time before and during lithium treatment. Symptomatic values of metabolic parameters (plasma levels of glucose, cholesterol, urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, TSH, white blood cells [WBC]), and Body Mass Index (BMI) were determined. RESULTS: We studied 323 MD patients (60.2% women). The percent of illness time was significantly reduced for both depressive (F = 4.94, p<0.0001), and manic (F = 3.95, p < 0.0001) episodes, whereas the rates of episodes/year were significantly reduced for mania (F = 2.01, p = 0.02), but not for depression (F = 1.54, p = 0.06). Rates of MD patients with symptomatic values of metabolic parameters were 14.3% for WBC ≥10,000/µl, 26.9% for glucose levels ≥100 mg/dl, 54.2% for cholesterol levels ≥200 mg/dl, 7.5% for BUN ≥50 mg/dl, 21.9% for creatinine levels ≥1.2 mg/dl, and 20.9% for TSH levels ≥3.50 mU/l. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term lithium treatment was clinically effective, but the rates of metabolic effects were substantial although some of them were also associated with older age.

For this reason, the present study investigated the role of the monoaminergic system in the antidepressant-like action of (octylseleno)-xylofuranoside (OSX), an organoselenium compound, in the tail suspension test (TST) in mice. For this purpose, OSX (0.001–10 mg/kg) was administered orally (p.o.) 30 min prior to testing, and all of the tested doses reduced the immobility time in the TST without changing the locomotor activity measured in the open field test (OFT). Furthermore, the antidepressant-like effect of OSX (0.01 mg/kg, p.o.) in the TSTwas prevented by pre-treatment in mice with ketanserin (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal route (i.p.); a 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist),WAY100635 (0.1mg/kg, subcutaneous (s.c.); a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist), p-chlorophenylalaninemethyl ester-PCPA (100mg/kg, i.p.; a selective inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase), prazosin (1 mg/kg, i.p.; an α1-adrenoceptor antagonist), yohimbine (1 mg/kg, i.p.; an α2-adrenoceptor antagonist), SCH233390 (0.05 mg/kg, s.c., a dopaminergic D1 receptor antagonist) and sulpiride (50 mg/kg, i.p., a dopaminergic D2 receptor antagonist), but not with ondansetron (1 mg/kg, i.p.; a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist). Taken together, these data demonstrate that OSX has a potent antidepressant like effect in TST at lower doses (0.001–10 mg/kg), which is dependent on its interaction with the serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pinto Brod LM; Fronza MG ; Vargas JP ; Lüdtke DS ; Luchese C ; Wilhelm EA ; Savegnago L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2015.10.008 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/*metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDopamine/metabolism\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nExploratory Behavior/drug effects\r\nGlycosides/chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nHindlimb Suspension\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nNorepinephrine/metabolism\r\nOrganoselenium Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nAntidepressant-like\r\nOrganoselenium\r\nSelenium","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pinto Brod LM, Fronza MG, Vargas JP, Lüdtke DS, Luchese C, Wilhelm EA, and Savegnago L (2016) Involvement of monoaminergic system in the antidepressant-like effect of (octylseleno)-xylofuranoside in the mouse tail suspension test..

Furthermore, evidences of its use in pediatric populations are sparse, not only for bipolar disorders, but also for other possible indications. OBJECTIVES: To provide a synthesis of published data on the possible mechanisms of action of lithium, as well as on its use in pediatric samples, including pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety data. METHODS: Clinical trials in pediatric samples with at least one standardized measure of efficacy/ effectiveness were included in this review. We considered: i) randomized and open label trials, ii) combination studies iii) augmentation studies iv) case series including at least 5 patients. RESULTS: Different and non-alternative mechanisms of action can explain the clinical efficacy of lithium. Clinical studies in pediatric samples suggest that lithium is effective in managing manic symptoms/episodes of bipolar disorder, both in the acute phase and as maintenance strategy. Efficacy on depressive symptoms/phases of bipolar disorder is much less clear, while studies do not support its use in unipolar depression and severe mood dysregulation. Conversely, it may be effective on aggression in the context of conduct disorder. Other possible indications, with limited published evidence, are the acute attacks in Kleine-Levin syndrome, behavioral symptoms of X-fragile syndrome, and the management of clozapine- or chemotherapy- induced neutropenia. Generally, lithium resulted relatively safe. CONCLUSIONS: Lithium seems an effective and well-tolerated medication in pediatric bipolar disorder and aggression, while further evidences are needed for other clinical indications.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pisano S ; Pozzi M ; Catone G ; Scrinzi G ; Clementi E ; Coppola G ; Milone A ; Bravaccio C ; Santosh P ; Masi G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1570159X16666171219142120 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAge Factors\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse \r\n      effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology\r\nAntimanic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse \r\n      effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nChild\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*administration & dosage/adverse \r\n      effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nChildren\r\nadolescents\r\nefficacy\r\nlithium\r\nmechanism of action\r\npharmacokinetics\r\nsafety.","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pisano S, Pozzi M, Catone G, Scrinzi G, Clementi E, Coppola G, Milone A, Bravaccio C, Santosh P, and Masi G (2019) Putative Mechanisms of Action and Clinical Use of Lithium in Children and Adolescents: A Critical Review..

METHODS: The study was carried out as a WHO multicentre study in five different psychiatric clinics: Russia (Moscow), Canada (Montreal), India (Lucknow), Germany (Munich) and South Korea (Pusan), with the lithium tablets being supplied from Denmark (Copenhagen). Participation in the study was conditional on the patient having been in prophylactic lithium treatment for the preceding 2-year period and having been free of depressive or manic phases during the preceding 6 months. After a 2-month baseline period during which lithium was administered every day, the treatment was changed to lithium intake every second day, this regimen in most cases being continued for 22 months. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients, 42 with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and five with a diagnosis of recurrent unipolar depressive disorder, participated in the study. The number of patients from each centre ranged from six to 11. The mean lithium dose every second day was 36 mmol lithium, leading to a mean 12-h standard serum lithium concentration during the last month of treatment at 0.78+/-0.16 mmol/L. Lithium intake every second day was effective in 38 out of 47 patients. The remaining nine patients had recurrences, a number not differing from the 16 patients in the same group of 47 patients who, during the 2-year period preceding the study, had recurrences. The mean 12-h standard serum lithium concentration was lower in the patients who had recurrences than in those who stayed euthymic. The results suggest that to be effective when administered every second day, lithium must be given in a dose leading to a 12-h standard serum lithium concentration at 0.8 mmol/L or above. CONCLUSIONS: In the dose administered, lithium intake every second day was as effective as lithium intake every day. The amount and severity of lithium-related side effects were apparently not influenced by the change to lithium intake every second day.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Plenge P ; Amin M ; Agarwal AK ; Greil W ; Kim MJ ; Panteleyeva G ; Park JM ; Prilipko L ; Rayushkin V ; Sharma M ; Mellerup E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1034/j.1399-5618.1999.010208.x ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/*prevention & control\r\nCanada\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy/*prevention & control\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nGermany\r\nHumans\r\nIndia\r\nKorea\r\nLithium Compounds/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nRussia\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nWorld Health Organization","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Plenge P, Amin M, Agarwal AK, Greil W, Kim MJ, Panteleyeva G, Park JM, Prilipko L, Rayushkin V, Sharma M, and Mellerup E (1999) Prophylactic efficacy of lithium administered every second day: a WHO multicentre study..

The magnesium ion blocks the ion channel of the NMDA receptor and prevents its excessive activation. Some preclinical and clinical evidence suggests also that magnesium may be useful in the treatment of depression. The present study investigated the effect of magnesium treatment (10, 15 and 20 mg/kg, given as magnesium hydroaspartate) in the chronic mild stress (CMS) model of depression in rats. Moreover, the effect of CMS and magnesium (with an effective dose) on the level of the proteins related to the glutamatergic system (GluN1, GluN2A, GluN2B and PSD-95) in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala were examined. A significant reduction in the sucrose intake induced by CMS was increased by magnesium treatment at a dose of 15 mg/kg, beginning from the third week of administration. Magnesium did not affect this behavioural parameter in the control animals. CMS significantly increased the level of the GluN1 subunit in the amygdala (by 174%) and GluN2A in the hippocampus (by 191%), both of which were significantly attenuated by magnesium treatment. Moreover, magnesium treatment in CMS animals increased the level of GluN2B (by 116%) and PSD-95 (by 150%) in the PFC. The present results for the first time demonstrate the antidepressant-like activity of magnesium in the animal model of anhedonia (CMS), thus indicating the possible involvement of the NMDA/glutamatergic receptors in this activity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pochwat B ; Szewczyk B ; Sowa-Kucma M ; Siwek A ; Doboszewska U ; Piekoszewski W ; Gruca P ; Papp M ; Nowak G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S1461145713001089 ","Keywords":"Analysis of Variance\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/blood/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nBrain/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nChronic Disease\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDisks Large Homolog 4 Protein\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nGene Expression Regulation/*drug effects\r\nIntracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism\r\nMagnesium/blood/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMembrane Proteins/metabolism\r\nProtein Subunits/metabolism\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/*metabolism\r\nStress, Psychological/blood/drug therapy/*pathology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pochwat B, Szewczyk B, Sowa-Kucma M, Siwek A, Doboszewska U, Piekoszewski W, Gruca P, Papp M, and Nowak G (2014) Antidepressant-like activity of magnesium in the chronic mild stress model in rats: alterations in the NMDA receptor subunits..

In the present study, we examined the effect of immobility stress (IS), and Mg and/or IMI administration on FST behavior. IS induced enhancement of immobility time, which was reversed by Mg or IMI at doses ineffective in non-stressed mice (10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg, respectively). The joint administration of Mg and IMI was effective in both IS and non-stressed animals in FST. IS did not significantly alter locomotor activity, while IMI or Mg + IMI treatment in IS mice reduced this activity. We also measured serum and brain Mg, IMI and its metabolite desipramine (DMI) concentration in mice subjected to FST and injected with Mg + IMI, both restrained and non-restrained. In the present study we demonstrated a significant increase (by 68%) in the brain IMI and a slight, non-significant reduction in DMI concentration in IS + Mg + IMI + FST vs. Mg + IMI + FST groups, which might indicate the reduction in brain IMI metabolism. The IS-induced reduction in brain IMI metabolism did not participate in the activity in FST, since no differences in such activity were noticed between IS + Mg + IMI + FST and Mg + IMI + FST groups. The present data suggest that IS-induced increase in immobility time in FST is more sensitive for detection antidepressant-like activity. However, further studies are needed to examine the effect of other antidepressants in such an experimental paradigm.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Poleszak E ; Wlaź P ; Kedzierska E ; Nieoczym D ; Wyska E ; Szymura-Oleksiak J ; Fidecka S ; Radziwoń-Zaleska M ; Nowak G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nImipramine/*therapeutic use\r\nImmobilization/*adverse effects/psychology\r\nMagnesium/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nStress, Psychological/*etiology\r\nSwimming","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Poleszak E, Wlaź P, Kedzierska E, Nieoczym D, Wyska E, Szymura-Oleksiak J, Fidecka S, Radziwoń-Zaleska M, and Nowak G (2006) Immobility stress induces depression-like behavior in the forced swim test in mice: effect of magnesium and imipramine..

There is evidence that suicide rates among these patients are more than 20-fold higher than the general population and, furthermore, suicidal behavior is much more lethal in bipolar disorder than in the general population. Patients with mood disorders may sometimes exhibit highly perturbed mixed states, which usually increase the risk of suicide. Such states are particularly frequent in bipolar II patients, especially if patients are treated with antidepressant monotherapy (unprotected by mood stabilizers), when depression switches into mania (or vice versa), or when depression lifts and functioning approaches normality. Researchers worldwide agree that treatment involving lithium is the best way to protect patients from suicide risk. Psychosocial activities, including psychoeducation, can protect bipolar patients either directly or, more probably, indirectly by increasing adherence to treatment and helping in daily difficulties that otherwise may lead to demoralization or hopelessness. An extensive understanding of the psychosocial circumstances and the psychopathology of bipolar patients (including temperament) may help clinicians describe the clinical picture accurately and prevent suicidal behavior in these patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pompili M ; Rihmer Z ; Innamorati M ; Lester D ; Girardi P ; Tatarelli R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1586/14737175.9.1.109 ","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/*psychology/therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSuicide/*psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pompili M, Rihmer Z, Innamorati M, Lester D, Girardi P, and Tatarelli R (2009) Assessment and treatment of suicide risk in bipolar disorders..

In many instances, these drugs are effective alone or in combination with lithium in those patients less responsive to lithium monotherapy, including those with greater numbers of prior episodes, rapid-cycling, dysphoric mania, co-morbid substance abuse or other associated medical problems, and patients without a family history of bipolar illness in first-degree relatives. Nineteen double-blind studies utilizing a variety of designs suggest that carbamazepine, or its keto-congener oxcarbazepine, is effective in acute mania; six controlled studies report evidence of the efficacy of valproate in the treatment of acute mania as well. Fourteen controlled or partially controlled studies of prophylaxis suggest carbamazepine is also effective in preventing both manic and depressive episodes. valproate prophylaxis data, although based entirely on uncontrolled studies, appear equally promising. Thus, both drugs are widely used and are now recognized as major therapeutic tools for lithium-nonresponsive bipolar illness. The high-potency anticonvulsant benzodiazepines, clonazepam and lorazepam, are used adjunctively with lithium or the anticonvulsant mood stabilizers as substitutes or alternatives for neuroleptics in the treatment of manic breakthroughs. Preliminary controlled clinical trials suggest that the calcium channel blockers may have antimanic or mood-stabilizing effects in a subgroup of patients. A new series of anticonvulsants has just been FDA-approved and warrant clinical trials to determine their efficacy in acute and long-term treatment of mania and depression. Systematic exploration of the optimal use of lithium and the mood-stabilizing anticonvulsants alone and in combination, as well as with adjunctive antidepressants, is now required so that more definitive treatment recommendations for different types and stages of bipolar illness can be more strongly evidence based.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Post RM ; Ketter TA ; Denicoff K ; Pazzaglia PJ ; Leverich GS ; Marangell LB ; Callahan AM ; George MS ; Frye MA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s002130050117 ","Keywords":"Affect/drug effects\r\nAnticonvulsants/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nCalcium Channel Blockers/therapeutic use\r\nCarbamazepine/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use\r\nClonazepam/therapeutic use\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLorazepam/therapeutic use\r\nValproic Acid/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Post RM, Ketter TA, Denicoff K, Pazzaglia PJ, Leverich GS, Marangell LB, Callahan AM, George MS, and Frye MA (1996) The place of anticonvulsant therapy in bipolar illness..

Approximately 50% of patients are inadequately responsive to lithium and the majority of patients require supplemental antidepressants, antimanic, antipsychotic or hypnotic medications. These traditional adjunctive medications are associated with potential problems. Antidepressants may precipitate mania (at a rate about double that of placebo) or cause cycle acceleration. Neuroleptics may be associated with either more profound or longer depressive phases, and clearly increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia, to which bipolar patients appear particularly predisposed. Moreover, there are subgroups of patients who are known to be poorly responsive to lithium. These include patients with rapid cycling, dysphoric mania, co-morbid drug or alcohol abuse, a pattern of depression-mania-well interval (D-M-I as opposed to the M-D-I pattern), and patients without a family history of bipolar illness in first-degree relatives. There is increasing recognition that the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproate are effective alternatives or adjuncts to lithium in the acute and long-term treatment of bipolar illness. Ideally, one would want to assess whether patients who were unresponsive to lithium were responsive to an anticonvulsant alone prior to utilizing lithium in addition to anticonvulsant combination therapy. However, from the clinical perspective, it is often more expedient to use an anticonvulsant adjunctively to lithium to assess the efficacy of this combination and establish mood stabilization. When lithium is not discontinued, the increased morbidity during lithium withdrawal also would not occur and would not confound the evaluation of the new agent. We suggest the initial use of acute adjuncts to lithium with the anticonvulsants carbamazepine or valproate (instead of neuroleptics) so that their efficacy can be assessed in the individual's acute episode, with the likelihood of a positive response in longer-term prophylaxis. Hypnotic benzodiazepines with anticonvulsant properties, such as clonazepam or lorazepam, are often used to help to induce sleep in escalating bipolar patients, and may be useful adjuncts as well. Patients who were inadequately responsive to either carbamazepine or valproate alone may be responsive to the anticonvulsant combination. In a similar fashion, one can also utilize several mood-stabilizing drugs (lithium and an anticonvulsant such as carbamazepine or valproate) in the treatment of depressive breakthroughs, and then augment this combination (if necessary) with a catecholamine-active antidepressant such as bupropion or a serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline or if necessary a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Once the patient has responded to a combination of drugs, it becomes problematic to decide whether the last agent added was the crucial ingredient in helping the patient achieve remission or that remission might have occurred with this agent alone. A conservative approach would have merit in patients who are finally stabilized on complex polypharmacy regimens only after many years of sequential trials; in this instance, the potential risk of re-exacerbating the illness with a taper of one of the drugs in the regimen. Rational polypharmacy should thus be implemented with careful delineation of the prior course of illness (typically using life chart methodology) and targeted treatment outcomes titrated against side effects, using sequential clinical trials in individual patients who have not adequately responded to monotherapy. In this fashion, it is hoped that pharmacodynamic differences among agents can be maximized and pharmacokinetic and side effects minimized.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Post RM ; Ketter TA ; Pazzaglia PJ ; Denicoff K ; George MS ; Callahan A ; Leverich G ; Frye M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/classification/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nCalcium Channel Blockers/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use\r\nCarbamazepine/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use\r\nDrug Interactions\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nValproic Acid/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Post RM, Ketter TA, Pazzaglia PJ, Denicoff K, George MS, Callahan A, Leverich G, and Frye M (1996) Rational polypharmacy in the bipolar affective disorders..

In contrast to several decades ago, wherein augmentation of lithium with antidepressants and neuroleptics was essentially the only treatment mode available, a panoply of treatment options now exist. However, their relative efficacy in different illness subtypes and stages remains to be better delineated, as do their optimal sequencing and use in combination in individual patients. It is the opinion of these authors and many of our colleagues in the field that initial use of several mood stabilizer drugs in combination may have a preferable long-term outcome in some rapid cycling patients, compared with the immediate use of a unimodal antidepressant with an inadequate single mood stabilizer, although this remains to be systematically studied. The use of thyroid augmentation strategies would appear to have merit in relationship to not only the potential treatment of lithium-related hypothyroidism, but also in augmenting antimanic and antidepressant effects. As one moves toward some of the complex combination treatment strategies discussed in this chapter, one has to be particularly careful about drug interactions and their potential for toxicity as well as therapeutic effects. Perhaps a prevailing guideline would be to use these agents more carefully in combination therapy than in monotherapy, with slow upward titration of dose to individual patients' side effects thresholds, even in preference to targeting of conventional blood level windows. In this way, side effects can be avoided during the assessment of complex combination regimens. In addition, one should be aware of potential pharmacokinetic interactions. For example, with the addition of valproate to carbamazenine, one should reduce the dose of carbamazepine, as valproate will not only increase the free fraction of carbamazepine based on displacement of protein binding, but will lead to increased accumulation of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide. This epoxide is not measured in conventional assays but could contribute to the side effects profile (Ketter and Post, 1994). Similarly, valproate will markedly increase blood levels of lamotrigine; the starting dose of this agent should be substantially lower than conventional dosage when these two drugs are used in combination. We suggest the utility of detailed mapping with a formal system-such as the Life Chart Methodology (LCM) (Leverich and Post, 1996)-of mood fluctuation vs. medications in order to optimize and rationalize complex combination therapy. In this way, not only can the nuances of partial response be better defined, but also basic decisions about the therapeutic index and relative likelihood of response can be more readily assessed. We have discussed the other merits of the life chart method as an important clinical treatment tool as well as a research tool in other venues, but reemphasize its potential great importance in the treatment of refractory cyclic bipolar patients, in whom an initial period of remission of depression may, in many instances, be as likely attributable to the natural course of illness as the current intervention being offered. As such, it behooves the clinician to have a systematic database for the more subtle issues of dose titration and sequential addition of medications in complex combination regimens. In the face of inefficiency to one combination strategy, how one moves to the next strategy remains a highly individualized, clinically-based algorithm. We suggest the potential utility of moving towards a new set of mood stabilizers and then repeating some of the unimodal antidepressant additions and augmentation trials in an attempt to overcome refractory depression. Refractory depression in bipolar patients should be viewed as a medical emergency in light of the high potential for suicide in the illness in general (Chen and Dilsaver, 1996) and in patients who have either sustained or episodic refracto","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Post RM ; Leverich GS ; Denicoff KD ; Frye MA ; Kimbrell TA ; Dunn R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nCase Management\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDepression/*therapy\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Interactions\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Post RM, Leverich GS, Denicoff KD, Frye MA, Kimbrell TA, and Dunn R (1997) Alternative approaches to refractory depression in bipolar illness..

Bipolar depression is a major component of the bipolar disorder spectrum. Existing treatment options for bipolar depression include lithium, lamotrigine and conventional antidepressants. However, lithium is more effective in treating mania or hypomania than depression, both acutely and prophylactically, lamotrigine has only been demonstrated to be effective in one adequately powered study in acute bipolar I depression, and conventional antidepressants have been associated with emergent mania and cycle acceleration. Symptomatic outpatients can expect to spend, on average, 33% of their time in the depressive phase compared with 11% in the manic phase. Consequently, there is a need for additional agents to effectively treat bipolar depression. The atypical agents olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine have demonstrated efficacy against the manic phase of bipolar disorder and appear also to have potential in the depressive phase. Olanzapine monotherapy significantly improved depressive symptoms compared with placebo in patients with bipolar disorder in an 8-week randomized, controlled clinical study, but the magnitude of the clinical effect was small. The observed improvement in depressive symptoms became moderately large when olanzapine was combined with the antidepressant fluoxetine. Quetiapine monotherapy also resulted in significant improvements compared with placebo in patients with either bipolar I or bipolar II disorder in another 8-week randomized, controlled clinical study, but the effect size was large. A 6-month open-label study of risperidone added to ongoing therapy demonstrated improvements in depressive symptoms in patients with bipolar and schizoaffective disorders experiencing a manic, hypomanic, mixed or depressive episode. The receptor-binding profile of these agents supports a role in the treatment of depressive symptoms and clinical data are beginning to emerge of their efficacy in both the acute and maintenance setting.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Post RM ; Calabrese JR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1586/14737175.4.6.S27 ","Keywords":"Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/classification/*therapeutic use\r\nBenzodiazepines/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Tolerance\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nOlanzapine\r\nPsychotic Disorders/drug therapy\r\nRisperidone/therapeutic use\r\nTime Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Post RM, and Calabrese JR (2004) Bipolar depression: the role of atypical antipsychotics..

It appears that lithium has positive effects in depression and suicide prevention, cognition, and reducing the incidence of dementia. It increases the length of telomeres and has positive effects in prevention of some medical illnesses. Lithium side-effect burden, especially its association with end-stage renal disease, may be less than many have surmised. New data indicate the importance of long-term prophylaxis after a first manic episode to lessen episode recurrence, allow cognition to recover to normal, and prevent various aspects of illness progression. After a first manic episode, 1 year of randomized treatment with lithium was superior to that of quetiapine, suggesting the importance of having lithium in the treatment regimen.

These responding medical doctors (MDs, 8 child and 18 adult psychiatrists) rated a comprehensive list of medications that they would choose (and with what priority) to treat the child's now improved mood (mania and depression) but continued mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety, ADHD, and oppositional behavior. RESULTS: In the whole group, the drugs most highly endorsed were lamotrigine: 69%, lithium: 62%, lurasidone: 62%, quetiapine: 54%, aripiprazole: 46%, and valproate: 42%. Among the antidepressants, 38% endorsed a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, 12% a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and 27% bupropion. Of the child MDs, 75% suggested increasing the 1-mg dose of risperidone, while few adult MDs suggested this. Conversely, 56% of the adult MDs suggested using valproate, while only 1 child MD did so. There was little consensus on how to manage ADHD symptoms unresponsive to methylphenidate 36 mg/d. How these treatment options were sequenced also varied widely. CONCLUSIONS: There was wide variation in suggestions on to how to treat persistent symptoms of anxiety, ADHD, and oppositional behavior in a child whose mania and depression had been brought under good control. We surmise that this great diversity in recommendations among experts in child and adult bipolar disorder stems at least partially from inadequate literature on treatment and that a new emphasis on funding and conducting studies on efficacy and effectiveness is needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Post RM ; Rowe M ; Findling R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/PCC.19m02574 ","Keywords":"Anxiety Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nAttention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/drug therapy\r\nAttention Deficit and Disruptive Behavior Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/therapy\r\nChild\r\nConsensus\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nPrimary Prevention\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use\r\nRemission Induction","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Post RM, Rowe M, and Findling R (2020) Little Agreement on Treating Residual Bipolar Disorder Symptoms in a Child..

CO-BD is associated with a variety of precursors and comorbidities that have been inadequately studied, so treatment remains obscure. The earlier the onset, the longer is the delay to first treatment, and both early onset and treatment delay are associated with more depressive episodes and a poor prognosis in adulthood. Ultra-rapid and ultradian cycling, consistent with a diagnosis of BP-NOS, are highly prevalent in the youngest children and take long periods of time and complex treatment regimens to achieve euthymia. Lithium and atypical antipsychotics are effective in mania, but treatment of depression remains obscure, with the exception of lurasidone, for children ages 10-17. Treatment of the common comorbid anxiety disorders, oppositional defiant disorders, pathological habits, and substance abuse are all poorly studied and are off-label. Cognitive dysfunction after a first manic hospitalization improves over the next year only on the condition that no further episodes occur. Yet comprehensive expert treatment after an initial manic hospitalization results in many fewer relapses than traditional treatment as usual, emphasizing the need for combined pharmacological, psychosocial, and psycho-educational approaches to this difficult and highly recurrent illness.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Post RM ; Grunze H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/medicina57060601 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\n*Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy\r\nChild\r\nComorbidity\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\n*Substance-Related Disorders/epidemiology\r\nanticonvulsants\r\nantipsychotics\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nchildren\r\nearly recognition\r\nfamily focused therapy\r\nlithium","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Post RM, and Grunze H (2021) The Challenges of Children with Bipolar Disorder..

This is the first randomized trial evaluating the effects of combined magnesium and vitamin B6 supplementation on stress in a stressed population with low magnesemia using a validated measure of perceived stress. METHODS: In this Phase IV, investigator-blinded trial (EudraCT: 2015-003749-24), healthy adults with Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-42) stress subscale score >18 and serum magnesium concentration 0.45 mmol/L-0.85 mmol/L, were randomized 1:1 to magnesium-vitamin B6 combination (Magne B6 [Mg-vitamin B6]; daily dose 300 mg and 30 mg, respectively) or magnesium alone (Magnespasmyl [Mg]; daily dose 300 mg). Outcomes included change in DASS-42 stress subscale score from baseline to Week 8 (primary endpoint) and Week 4, and incidence of adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: In the modified intention-to-treat analysis (N = 264 subjects), both treatment arms substantially reduced DASS-42 stress subscale score from baseline to Week 8 (Mg-vitamin B6, 44.9%; Mg 42.4%); no statistical difference between arms was observed (p>0.05). An interaction (p = 0.0097) between baseline stress level and treatment warranted subgroup analysis (as per statistical plan); adults with severe/extremely severe stress (DASS-42 stress subscale score ≥25; N = 162) had a 24% greater improvement with Mg-vitamin B6 versus Mg at Week 8 (3.16 points, 95% CI 0.50 to 5.82, p = 0.0203). Consistent results were observed in the per protocol analysis and at Week 4. Overall, 12.1% of Mg-vitamin B6 treated and 17.4% of Mg-treated subjects experienced AEs potentially treatment related. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest oral Mg supplementation alleviated stress in healthy adults with low magnesemia and the addition of vitamin B6 to Mg was not superior to Mg supplementation alone. With regard to subjects with severe/extremely severe stress, this study provides clinical support for greater benefit of Mg combined with vitamin B6.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pouteau E ; Kabir-Ahmadi M ; Noah L ; Mazur A ; Dye L ; Hellhammer J ; Pickering G ; Dubray C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0208454 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nFrance\r\nHealthy Volunteers\r\nHumans\r\nIntention to Treat Analysis\r\nMagnesium/*administration & dosage/*blood\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSingle-Blind Method\r\nStress, Psychological/blood/complications/*diet therapy/pathology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin B 6/*administration & dosage\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pouteau E, Kabir-Ahmadi M, Noah L, Mazur A, Dye L, Hellhammer J, Pickering G, and Dubray C (2018) Superiority of magnesium and vitamin B6 over magnesium alone on severe stress in healthy adults with low magnesemia: A randomized, single-blind clinical trial..

Recent studies have shown that lithium can interact with other antidepressant drugs to enhance their efficacy, perhaps by specific effects on serotonin (5-HT) function. A large body of independent evidence suggests that 5-HT function is abnormal in depression. This review documents preclinical evidence of lithium's effects on 5-HT function at the levels of precursor uptake, synthesis, storage, catabolism, release, receptors, and receptor-effector interactions. The weight of this evidence suggests that lithium's primary actions on 5-HT may be presynaptic, with many secondary postsynaptic effects.

Yet, in a recent clinical trial, lithium co-treatment with ketamine failed to improve antidepressant outcomes in subjects previously shown to respond to ketamine alone. The potential for lithium augmentation to improve antidepressant outcomes in ketamine nonresponders, however, has not been explored. The current study examined the behavioral, molecular and metabolic actions of lithium and ketamine co-treatment in a rodent model of antidepressant resistance. Male Wistar rats were administered adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; 100 µg/day, i.p. over 14 days) and subsequently treated with ketamine (10 mg/kg; 2 days; n = 12), lithium (37 mg/kg; 2 days; n = 12), ketamine + lithium (10 mg/kg + 37 mg/kg; 2 days; n = 12), or vehicle saline (0.9%; n = 12). Rats were subjected to open field (6 min) and forced swim tests (6 min). Peripheral blood and brain prefrontal cortical (PFC) tissue was collected one hour following stress exposure. Western blotting was used to determine the effects of treatment on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK); mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), phospho kinase B (Akt), and glycogen synthase kinase-3ß (GSK3ß) protein levels in the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) subregions of the PFC. Prefrontal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) were also determined in anterior PFC tissue at rest and following stimulation with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). Blood plasma levels of mTOR and insulin were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Overall, rats receiving ketamine+lithium displayed a robust antidepressant response to the combined treatment as demonstrated through significant reductions in immobility time (p < 0.05) and latency to immobility (p < 0.01). These animals also had higher expression of plasma mTOR (p < 0.01) and insulin (p < 0.001). Tissue bioenergetics analyses revealed that combined ketamine+lithium treatment did not significantly alter the respiratory response to BDNF or TNFα. Animals receiving both ketamine and lithium had significantly higher phosphorylation (p)-to-total expression ratios of mTOR (p < 0.001) and Akt (p < 0.01), and lower ERK in the IL compared to control animals. In contrast, pmTOR/mTOR levels were reduced in the PL of ketamine+lithium treated animals, while pERK/ERK expression levels were elevated. Taken together, these data demonstrate that lithium augmentation of ketamine in antidepressant nonresponsive animals improves antidepressant-like behavioral responses under stress, together with peripheral insulin efflux and region-specific PFC insulin signaling.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Price JB ; Yates CG ; Morath BA ; Van De Wakker SK ; Yates NJ ; Butters K ; Frye MA ; McGee SL ; Tye SJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41398-021-01716-w ","Keywords":"Adaptation, Psychological\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/drug therapy\r\nInsulin\r\n*Ketamine\r\nLithium\r\nMale\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nRodentia","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Price JB, Yates CG, Morath BA, Van De Wakker SK, Yates NJ, Butters K, Frye MA, McGee SL, and Tye SJ (2021) Lithium augmentation of ketamine increases insulin signaling and antidepressant-like active stress coping in a rodent model of treatment-resistant depression..

Studies specifically investigating antidepressant treatment for this special cohort of patients remain scarce and results are often conflicting. A narrative literature review was undertaken, synthesizing findings from published studies, systematic reviews, and treatment guidelines specifically conducted in elderly depressed patients to summarize implications and current recommendations as well as gaps in evidence for old-age pharmacologic treatment. METHODS: PubMed and Medline databases were searched for articles from July 2011 to July 2016. Only RCTs, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and treatment guidelines focussing on the effect of antidepressant pharmacotherapy in old-aged participants were extracted, analysed, and discussed. The search resulted in a total of 26 articles. RESULTS: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other second-generation antidepressants are recommended for first-line treatment of old-age depression. The differences in efficacy and tolerability within different substances and substance classes are minimal or non-existent. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are only considered for second-line treatment, due to their cardiac risk profile and anticholinergic effects. In treatment-resistant depression, augmentation therapy options include lithium and atypical antipsychotics. CONCLUSIONS: There is convincing evidence that antidepressants are efficacious in the treatment of old-age depression and that rationales are necessary for treatment planning. However, evidence-based data on recovery and remission rates in old-age depression specific to certain antidepressant drugs are still missing in trials and are of great importance for pharmacological treatment of old-age depression in daily clinical practice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pruckner N ; Holthoff-Detto V ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00228-017-2219-1 ","Keywords":"Age Factors\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/administration & dosage\r\nPractice Guidelines as Topic\r\n*Quality of Life\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nAntidepressant pharmacotherapy\r\nDepression\r\nOld age","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pruckner N, and Holthoff-Detto V (2017) Antidepressant pharmacotherapy in old-age depression-a review and clinical approach..

Our results showed that chronic omethoate exposure significantly increased immobility time in behavioral tests and induced neuron damage in HE staining. The expression of p-GSK3β, p-CREB, p-PI3K and p-Akt in hippocampus after OP exposure were significantly down-regulated, while the influences were reversed by LiCl and AST treatment. Moreover, the combined application of AST and LiCl had synergistic therapeutic effects compared to LiCl and AST treatment alone, the expression of p-GSK3β, p-CREB, p-PI3K and p-Akt after combined LiCl-AST treatment were significantly higher than that with single drug application. These results showed that the combination of LiCl and AST could efficiently ameliorate depressive-like behavior induced by omethoate, and Akt/GSK3β/CREB signaling pathway might be responsible for the neuroprotective effect.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Qiao J ; Rong L ; Wang Z ; Zhang M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neulet.2017.03.048 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nCyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism\r\nDepression/*chemically induced/*metabolism/prevention & control\r\nDimethoate/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity\r\nGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/metabolism\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/pathology\r\nLithium Chloride/*administration & dosage\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nNeurons/drug effects/pathology\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/administration & dosage\r\nPesticides/toxicity\r\nProto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism\r\n*Signal Transduction\r\nXanthophylls/administration & dosage\r\nAkt/GSK3β/CREB signaling pathway\r\nAstaxanthin\r\nChronic\r\nDepressive-like behavior\r\nLithium chloride\r\nOmethoate","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Qiao J, Rong L, Wang Z, and Zhang M (2017) Involvement of Akt/GSK3β/CREB signaling pathway on chronic omethoate induced depressive-like behavior and improvement effects of combined lithium chloride and astaxanthin treatment..

Mixing psychiatry with fashion was a psychedelic experience, but the meeting was too busy to give more than a passing glimpse to screens showing the newest trends in fashion. Revival of old styles? That in a sense also happened in psychiatry, with experts defending the current place of lithium in therapeutics. Newest, youngest look? That was also true for psychiatry, with new investigational therapeutics challenging the place of older treatment approaches because of improved efficacy, better safety and tolerability, or easier administration. What about these patchwork trends? This again was met in psychiatry, with combination therapies aimed at a more comprehensive control of underlying processes in diseases such as schizophrenia. And these nice complements, or a few highlights? Psychiatric therapies also include augmentation strategies, which were discussed during this year's meeting along with examples of the previously mentioned approaches that are included in the following report.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rabasseda X ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1358/dot.2014.50.7.2178278 ","Keywords":"Central Nervous System Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic \r\n      use\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/*drug therapy/metabolism/psychology\r\nNew York City\r\nAnxiety\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nMajor depression\r\nPsychiatric disorders","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rabasseda X (2014) A report from the 167th American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting (May 3-7 - New York, U.S.A.)..

However, the underlying mechanism for this effect remains unknown. We measured the effect of intragastric (p.o.) combined administration of IMI (60 mg/kg) and Zn (40 mg Zn/kg) in the forced swim test (FST) in mice. The effect of Zn + IMI on serum, brain, and intestinal Zn concentrations; Zn transporter (ZnT, ZIP) protein levels in the intestine and ZnT in the brain; including BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) protein levels in the brain were evaluated. Finally, the effect of IMI on Zn permeability was measured in vitro in colon epithelial Caco-2 cells. The co-administration of IMI and Zn induced antidepressant-like activity in the FST in mice compared to controls and Zn or IMI given alone. This effect correlated with increased BDNF and the ratio of pCREB/CREB protein levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) compared to the control group. Zn + IMI co-treatment increased Zn concentrations in the serum and brain compared to the control group. However, in serum, co-administration of IMI and Zn decreased Zn concentration compared to Zn alone treatment. Also, there was a reduction in the Zn-induced enhancement of ZnT1 protein level in the small intestine. Zn + IMI also induced an increase in the ZnT4 protein level in the PFC compared to the control group and normalized the Zn-induced decrease in the ZnT1 protein level in the hippocampus (Hp). The in vitro studies revealed enhanced Zn permeability (observed as the increased transfer of Zn through the intestinal cell membrane) after IMI treatment. Our data indicate that IMI enhances Zn transfer through the intestinal tract and influences the redistribution of Zn between the blood and brain. These mechanisms might explain the enhanced antidepressant efficacy of combined IMI/Zn treatment observed in the FST in mice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rafało-Ulińska A ; Poleszak E ; Szopa A ; Serefko A ; Rogowska M ; Sowa I ; Wójciak M ; Muszyńska B ; Krakowska A ; Gdula-Argasińska J ; Kała K ; Jasiewicz B ; Opoka W ; Szewczyk B ; Nowak G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu12092529 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nBrain/*metabolism\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nCaco-2 Cells\r\nCarrier Proteins/metabolism\r\nCation Transport Proteins/metabolism\r\nCyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nGastrointestinal Tract/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nImipramine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nZinc/administration & dosage/blood/*metabolism/*pharmacology\r\nblood\r\nbrain\r\ngastrointestinal tract\r\nimipramine\r\npermeability\r\nzinc\r\nzinc transporters","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rafało-Ulińska A, Poleszak E, Szopa A, Serefko A, Rogowska M, Sowa I, Wójciak M, Muszyńska B, Krakowska A, Gdula-Argasińska J, Kała K, Jasiewicz B, Opoka W, Szewczyk B, and Nowak G (2020) Imipramine Influences Body Distribution of Supplemental Zinc Which May Enhance Antidepressant Action..

The efficacy of lurasidone in reducing depressive symptoms has been previously demonstrated. The objective of this study was to examine the direct and indirect effect (mediated through improvement in depression symptoms) of lurasidone in improving patient HRQoL. METHODS: A secondary analysis of data was conducted of two 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials assessing the effect of lurasidone (lurasidone monotherapy [20-60 mg/day or 80-120 mg/day]; lurasidone adjunctive to lithium or valproate [20-120 mg/day]) in patients with bipolar depression. Patient HRQoL was measured using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form (Q-LES-Q SF). Depression symptoms were measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to estimate the effect of lurasidone on improvement in the Q-LES-Q SF percentage maximum score from baseline to 6 weeks. Path analysis was used to evaluate the total effect (β1), as well as the indirect (β2*β3) and direct (β4) effect of lurasidone on Q-LES-Q SF change through improvements in MADRS. RESULTS: A total of 340 and 485 patients from the monotherapy and adjunctive therapy, respectively, were included in the analysis. At 6-weeks, ANCOVA analyses demonstrated that lurasidone provided significant improvement in adjusted mean Q-LES-Q SF scores in comparison to placebo for monotherapy (22.9 and 22.7 vs. 15.2, both p < 0.01) and adjunctive therapy (23.1 vs. 17.9, p = 0.01). Path analyses indicated that lurasidone treatment predicted MADRS improvement (monotherapy: β2 = -0.44, p < 0.001; adjunctive therapy: β2 = -0.34, p = 0.003), which subsequently predicted improvement in Q-LES-Q SF (monotherapy: β3 = -0.73, p < 0.001; adjunctive therapy: β3 = -0.75, p < 0.001); however, the effect of lurasidone on improvement in Q-LES-Q SF was largely mediated by change in MADRS (monotherapy: β4 = 0.11, p = 0.13; adjunctive therapy: β4 = 0.02, p = 0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Lurasidone as a monotherapy and adjunctive to lithium or valproate is an effective treatment for improving HRQoL in patients with bipolar depression. However, improvement in HRQoL was not independent of improvement in depression, indicating that the effect of lurasidone on improving patient HRQoL may act through a reduction in depressive symptoms associated with bipolar disorder.

METHODS: Sixty depressed people suffering from hypomagnesemia participated in this trial. The individuals were randomly categorized into two groups of 30 members; one receiving two 250-mg tablets of magnesium oxide (MG) daily and the other receiving placebo (PG) for 8 wk. The Beck Depression Inventory-II was conducted and the concentration of serum magnesium was measured. RESULTS: At the end of intervention, 88.5% of the MG and 48.1% of the PG (P = 0.002) had a normal level of magnesium. The mean changes of serum magnesium were significantly different across the two groups. After the intervention, the mean Beck score significantly declined. However, in the MG, this reduction was more significant than in the PG (P = 0.02), so that the mean changes in this group experienced 15.65 ± 8.9 reduction, but in the PG, it declined by 10.40 ± 7.9.

Ebselen shows some efficacy in post-stroke neuroprotection and is currently in trial for the treatment and prevention of hearing loss, Meniere's Disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In vitro screening studies show that ebselen is also an effective inhibitor of the enzyme inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), which is a key target of the mood-stabilising drug lithium. Further, in animal experimental studies, ebselen produces effects on the serotonin system very similar to those of lithium and also decreases behavioural impulsivity. The antidepressant effects of lithium in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) have been attributed to its ability to facilitate presynaptic serotonin activity; this suggests that ebselen might also have a therapeutic role in this condition. Human studies utilising magnetic resonance spectroscopy support the notion that ebselen, at therapeutic doses, inhibits IMPase in the human brain. Moreover, neuropsychological studies support an antidepressant profile for ebselen based on positive effects on emotional processing and reward seeking. Ebselen also lowers a human laboratory measure of impulsivity, a property that has been associated with lithium's anti-suicidal effects in patients with mood disorders. Current clinical studies are directed towards assessment of the neuropsychological effects of ebselen in TRD patients. It will also be important to ascertain whether ebselen is able to lower impulsivity and suicidal behaviour in clinical populations. The objective of this review is to summarise the developmental history, pre-clinical and clinical psychopharmacological properties of ebselen in psychiatric disorders and its potential application as a treatment for TRD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ramli FF ; Cowen PJ ; Godlewska BR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ph15040485 ","Keywords":"depression\r\nebselen\r\ninositol\r\nserotonin","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ramli FF, Cowen PJ, and Godlewska BR (2022) The Potential Use of Ebselen in Treatment-Resistant Depression..

Hormone replacement therapy to some extent helps to overcome these abnormalities but is associated with various adverse events. Lithium therapy is being used to manage multiple neuropsychiatric disorders and is reported to maintain structural synaptic plasticity, suppress neuroinflammation, and promote adult neurogenesis. The present study examined the effect of lithium treatment on the neurobehavioural impairments in ovariectomized rat model mimicking clinical postmenopausal condition. A protective effect of lithium treatment was observed on the reconsolidation of spatial and recognition memory along with depression-like behaviour in ovariectomized rats. The Golgi-Cox staining revealed increased dendritic length and spine density in the pyramidal neurons of the CA1 region of the hippocampus, layer V of the somatosensory cortex, and layer II/III of the prefrontal cortex in the treated group. A significant reduction in pro-inflammatory markers, Il2, II6, and Il1b, was observed in the hippocampus, somatosensory cortex, and prefrontal cortex following lithium treatment. mRNA expression studies of Gfap and Pparg, along with histopathological analysis, suggested reactive astrogliosis to be a major contributor of neuroinflammation in ovariectomized rats that was normalized following lithium treatment. Further, the treatment inhibited Gsk-3β activity and maintained the normal level of β-catenin, CREB, and BDNF. The results revealed a defensive role of lithium against ovariectomy-induced neurobehavioural impairments, thus suggesting it to be a potential therapeutic agent for managing postmenopausal neurological symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rana AK ; Sharma S ; Patial V ; Singh D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s12035-021-02719-w ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nFemale\r\nGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/metabolism\r\n*Hippocampus/metabolism\r\nLithium Compounds/metabolism/pharmacology\r\n*Neuroinflammatory Diseases\r\nPyramidal Cells/metabolism\r\nRats\r\nBrain-derived neurotrophic factor\r\nGlycogen synthase kinase 3 (Gsk-3)\r\nHippocampus\r\nInflammatory cytokines\r\nMammalian target of rapamycin\r\ncAMP response element-binding protein","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rana AK, Sharma S, Patial V, and Singh D (2022) Lithium therapy subdues neuroinflammation to maintain pyramidal cells arborization and rescues neurobehavioural impairments in ovariectomized rats..

Regarding the role of zinc in the pathology of depression, the present study was aimed to investigate the effects of zinc supplementation in the treatment of this disease. METHODS: This study was a double-blind randomized clinical trial. Forty four patients with major depression were randomly assigned to groups receiving zinc supplementation and placebo. Patients in Zinc group received daily supplementation with 25 mg zinc adjunct to antidepressant; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), while the patients in placebo group received placebo with antidepressants (SSRIs) for twelve weeks. Severity of depression was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory at baseline and was repeated at the sixth and twelfth weeks. ANOVA with repeated measure was used to compare and track the changes during the study. RESULTS: The mean score of Beck test decreased significantly in the zinc supplement group at the end of week 6 (P < 0.01) and 12 (P < 0.001) compared to the baseline. The mean score of Beck Depression Inventory reduced significantly compared to the placebo group at the end of 12th week (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study indicate that zinc supplementation together with SSRIs antidepressant drug improves major depressive disorders more effectively in patients with placebo plus antidepressants (SSRIs).","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ranjbar E ; Kasaei MS ; Mohammad-Shirazi M ; Nasrollahzadeh J ; Rashidkhani B ; Shams J ; Mostafavi SA ; Mohammadi MR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Major depressive disorder\r\nZinc supplement\r\nplacebo and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ranjbar E, Kasaei MS, Mohammad-Shirazi M, Nasrollahzadeh J, Rashidkhani B, Shams J, Mostafavi SA, and Mohammadi MR (2013) Effects of zinc supplementation in patients with major depression: a randomized clinical trial..

Patients with depression may have decreased consumption of food sources rich in zinc, and zinc supplementation may have a potential influence on depressive symptoms. However, clinical trials on the effect of zinc supplementation in depression are limited. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of zinc supplementation on efficacy of antidepressant therapy. Furthermore, the effect of zinc on plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor-a (BDNF-a) were assessed. DESIGN: A single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of zinc supplementation was conducted in patients with DSM-IV major depression. Forty-four patients of both sexes aged 18-55 years were recruited for this study from a university hospital. The zinc-supplemented group received zinc sulfate (25 mg elemental Zn/day) orally in addition to their selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants for 12 weeks. Symptoms were evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) on arrival, weeks 6 and 12. Plasma levels of IL-6, TNF-α and BDNF-a were measured at baseline and at the end of study. RESULTS: Twenty patients in zinc group and 17 patients in placebo groups completed the study. At baseline, there were no significant differences in any variable between the patients allocated to receive placebo and those taking zinc supplement. Zinc supplementation significantly reduced HDRS compared to placebo (P < 0.01 at 12th week). No significant differences were observed in plasma levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and BDNF-a between zinc-supplemented and placebo-supplemented group. CONCLUSION: Zinc supplementation in conjunction with antidepressant drugs might be beneficial for reducing depressive symptoms. However, its effect does not appear to be mediated through impact of zinc on inflammatory processes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ranjbar E ; Shams J ; Sabetkasaei M ; M-Shirazi M ; Rashidkhani B ; Mostafavi A ; Bornak E ; Nasrollahzadeh J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1179/1476830513Y.0000000066 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*blood\r\nCitalopram/therapeutic use\r\nCytokines/*blood\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/blood/*drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nFluoxetine/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nInterleukin-6/blood\r\nIran\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPlacebos\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use\r\nTumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/blood\r\nZinc/*administration & dosage\r\nHDRS\r\nMajor depression\r\nSSRI\r\nZinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ranjbar E, Shams J, Sabetkasaei M, M-Shirazi M, Rashidkhani B, Mostafavi A, Bornak E, and Nasrollahzadeh J (2014) Effects of zinc supplementation on efficacy of antidepressant therapy, inflammatory cytokines, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in patients with major depression..

There are many psychiatrically ill patients in therapy running different degree of suicide risk. The risk of death by suicide is with almost all psychiatric illnesses, but it is found more with depressive disease, schizophrenia and personality disorder. Many studies have reported higher incidences of suicide attempts and suicide among alcoholics, which is often precipitated by family crises. Drug problems, low threshold for tolerance of day to day frustration, unemployement and poor parenting are major causes for youth suicide.There is biological evidence of suicidal behaviour. Fall in the level of serotonin and 5-HIAA in the CSF and in hind brain is found in subjects dying from suicide. Researchers have found decreased melatonin level in depression and suicide attempters. Long term therapy with antidepressants (Tricyclics), mood stabilizers (lithium and valproate) and new SSRIs prevent relapses and lessen suicide. It was concluded that general hospital doctors are in position of reducing suicide rates. Education of physician in detection of depression and suicide prevention will result in decline in number of suicides. The important measures include limiting the ability of methods of self-harm, antidepressants, paracetamol and insecticides.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rao VA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Suicide\r\ndepression\r\nsuicide prevention\r\nsuicide rate","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rao VA (1999) Toward suicide prevention..

We conducted a systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions in the early course of BD I or II. METHODS: We completed a systematic search on MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL and Google Scholar from 1/1/1979 till 14/9/2022. We included controlled trials examining intervention effects on symptomatic, course, functional and tolerability outcomes of patients in the 'early course' of BD I or II. We classified patients to be in early course if they (a) were seeking help for the first time for a manic episode, (b) had a lifetime history of up to 3 manic episodes, or (c) had up to 6 lifetime mood episodes. Evidence quality was assessed using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: From 4135 unique publications we included 25 reports representing 2212 participants in 16 randomized studies, and 17,714 participants from nine non-randomized studies. Available evidence suggested that in early illness course, lithium use was associated with lower recurrence risk compared with other mood stabilizers. Mood stabilizers were also associated with better global functioning, compared with the use of antipsychotics in the medium term. While summative findings regarding psychological therapies were limited by heterogeneity, family-focused and cognitive-behavioral interventions were associated with reduced recurrence risk or improved symptomatic outcomes. There was some evidence that the same pharmacological interventions were more efficacious in preventing recurrences when utilized in earlier rather than later illness course. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: While there are promising initial findings, there is a need for more adequately powered trials to examine the efficacy and tolerability of interventions in youth and adults in early illness course. Specifically, there is a compelling need to compare the relative benefits of lithium with other pharmacological agents in preventing recurrences. In addition to symptomatic outcomes, there should be a greater focus on functional impact and tolerability. Effective pharmacological and psychological interventions should be offered to those in early course of BD, balancing potential risks using shared decision-making approaches.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ratheesh A ; Hett D ; Ramain J ; Wong E ; Berk L ; Conus P ; Fristad MA ; Goldstein T ; Hillegers M ; Jauhar S ; Kessing LV ; Miklowitz DJ ; Murray G ; Scott J ; Tohen M ; Yatham LN ; Young AH ; Berk M ; Marwaha S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s40345-022-00275-3 ","Keywords":"Antipsychotics\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nCBT\r\nCourse\r\nDepression\r\nEarly intervention\r\nLithium\r\nMania\r\nMood stabilisers\r\nPsychoeducation\r\nRecurrence\r\nRemission\r\nSystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ratheesh A, Hett D, Ramain J, Wong E, Berk L, Conus P, Fristad MA, Goldstein T, Hillegers M, Jauhar S, Kessing LV, Miklowitz DJ, Murray G, Scott J, Tohen M, Yatham LN, Young AH, Berk M, and Marwaha S (2023) A systematic review of interventions in the early course of bipolar disorder I or II: a report of the International Society for Bipolar Disorders Taskforce on early intervention..

It has been shown that lithium administration reduced immobility in the mouse forced swimming test when given 30 min, but not 45 min, before testing. Further studies indicated that this activity was probably a result of an activity on serotonin (5-HT) 1A and 1B receptor subtypes. Lithium treatment has been shown to reverse helpless behaviour in the learned helplessness model of depression after chronic treatment (30 days), where lithium was administered in the drinking water. Further studies showed that acute (5 days) administration of lithium failed to reverse behavioural deficits. In the olfactory bulbectomised rat model of depression, several immunological and enzymatic functions have been shown to be altered and these changes are regularised by antidepressant treatment as well as lithium administration for 15 days. Hypokinesia (reduced locomotor activity) is a phenomenon observed following immobilisation stress in rats. This behavioural deficit was attenuated by lithium together with a wide range of antidepressant drugs used in the treatment of unipolar depression at non-stimulant doses. In addition, a single administration of lithium slightly inhibited midbrain raphe lesion-induced muricidal behaviour (25%); however, repeated treatment (5 days) significantly attenuated this behavioural deficit. Lithium treatment has also been shown to reverse behavioural and biochemical deficits induced by reserpine together with those induced by acute administration of single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) dose of the Na, K-ATPase-inhibiting compound, ouabain.

Carbamazepine and sodium valproate have also been shown to be effective in the treatment of several forms of affective disorders, such as treatment-resistant depression and bipolar depression. The present study, using the mouse forced swimming test, was undertaken to test the hypothesis of the action of lithium, carbamazepine or sodium valproate on some 5-HT receptor subtypes. Results showed that lithium significantly potentiated the anti-immobility effects of RU 24969 (P<0.01) and anpirtoline (P<0.01). Pretreatment with lithium did not induce any significant antidepressant-like effects when tested in combination with 8-OH-DPAT, NAN-190 or (+/-) pindolol. Pretreatment with carbamazepine provoked anti-immobility effects when tested in combination with RU 24969 (P<0.01) and 8-OH-DPAT (P<0.01), whereas prior administration of sodium valproate enhanced the antidepressant-like effects of (+/-) pindolol (P<0.01), 8-OH-DPAT (P<0.01) and RU 24969 (P<0.01). In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that lithium may be acting through 5-HT1B receptors, whereas the action of carbamazepine and sodium valproate seems to involve 5-HT1A receptors in the mouse forced swimming test. However, considering the complexity of the actions of these compounds, it is possible that other neurotransmitter systems/receptors may be involved.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Redrobe JP ; Bourin M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s002130050846 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntimanic Agents/pharmacology\r\nCarbamazepine/pharmacology\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Interactions\r\nLithium/*pharmacology\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/*drug effects\r\nPiperidines/pharmacology\r\nPyridines/pharmacology\r\nReceptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1B\r\nReceptors, Serotonin/drug effects/*metabolism\r\nSerotonin Receptor Agonists/pharmacology\r\n*Swimming\r\nValproic Acid/pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Redrobe JP, and Bourin M (1999) Evidence of the activity of lithium on 5-HT1B receptors in the mouse forced swimming test: comparison with carbamazepine and sodium valproate..

Despite this high number of affected individuals, more than 50% of patients do not respond to antidepressants approved to treat MDD. Patients with MDD that do not respond to 2 or more first-line antidepressant treatments are considered to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Animal models of depression are important tools to better understand the pathophysiology of MDD as well as to help in the development of novel and fast antidepressants for TRD patients. This review will emphasize some discovery strategies for TRD from studies on animal models, including, antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (ketamine and memantine), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), lithium, minocycline, quetiapine, and deep brain stimulation. Animal models of depression are not sufficient to represent all the traits of TRD, but they greatly aid in understanding the mechanism by which therapies that work for TRD exert antidepressant effects. Interestingly, these innovative therapies have mechanisms of action different from those of classic antidepressants. These effects are mainly related to the regulation of neurotransmitter activity, including general glutamate and increased connectivity, synaptic capacity, and neuroplasticity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Réus GZ ; de Moura AB ; Borba LA ; Abelaira HM ; Quevedo J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000500324 ","Keywords":"Deep brain stimulation\r\nElectroconvulsive therapy\r\nN-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist\r\nQuetiapine\r\nTreatment-resistant depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Réus GZ, de Moura AB, Borba LA, Abelaira HM, and Quevedo J (2019) Strategies for Treatment-Resistant Depression: Lessons Learned from Animal Models..

Areas covered: This paper addresses the historical use of lithium, modern indications for its use, guidelines for prescribing and monitoring continued lithium use, drug-drug interactions, and pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetic properties. The paper also reviews the unique properties of lithium and their potential clinical importance. Expert opinion: While the use of lithium does involve some unique risks to the patient, it may also has some unique advantages in certain patient populations. Two major findings that make lithium unique are its potential neuroprotective benefits and decreased risk of suicide in patients with mood disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Richardson T ; Macaluso M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/17425255.2017.1386653 ","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDrug Interactions\r\nDrug Monitoring/methods\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nPractice Guidelines as Topic\r\nSuicide Prevention\r\nLithium\r\nbipolar depression\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ndrug-drug interactions\r\nmania\r\nmood stabilizer\r\npharmacodynamics\r\npharmacokinetics","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Richardson T, and Macaluso M (2017) Clinically relevant treatment considerations regarding lithium use in bipolar disorder..

Neuroprotective and procognitive effects of lithium have been evidenced. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been shown to play a key role in the pathophysiology of several neurological and psychiatric disorders. The BDNF hypothesis of depression postulates that a loss of BDNF is directly involved in the pathophysiology of depression, and its restoration may underlie the therapeutic efficacy of antidepressant treatments. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor serum concentrations were measured in a total of 83 acutely depressed patients before and after 4 weeks of lithium augmentation. A significant BDNF increase has been found during treatment (F2,81 = 5.04, P < 0.05). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentrations at baseline correlated negatively with relative Hamilton Depression Scale change after treatment with lithium (n = 83; r = -0.23; P < 0.05). This is the first study showing that lithium augmentation of an antidepressant strategy can increase BDNF serum concentrations. Our study replicates previous findings showing that serum BDNF levels in patients with depressive episodes increase during effective antidepressant treatment. Further studies are needed to separate specific effects of different antidepressants on BDNF concentration and address potential BDNF downstream mechanisms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ricken R ; Adli M ; Lange C ; Krusche E ; Stamm TJ ; Gaus S ; Koehler S ; Nase S ; Bschor T ; Richter C ; Steinacher B ; Heinz A ; Rapp MA ; Borgwardt S ; Hellweg R ; Lang UE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/JCP.0b013e3182a412b8 ","Keywords":"Acute Disease\r\nAdult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*blood\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/blood/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/blood/drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ricken R, Adli M, Lange C, Krusche E, Stamm TJ, Gaus S, Koehler S, Nase S, Bschor T, Richter C, Steinacher B, Heinz A, Rapp MA, Borgwardt S, Hellweg R, and Lang UE (2013) Brain-derived neurotrophic factor serum concentrations in acute depressive patients increase during lithium augmentation of antidepressants..

OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the effect of 7-chloro-4-(phenylselanyl) quinoline (4-PSQ) on obesity parameters, behavioral and neurochemical alterations in hypothalamic obese rats. METHODS: Male Wistar rats received subcutaneous neonatal injections of monosodium glutamate (MSG, 4g/kg) or saline. After the Lee Index evaluation, rats were divided into groups and treated with 4-PSQ (5 mg/kg, intragastric route) or canola oil once a day (post-natal days (PND) 60→76). Open-field, elevated plus-maze, forced swim task, object recognition/location memory, and stepdown inhibitory avoidance tasks were conducted from PND 66 to 74. On PND 76, rats were euthanized and epididymal fat, blood, cerebral cortex, andhippocampus were removed. Blood biochemical parameters and cortical/hippocampal acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Na /K -ATPase activities were assessed. RESULTS: MSG increased the Lee Index characterizing the chemically induced hypothalamic obesity model. 4-PSQ reversed the increases of epididymal fat, blood glucose, and triglyceride levels caused by MSG exposure. 4-PSQ attenuated anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors induced by neonatal administrations of MSG. Memory deficits found in MSG-obese rats were reversed by treatment with 4-PSQ.

Regarding preferential outcomes, one study found that older youth respond better to lithium than younger youth; all youth, regardless of age, respond similarly to valproate. One study found non-obese youth and those with comorbid attention deficit hyper-activity disorder respond better to risperidone than lithium. Results are mixed for psychosis and disruptive behavior disorders on risperidone compared to divalproex. Tentatively, youth with generalized anxiety are more likely to respond to valproate while youth with panic preferentially respond to lithium. Psychotherapy findings from two studies suggest that sex, age, race, baseline mania, and past-month suicidal ideation/non-suicidal self-injury do not moderate outcomes. Although not replicated, higher baseline inflammatory markers are associated with greater decreases in depressive symptoms; baseline higher self-esteem and comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are associated with steeper decreases in (hypo)manic symptoms.Conclusions: Findings are mixed on the role of baseline mood severity, other comorbid disorders, parental depression, family income, and expressed emotion in moderating treatment outcomes. Replication of these possible moderators is needed for both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy interventions before conclusive results can be determined.

METHOD: Literature searches were undertaken and the results reviewed. RESULTS: Treatment-resistant depression is common (15-30%). Various strategies exist for dealing with resistant depression, including pharmacological potentiation, i.e. adding a treatment that itself does not have antidepressant actions but that enhances the efficacy of the original treatment. Lithium, triiodothyronine (T3) and buspirone are the best studied potentiating drugs, although other options include pindolol, dopaminergic agents, second-generation antipsychotics, psychostimulants, hormones and anticonvulsants. CONCLUSION: Several pharmacological potentiation strategies exist. Whilst good evidence exists for lithium combined with antidepressants, although good results have also been reported with augmentation strategies involving T3 or buspirone.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ros S ; Agüera L ; de la Gándara J ; Rojo JE ; de Pedro JM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00676.x ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nBuspirone/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nTriiodothyronine/pharmacology/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ros S, Agüera L, de la Gándara J, Rojo JE, and de Pedro JM (2005) Potentiation strategies for treatment-resistant depression..

The efficacy of the augmentation therapeutic strategy is supported by these analyses, involving 969 patients. The optimal dose and the most effective blood levels of lithium are unclear, but a reasonable strategy would be to start with low doses (600-900 mg/day) and, if necessary, to increase the doses to obtain a level in accordance with the usual therapeutic range of blood levels (0.8-1.2 mEq/L). Some patients respond quickly, but others need a long and combined treatment; it is thus advantageous to prescribe lithium for at least 3 to 6 weeks. Despite the fact that the mechanism of action of lithium augmentation is still unknown, all refractory depressed patients can potentially be treated by lithium augmentation, particularly bipolar patients, to obtain full prophylactic effect as soon as possible.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rouillon F ; Gorwood P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/psychology\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/prevention & control/psychology\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rouillon F, and Gorwood P (1998) The use of lithium to augment antidepressant medication..

These patients tend to have a more severe course of illness and are at an increased risk of suicide. Next step treatment options for patients with TRD, include switching to a different antidepressant, combining more than one antidepressant, or augmenting an antidepressant with another (non-antidepressant) medication. It is unclear which of these treatment approaches should be applied to a given patient, and in what order. Due to this ambiguity, comparing antidepressants and augmentation agents on the basis of their efficacy, tolerability, and speed of symptom relief would be beneficial for clinicians. To accomplish this, a systematic search was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Only randomized controlled trials were included in this qualitative synthesis, resulting in 66 articles. This review identified several effective pharmaco-therapeutic strategies that are currently available for patients with TRD. Ketamine and esketamine appear to be effective for the treatment of TRD. Augmentation with certain second generation antipsychotics, such as quetiapine or aripiprazole is likewise effective, and may be preferred over switching to antidepressant monotherapy. While the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine was one of the first pharmacotherapy approved for TRD, and its use may be limited by metabolic side-effects. Other effective strategies include augmentation with lithium, liothyronine (T3), lamotrigine, or combination of antidepressants including bupropion, tricyclics, or mirtazapine. There is insufficient research to demonstrate the efficacy of ziprasidone or levothyroxine (T4). A shared decision-making approach is recommended to guide treatment selection to address each patient's individual needs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ruberto VL ; Jha MK ; Murrough JW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ph13060116 ","Keywords":"antidepressant\r\ndepression\r\nketamine\r\nlithium\r\nmajor depressive disorder\r\npharmacotherapy\r\ntreatment resistant","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ruberto VL, Jha MK, and Murrough JW (2020) Pharmacological Treatments for Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression..

METHOD: Subjects entered the study during an acute mood episode. Subjects were treated with primarily lithium pharmacotherapy and with either psychotherapy specific to bipolar disorder, which included help in regularizing daily routines, or nonspecific, intensive clinical management involving regular visits with empathic clinicians. Data on prior suicide attempts were obtained retrospectively from interviews with the NIMH-Life-Chart method. Data on suicide attempts during the clinical trial were collected systematically throughout the protocol. RESULTS: The rate of suicide attempts was 1.05 per 100 person-months before patients entered the trial. Patients experienced a threefold reduction in the rate of suicide attempts during the acute treatment phase (until the patient achieved stabilization, defined by completion of 4 weeks during which the patient had a mean score of < or =7 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and < or =7 on the Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Scale) and a 17.5-fold reduction during maintenance treatment. Poisson loglinear regression analysis modeling the relationship between the observed rates and the three protocol stages (pretreatment, acute, and maintenance) showed that the reductions were significant in the acute and maintenance phases, compared with the pretreatment phase. No patient with one or more suicide attempts before entering the trial attempted suicide during the protocol. CONCLUSIONS: A treatment program in a maximally supportive clinical environment can significantly reduce suicidal behavior in high-risk patients with bipolar I disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rucci P ; Frank E ; Kostelnik B ; Fagiolini A ; Mallinger AG ; Swartz HA ; Thase ME ; Siegel L ; Wilson D ; Kupfer DJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ajp.159.7.1160 ","Keywords":"Acute Disease\r\nAdult\r\nBipolar Disorder/prevention & control/psychology/*therapy\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales/statistics & numerical data\r\nPsychotherapy/*methods\r\nSuicide, Attempted/psychology/*statistics & numerical data","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rucci P, Frank E, Kostelnik B, Fagiolini A, Mallinger AG, Swartz HA, Thase ME, Siegel L, Wilson D, and Kupfer DJ (2002) Suicide attempts in patients with bipolar I disorder during acute and maintenance phases of intensive treatment with pharmacotherapy and adjunctive psychotherapy..

The study enrolls 4000 adults (ages 18-75) from both primary and specialty care practices who have not had either a prior inadequate response or clear-cut intolerance to a robust trial of protocol treatments during the current major depressive episode. After receiving citalopram (level 1), participants without sufficient symptomatic benefit are eligible for randomization to level 2 treatments, which entail four switch options (sertraline, bupropion, venlafaxine, cognitive therapy) and three citalopram augment options (bupropion, buspirone, cognitive therapy). Those who receive cognitive therapy (switch or augment options) at level 2 without sufficient improvement are eligible for randomization to one of two level 2A switch options (venlafaxine or bupropion). Level 2 and 2A participants are eligible for random assignment to two switch options (mirtazapine or nortriptyline) and to two augment options (lithium or thyroid hormone) added to the primary antidepressant (citalopram, bupropion, sertraline, or venlafaxine) (level 3). Those without sufficient improvement at level 3 are eligible for level 4 random assignment to one of two switch options (tranylcypromine or the combination of mirtazapine and venlafaxine). The primary outcome is the clinician-rated, 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, administered at entry and exit from each treatment level through telephone interviews by assessors masked to treatment assignments. Secondary outcomes include self-reported depressive symptoms, physical and mental function, side-effect burden, client satisfaction, and health care utilization and cost. Participants with an adequate symptomatic response may enter the 12-month naturalistic follow-up phase with brief monthly and more complete quarterly assessments.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rush AJ ; Fava M ; Wisniewski SR ; Lavori PW ; Trivedi MH ; Sackeim HA ; Thase ME ; Nierenberg AA ; Quitkin FM ; Kashner TM ; Kupfer DJ ; Rosenbaum JF ; Alpert J ; Stewart JW ; McGrath PJ ; Biggs MM ; Shores-Wilson K ; Lebowitz BD ; Ritz L ; Niederehe G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0197-2456(03)00112-0 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nChronic Disease\r\nCitalopram/therapeutic use\r\nClinical Protocols\r\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nProspective Studies\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nResearch Design\r\nSample Size\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rush AJ, Fava M, Wisniewski SR, Lavori PW, Trivedi MH, Sackeim HA, Thase ME, Nierenberg AA, Quitkin FM, Kashner TM, Kupfer DJ, Rosenbaum JF, Alpert J, Stewart JW, McGrath PJ, Biggs MM, Shores-Wilson K, Lebowitz BD, Ritz L, and Niederehe G (2004) Sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression (STAR*D): rationale and design..

Adult outpatients (n=4041) with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder, substantial chronic and recurrent depression, and co-morbid psychiatric and general medical conditions were enrolled in 41 representative primary and specialty care settings. About one-third of participants remitted in first step treatment with citalopram, 50% of these within 6 weeks. Poorer outcomes were associated with minority status, socioeconomic disadvantage, more axis I and III co-morbid disorders, lower function and quality of life, and anxious and melancholic features. In step 2 medication switch, there were no significant differences in remission among within-class, out-of-class or dual-action agents: sertraline (27%), bupropion-sustained release (26%) and venlafaxine-extended release (25%). In step 2 medication augmentation of citalopram, there was no significant difference in remission between bupropion-sustained release (39%) and buspirone (33%), although participants using bupropion-sustained release had greater symptom reduction and better tolerability. There were no significant differences in remission in step 2 between cognitive therapy and medication treatment in either the switch (31% vs 27%) or augmentation (31% vs 33%) strategies, although participants in cognitive therapy augmentation had a longer time to remission than those in medication augmentation (55 vs 40 days). In step 3, there were no differences in remission between a switch to mirtazapine (8%) or nortriptyline (12%), or between augmentation with lithium (13%) or T(3) (triiodothyronine, liothyronine) [25%], although more participants discontinued lithium due to adverse effects than discontinued T(3). In the fourth step, there was no difference in remission between tranylcypromine (14%) or venlafaxine-extended release plus mirtazapine (16%), although the combination treatment had fewer adverse effects and had the advantages of not requiring a washout period or diet restrictions. Participants requiring more than two well delivered treatments may be characterized as treatment resistant given the substantially lower remission rates after that point. Treatment resistance was associated with more concurrent axis I or III co-morbid conditions, socioeconomic disadvantage, chronicity and melancholic or anxious features. However, if participants remained in treatment for up to four steps, about 67% reached remission. Times to remission were not substantially longer for later treatment steps. The importance of reaching remission is highlighted by the lower relapse rates in naturalistic follow-up for participants entering in remission compared with those entering with response but not remission (step 1: 34% vs 59%; step 2: 47% vs 68%; step 3: 42% vs 76%; step 4: 50% vs 83%). Clinical decision making based on the itemized measurement of symptoms and adverse effects at each treatment visit was feasible in STAR*D's real world settings and resulted in adequate dosages and durations of treatment that generally exceeded those typically found in practice settings. Although switch and augmentation strategies could not be directly compared due to the equipoise stratified randomized design, the higher remission rates at step 2 with medication augmentation are intriguing and merit further study.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rush AJ ; Warden D ; Wisniewski SR ; Fava M ; Trivedi MH ; Gaynes BN ; Nierenberg AA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2165/00023210-200923080-00001 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Clinical Protocols\r\nComorbidity\r\nDelivery of Health Care/methods\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*methods\r\nRecurrence\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rush AJ, Warden D, Wisniewski SR, Fava M, Trivedi MH, Gaynes BN, and Nierenberg AA (2009) STAR*D: revising conventional wisdom..

METHODS: The clinical characteristics of two groups of patients before and during lithium therapy were compared, namely, the 60 bipolar patients who entered lithium prophylaxis in the 1970s and 49 patients who entered in the 1980s. Both groups received the drug over a 10-year period. RESULTS: The patients who entered lithium in the 1970s had fewer previous episodes of depression and more of mania than the patients who entered the therapy in the 1980s, although the total number of affective episodes was similar in both groups. The overall prophylactic efficacy of lithium over a 10-year period of administration was similar in both groups, except for a trend towards a greater number of depressive episodes in the first year of lithium prophylaxis in the 1980s group. The excellent lithium responders constituted 35% of the 1970s patients and 27% of those in the 1980s group. The 1970s patients were maintained on a higher level of serum lithium compared to the patients in the 1980s group and had more lithium-induced side effects.

Notwithstanding such a long tradition, a number of key articles on the neuropsychiatric aspects of lithium have appeared in recent years. METHODS. This update was based on the most important original papers and reviews on lithium published in recent years. The main topics were the efficacy of lithium in mood disorders, with a special focus on cognitive functions, the neuroprotective effects of this ion and the potential of using lithium in neurology. RESULTS. Clinical studies and reviews point to lithium being still a cornerstone for the prophylaxis of mood disorders, especially bipolar. The pro-cognitive and antisuicidal properties of lithium have been confirmed as an augmentation of antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression. The neuroprotective effects of lithium have been evidenced in both experimental research and in clinical studies using brain imaging. The possible use of lithium in the prophylaxis of dementia and in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is discussed. CONCLUSIONS. Although not promoted by pharmaceutical companies, lithium remains a highly important drug in neuropsychiatry.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rybakowski JK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3109/15622975.2011.559274 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBrain/drug effects\r\nDementia/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use\r\nMood Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nNeuroimaging","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rybakowski JK (2011) Lithium in neuropsychiatry: a 2010 update..

Evidence to this effect has accumulated in recent studies of various kinds of depression in mood disorders. Additional evidence for such a connection may be the efficacy of mood-stabilizing drugs in the augmentation of antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: This review is based on clinical and psychopharmacological research performed over the past five years. The clinical investigation was based on the response to antidepressants of bipolar depression or to symptoms of hypomania, assessed mainly by the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and the Hypomania Checklist-32 (HCL-32). The psychopharmacological research tested the efficacy of augmentation of antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression by mood-stabilizing drugs of the 1st and 2nd generations. RESULTS: A number of studies have pointed to an association between bipolar depression, or symptoms of hypomania and an inadequate response to antidepressants. Such a connection was also found in the Polish TRES-DEP study which included 1051 depressed patients. Pharmacological studies have demonstrated the efficacy of first generation mood-stabilizing drugs (lithium, carbamazepine) and second generation drugs (quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, lamotrigine) for augmentation of antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression. Some evidence has been presented that mixed depressive episodes may also belong to this category. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these clinical and psychopharmacological studies appear to confirm an association between bipolarity and a poor response of depression to treatment with antidepressant drugs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rybakowski JK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2011.05.005 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Failure\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rybakowski JK (2012) Bipolarity and inadequate response to antidepressant drugs: clinical and psychopharmacological perspective..

The patient has been treated with zinc sulphate for WD and with antidepressants for depression. In 2009, lithium was added, and in 2010 antidepressants were discontinued. During treatment with zinc sulphate, a gradual improvement of hepatic indices and a decrease of mandibulofacial dystonia was noted. In 2011, a hypomanic state occurred which subsided with an increase of the lithium dose. Since then, the patient has been mostly in a euthymic mood with subclinical hypomanic periods. We suggest that lithium may be a viable option for treating bipolar illness in patients with Wilson's disease.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rybakowski JK ; Litwin T ; Chlopocka-Wozniak M ; Czlonkowska A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1055/s-0032-1323784 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/complications/*drug therapy\r\nHepatolenticular Degeneration/complications/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Chloride/*therapeutic use\r\nMale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rybakowski JK, Litwin T, Chlopocka-Wozniak M, and Czlonkowska A (2013) Lithium treatment of a bipolar patient with Wilson's disease: a case report..

The history of the therapeutic application of lithium began in 1859 and its introduction to modern psychiatry took place 90 years later. Since the early 1960s, lithium became a precursor of mood-stabilizing drugs and nowadays is the drug of choice for the prevention of manic and depressive recurrences in mood disorders. It remains a valuable drug for the treatment of acute episodes of mania and depression, especially for the augmentation of antidepressant drugs in treatment resistant depression. The factors of prophylactic efficacy of lithium in the context of the so-called excellent lithium responders and the efficacy in affective episodes were discussed. Among mood-stabilizing drugs, lithium exerts the biggest effect on preventing suicidal behaviors. It also shows antiviral (mainly against herpes viruses) and immunomodulatory activity. The evidence has recently been gathered on neuroprotective and ‛antidementia' properties of lithium, which prompted its use in neurodegenerative disorders. The biochemical mechanism of lithium is associated mainly with the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and an effect on intracellular signaling. The recommendations for managing lithium-induced adverse effects both in the early and late period of treatment as well as for lithium use in pregnancy and perinatal period were given. The necessity of overcoming negative perceptions of lithium was pointed out to increase the number of possible beneficiaries of lithium treatment.

METHODS: The most important references on the topic were reviewed with special emphasis on the author's works. RESULTS: The history of medical and psychiatric use of lithium dates back to more than one and a half-century ago. However, modern psychiatric history began with the publication of John Cade, in 1949, showing a therapeutic effect of lithium in mania. Currently, lithium is a drug of choice as a mood-stabilizer for the maintenance treatment of the bipolar disorder. The second most important use of lithium is probably augmentation of antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression. In addition to its mood-stabilizing properties, lithium exerts anti-suicidal, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective action. The drug may protect against dementia and some promising effects of lithium in neurodegenerative disorders have been observed. CONCLUSION: Given the clinical and biological properties of lithium, this drug is presently greatly underutilized in mood disorders. Therefore, the efforts should be undertaken for challenging a skepticism about the use of lithium and optimizing its long-term administration. In such a way, more patients with mood disorders can become the beneficiaries of lithium's therapeutic action. KEY POINTS Lithium is a drug of choice as a mood-stabiliser for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Augmentation of antidepressants by lithium is one of the best strategies in treatment-resistant depression. Lithium exerts anti-suicidal, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective action and may protect against dementia. Despite the evidence for the efficacy and added favourable properties, lithium is greatly underutilised in mood disorders. Challenging a scepticism about the use of lithium and optimising its long-term administration can make more patients with mood disorders the beneficiaries of lithium's therapeutic action.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rybakowski JK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/13651501.2020.1775855 ","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDementia/*prevention & control\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*pharmacology\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology\r\n*Suicide Prevention\r\nLithium\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nherpes\r\nmood-stabiliser\r\nneuroprotection\r\nsuicide","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rybakowski JK (2020) Lithium - past, present, future..

This way of treatment changed the picture of contemporary psychiatry. The introduction of neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs and tricyclic antidepressants in the 1950s resulted in a therapeutic revolution and contributed to the ‛medicalization' of psychiatry and its therapeutic similarity to other non-surgical specialties. Adiscovery of prophylactic lithium activity in the1960s initiated the mood-stabilizing drugs.During the last half-century, the most dynamic was the 1990s when most antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs of the so-called new generation were introduced. The twenty-first century marks a debut of next antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs, some of the latter having long-acting injectable preparations. An interesting event was a demonstration of the antidepressant activity of ketamine. My research domain in psychopharmacology was lithium treatment of affective illnesses. Lithium makes the topic of many papers I authored, more than 150 of them are in the PubMed database. Many clinical and research aspects related to lithium administration have been reported as first in Polish literature and some are pioneering in the world. Recently, I wrote the book Lithium - the amazing drug in psychiatry which has also its English version. I have carried much research on antidepressant drugs, pharmacotherapy of treatment-resistant depression, and mood-stabilizing drugs for which I proposed a modern classification. I participated in European projects EUFEST and OPTIMISE on the optimization of using antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia. I also performed much research on the antidepressant effect of ketamine and electroconvulsive therapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rybakowski J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.12740/PP/126249 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*history/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*history/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/drug therapy/*history\r\nHistory, 20th Century\r\nHistory, 21st Century\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*history/therapeutic use\r\nPsychiatry/history\r\nPsychopharmacology/*history\r\nSchizophrenia/drug therapy/*history\r\npsychopharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rybakowski J (2020) A half-century of participant observation in psychiatry.

The catecholamine and serotonin hypothesis delineated in the 1960s have retained significant merit. Since the 1990s, the theories have pointed on excessive immune activation and impairment of neuroplasticity under stress. Since the 1970s, asystematic subclassification of unipolar and bipolar affective disorder has proceeded. Epidemiological studies of the last half-century indicated a significantly higher prevalence of depression compared with previous decades. The 21st century brought evidence for agreater frequency of various forms of bipolar affective disorder. During the last 50years, the etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of affective disorders were my favorite and fascinating clinical and research topics. This initiated in 1970 when I began my work in the Department of Psychiatry, Medical Academy in Poznan, on account of the introduction of lithium salts for the treatment of these disorders. In 1976-1977, I received afellowship of the National Institutes of Health at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and participated in research that elucidated the mechanism of lithium transport across cell membranes. I carried out the studies on the pathogenesis of affective disorders for more than 40 years afterward. They concerned abnormalitiesof transport across cell membranes, the activity of stress system, excessive pro-inflammatory activation, molecular genetics, dysfunctions of cognition and neurotrophins, especially the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Atthe beginning of the 21st century, I coordinated two Polish epidemiological projects DEP-BI and TRES-DEP. For my research on bipolar disorders, I received many international awards. I am also the author of the book The faces of manic-depressive illness which had three Polish editions as well as English and Russian versions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rybakowski J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.12740/PP/123167 ","Keywords":"Antipsychotic Agents/*history/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/drug therapy/*history\r\nHistory, 20th Century\r\nHistory, 21st Century\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/history\r\nMood Disorders/diagnosis/drug therapy/*history\r\nPoland\r\nPsychiatry/*history\r\naffective disorders","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rybakowski J (2020) A half-century of participant observation in psychiatry.

For nearly four decades, lithium has also been used for the augmentation of antidepressant drugs in treatment-resistant depression. The knowledge of clinical and biological factors connected with the capability of long-term lithium treatment to prevent manic and depressive recurrences makes an important element of the personalized medicine of mood disorders. Excellent prophylactic lithium responders can be characterized by distinct mood episodes, with full remissions between them, the absence of other psychiatric morbidity, and the family history of bipolar illness. In recent years, many other clinical and biological factors connected with such a response have been identified, helping to select the best candidates for lithium prophylaxis. The antisuicidal effect of lithium during its long-term administration has been demonstrated and should also be taken into account as the element of personalized medicine for the pharmacological prophylaxis of patients with mood disorders. Several studies pertaining to personalized medicine were also dedicated to lithium treatment of acute mood episodes. Lithium still has a value in the treatment of mania and bipolar depression.

The second most important psychiatric use of lithium is probably increasing the efficacy of antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression. In addition to its mood-stabilizing properties, lithium exerts antisuicidal, antiviral, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective effects. The goal of the review is to describe the experimental and clinical studies on the last three properties of lithium. Antiviral effects of lithium pertain mostly to DNA viruses, especially herpes viruses. The therapeutic effects of lithium in systemic and topical administration on labial and genital herpes were demonstrated in clinical studies. There is also some evidence, mostly in experimental studies, that lithium possesses antiviral activity against RNA viruses, including coronaviruses. The immunomodulatory effect of lithium can mitigate \"low-grade inflammatory\" conditions in bipolar illness. The neuroprotective properties of lithium make this ion a plausible candidate for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. A favorable effect of lithium was shown in experimental models of neurodegenerative disorders. On the clinical level, some preventive action against dementia and moderately therapeutic activity in Alzheimer's disease, and mild cognitive impairment were observed. Despite promising results of lithium obtained in animal models of Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, they have not been confirmed in clinical studies. A suggestion for common mechanisms of antiviral, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective effects of lithium is advanced.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rybakowski JK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.31083/j.jin2102068 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntiviral Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nLithium/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use\r\n*Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nHerpes virus\r\nImmunomodulation\r\nLithium\r\nMood-stabilizer\r\nNeuroprotection","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rybakowski JK (2022) Antiviral, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective effect of lithium..

The appropriate guidelines can ensure that more patients benefit from its use in a personalized way. AREAS COVERED: This manuscript provides an update on the application of lithium in mood disorders, including prophylaxis of bipolar and unipolar mood disorder, treatment of acute manic and depressive episodes, augmentation of antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression, and use of lithium in pregnancy and the postpartum period. EXPERT OPINION: Lithium remains the gold standard for the prevention of recurrences in bipolar mood disorder. For long-term treatment/management of bipolar mood disorder, clinicians should also consider lithium's anti-suicidal effect. Furthermore, after prophylactic treatment, lithium may also be augmented with antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression. There have also been some demonstration of lithium having some efficacy in acute episodes of mania and bipolar depression as well as in the prophylaxis of unipolar depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rybakowski JK ; Ferensztajn-Rochowiak E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/14737175.2023.2181076 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nMood Disorders/drug therapy\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\n*Depressive Disorder/drug therapy\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nLithium\r\naugmentation of antidepressants\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nmania\r\npostpartum\r\npregnancy\r\nrecurrent depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rybakowski JK, and Ferensztajn-Rochowiak E (2023) Updated perspectives on how and when lithium should be used in the treatment of mood disorders..

The purpose of our study was to assess the efficacy and safety of antidepressant treatment, in combination with magnesium ions. A total of 37 participants with recurrent depressive disorder who developed a depressive episode were included in this study. As part of this double-blind study, treatment with the antidepressant fluoxetine was accompanied with either magnesium ions (120 mg/day as magnesium aspartate) or placebo. During an 8-week treatment period, each patient was monitored for any clinical abnormalities. Moreover, serum fluoxetine and magnesium levels were measured, and pharmaco-electroencephalography was performed. The fluoxetine + magnesium and fluoxetine + placebo groups showed no significant differences in either Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores or serum magnesium levels at any stage of treatment. Multivariate statistical analysis of the whole investigated group showed that the following parameters increased the odds of effective treatment: lower baseline HDRS scores, female gender, smoking, and treatment augmentation with magnesium. The parameters that increased the odds of remission were lower baseline HDRS scores, shorter history of disease, the presence of antidepressant-induced changes in the pharmaco-EEG profile at 6 h after treatment, and the fact of receiving treatment augmented with magnesium ions. The limitation of this study is a small sample size.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ryszewska-Pokraśniewicz B ; Mach A ; Skalski M ; Januszko P ; Wawrzyniak ZM ; Poleszak E ; Nowak G ; Pilc A ; Radziwoń-Zaleska M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu10081014 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAffect/*drug effects\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/*administration & dosage/blood\r\nAspartic Acid/*administration & dosage/blood\r\nDepressive Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nFluoxetine/*administration & dosage/blood\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPoland\r\nRemission Induction\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/blood\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult\r\nefficacy\r\nmagnesium\r\npharmaco-electroencephalography\r\nremission\r\nunipolar depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ryszewska-Pokraśniewicz B, Mach A, Skalski M, Januszko P, Wawrzyniak ZM, Poleszak E, Nowak G, Pilc A, and Radziwoń-Zaleska M (2018) Effects of Magnesium Supplementation on Unipolar Depression: A Placebo-Controlled Study and Review of the Importance of Dosing and Magnesium Status in the Therapeutic Response..

The evidence for these treatments varies widely; data are especially limited regarding comparisons between treatments and how to sequence them. We therefore undertook a new survey of expert opinion in order to bridge gaps between the research evidence and key clinical decisions. METHOD: Based on a literature review, a written survey was prepared which asked about 1,276 options for psychopharmacologic interventions in 48 specific clinical situations. Most options were scored using a modified version of the RAND Corporation 9-point scale for rating appropriateness of medical decisions. We contacted 65 national experts, 58 of whom (89%) completed the survey. Consensus on each option was defined as a non-random distribution of scores by chi-square test. We assigned a categorical rank (first-line/preferred choice, second-line/alternate choice, third-line/usually inappropriate) to each option based on the confidence interval of its mean rating. Guideline tables indicating preferred treatment strategies were then developed for key clinical situations. RESULTS: The expert panel reached consensus on many key strategies, including acute and preventive treatment for mania (euphoric, mixed, and dysphoric subtypes), depression, and rapid cycling, and approaches to managing the complications of treatment resistance and comorbidity. Use of a mood stabilizer is recommended in all phases of treatment. Divalproex (especially for mixed or dysphoric subtypes) and lithium are the cornerstone choices among this class for both acute and preventive treatment of mania. Regardless of which is selected first, if monotherapy fails, the next recommended intervention is to use these agents in combination. The combination can then serve as the foundation on which other medications are added, if needed. Carbamazepine is the leading alternative mood stabilizer for mania. Expert opinion regards other new anticonvulsants as second-line options (e.g., if the previously mentioned mood stabilizers fail or are contraindicated). For milder depression, a mood stabilizer, especially lithium, may be used as monotherapy. Divalproex and lamotrigine are other first-line choices. For more severe depression, a standard antidepressant should be combined with lithium or divalproex. Bupropion, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and venlafaxine are preferred antidepressants, and should be tapered 2 to 6 months after remission. Divalproex monotherapy is recommended for initial treatment of either depression or mania with rapid cycling. Antipsychotics are recommended for use with the above regimens for mania or depression with psychosis, and as potential adjuncts in non-psychotic episodes. Atypical antipsychotics, especially olanzapine and risperidone, were generally preferred over conventional antipsychotics. Recommendations are also given concerning the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), clozapine, thyroid hormone, stimulants, and various novel agents for patients with treatment-refractory illness. CONCLUSIONS: The experts reached high levels of consensus on key steps in treating bipolar disorder despite obvious gaps in high-quality data. To evaluate many of the treatment options in this survey, the experts had to extrapolate beyond controlled data; however, their recommendations are generally conservative. Experts reserve strongest support for initial strategies and individual medications for which there are high-quality research data, or for which there are longstanding patterns of clinical usage. Within the limits of expert opinion and with the understanding that new research data may take precedence, these guidelines provide clear pathways for addressing common clinical questions in a manner that can be used to inform clinicians and educate patients regarding the relative merits of a variety of interventions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sachs GS ; Printz DJ ; Kahn DA ; Carpenter D ; Docherty JP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sachs GS, Printz DJ, Kahn DA, Carpenter D, and Docherty JP (2000) The Expert Consensus Guideline Series: Medication Treatment of Bipolar Disorder 2000..

This complexity limits the practicality of treatment guidelines, which attempt to be comprehensive. A user-friendly guide can, however, be constructed by considering only the most common early critical decision points likely to be encountered in the management of bipolar patients: new onset of an acute manic or mixed episode, interepisode treatment entry, and initial treatment for acute bipolar depression. Three general treatment principles, i.e., use proven treatments first, use a mood stabilizer in every phase of the illness, and use a multiphase treatment strategy to link current assessment with an appropriate treatment plan, can be applied to guide decision making at critical decision points that follow entry into clinical care. To guide the selection of appropriate therapeutic agents, a simple grading system can be used to evaluate the weight of evidence supporting use of various options. Multiple high-quality studies with positive results support the use of lithium, divalproex, carbamazepine, olanzapine, and haloperidol as initial intervention for acute mania; other agents with positive results in one double-blind mania trial are reasonable first-line alternatives. In the absence of high-quality evidence to guide treatment selection for nonacutely ill bipolar patients, guidelines recommend maintenance mood-stabilizer treatment. Standard antidepressant medications do not appear to add statistically significant benefit beyond that of mood stabilizers alone; lithium and lamotrigine have shown some benefit, and promising preliminary data have been presented on the antidepressant benefit of divalproex and topiramate as well.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sachs GS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Acute Disease\r\nAnticonvulsants/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/classification/diagnosis/*drug therapy\r\n*Decision Trees\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/classification/diagnosis/drug therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine\r\nHumans\r\nPractice Guidelines as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sachs GS (2003) Decision tree for the treatment of bipolar disorder..

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of continuation pharmacotherapy with nortriptyline hydrochloride or combination nortriptyline and lithium carbonate in preventing post-ECT relapse. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from 1993 to 1998, stratified by medication resistance or presence of psychotic depression in the index episode. SETTING: Two university-based hospitals and 1 private psychiatric hospital. PATIENTS: Of 290 patients with unipolar major depression recruited through clinical referral who completed an open ECT treatment phase, 159 patients met remitter criteria; 84 remitting patients were eligible and agreed to participate in the continuation study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive continuation treatment for 24 weeks with placebo (n = 29), nortriptyline (target steady-state level, 75-125 ng/mL) (n = 27), or combination nortriptyline and lithium (target steady-state level, 0.5-0.9 mEq/L) (n = 28). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Relapse of major depressive episode, compared among the 3 continuation groups. RESULTS: Nortriptyline-lithium combination therapy had a marked advantage in time to relapse, superior to both placebo and nortriptyline alone. Over the 24-week trial, the relapse rate for placebo was 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70%-99%); for nortriptyline, 60% (95% CI, 41%-79%); and for nortriptyline-lithium, 39% (95% CI, 19%-59%). All but 1 instance of relapse with nortriptyline-lithium occurred within 5 weeks of ECT termination, while relapse continued throughout treatment with placebo or nortriptyline alone. Medication-resistant patients, female patients, and those with more severe depressive symptoms following ECT had more rapid relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that without active treatment, virtually all remitted patients relapse within 6 months of stopping ECT. Monotherapy with nortriptyline has limited efficacy.

The purpose of this study was to compare the dose dependent effect of oral supplementation of Magnesium chloride (MgCl(2)), Magnesium sulphate (MgSO(4)) and Magnesium-L-threonate (MgT) on memory and depression-related behaviors in rats. Rats were orally administered with different doses (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg) of each Mg salt. Following 28 days of oral supplementation, animals were subjected to behavioral tests. After completion of behavioral test, rats were decapitated. Brain and plasma samples were used for neurochemical and biochemical analysis. Assessment of behaviors in elevated plus maze (EPM) test and forced swim test (FST) showed that MgT more significantly improved memory of rats and decreased depression-like symptoms in healthy rats as compared to controls. Biochemical analysis indicated significant increase in plasma Mg levels dose dependently following MgT administration. This increase might be related to observe enhanced cholinergic functions and decline in oxidative stress in rats in the present study. This comparative study highlights that MgT (100mg/kg) is the most appropriate Mg salt and dose for oral treatment that strengthens cholinergic system and improves brain related functions through attenuation of oxidative burden in adult healthy rats.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sadir S ; Tabassum S ; Emad S ; Liaquat L ; Batool Z ; Madiha S ; Shehzad S ; Sajid I ; Haider S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Acetylcholine/metabolism\r\nAnimals\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBrain/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nButyrates/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nMagnesium/blood\r\nMagnesium Chloride/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nMagnesium Sulfate/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMemory/*drug effects\r\nRats, Wistar","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sadir S, Tabassum S, Emad S, Liaquat L, Batool Z, Madiha S, Shehzad S, Sajid I, and Haider S (2019) Neurobehavioral and biochemical effects of magnesium chloride (MgCl2), magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) and magnesium-L-threonate (MgT) supplementation in rats: A dose dependent comparative study..

Several studies have shown that iron nanoparticles have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. This study aimed to evaluate anti-depressive effect of iron nanoparticles in male rats. METHODS: Depression was induced by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) adminstration. Rats were randomly assigned into six groups (10 in each group): 1) control (sterile saline solution; 200 μL, IP); 2) LPS (LPS;100 μg/kg, IP); 3) Low dose Iron Nanoparticle (LINP) (1 mg/kg, IP); 4) High dose Iron Nanoparticle (HINP), 5 mg/kg IP); 5) LPS/LINP (LPS; 100μg/kg IP+INP 1 mg/kg IP); and 6) LPS/HINP (LPS; 100 μg/kg IP+INP 5 mg/kg IP). All injections were performed every other day. To assess the effect of iron nanoparticles on depression symptoms, rats were subjected to two behavioral tests: Forced Swim Test (FST) and Open Field Test (OFT). RESULTS: Iron nanoparticles treatment in 1 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg doses groups significantly improved depression symptoms when assessed by OFT and FST. In OFT, the number of line crossings, entrance to central square, rearing and duration of attending in central square increased after iron nanoparticles adminstration in depressed rats. Iron nanoparticles adminstration reduced immobility time confirmed by FST and OFT. Also, iron nanoparticles adminstration significantly increased duration of swimming in FST depressed rats. CONCLUSION: Our results for the first time showed potential advantageous effect of iron nanoparticles administration in attenuating depression symptoms, which was possibly mediated by modulation of neurotransmitters and anti-inflammatory effects of iron nanoparticles.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Saeidienik F ; Shahraki MR ; Fanaei H ; Badini F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.29252/NIRP.BCN.9.3.209 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive effect\r\nDepression\r\nIron nanoparticle\r\nLipopolysaccharide","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Saeidienik F, Shahraki MR, Fanaei H, and Badini F (2018) The Effects of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Administration on Depression Symptoms Induced by LPS in Male Wistar Rats..

Although there are numerous medicines available for its treatment but they all have a lag period of 2-3 weeks before they start showing their result. AIM: The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that an initial lithium-tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) combination has a quicker and better antidepressant effect than standard TCA treatment in unipolar depression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty unipolar depressed inpatients under lithium-TCA treatment were compared with twenty patients with similar diagnosis treated with TCA-placebo combination. The duration of the study was 4 weeks under double-blind conditions. RESULTS: Initial lithium-TCA treatment reduced depressive symptoms significantly more than TCA alone. The difference was evident from 1(st) week onward and persisted at 4 weeks. CONCLUSION: Lithium augmentation of TCA at the outset offers a strategy to reduce the lag period of antidepressant action. The choice can be made for those patients who are likely to benefit from long-term prophylaxis.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Saini R ; Raju MS ; Chaudhury S ; Srivastava K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4103/0972-6748.196057 ","Keywords":"Lithium\r\nlithium combination\r\ntreatment of depression\r\ntricyclic antidepressant","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Saini R, Raju MS, Chaudhury S, and Srivastava K (2016) Accelerated antidepressant response to lithium augmentation of imipramine..

METHODS: In all, 588 patients received double-blind lamotrigine (LTG, 100 mg-400 mg/day), lithium (Li, 0.8 mEq/L-1.1 mEq/L), or placebo (PBO); data from 98 older adults (LTG: 33, Li: 34, PBO: 31) were examined. Mean modal total daily doses were LTG 240 mg and Li 750 mg. RESULTS: LTG significantly delayed time to intervention for any mood episode and for a depressive episode, compared with placebo. Li significantly delayed time to intervention for mania/hypomania/mixed compared with placebo. Back pain and headache were the most common adverse events during LTG treatment; rash: LTG, 3%; Li, 6%; and PBO, 0; no serious rash was reported. The most common adverse events (>10%) during lithium treatment were dyspraxia, tremor, xerostomia, headache, infection, amnesia, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue. CONCLUSION: Lamotrigine and lithium may be effective and well-tolerated maintenance therapies for older adults with Bipolar I depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sajatovic M ; Gyulai L ; Calabrese JR ; Thompson TR ; Wilson BG ; White R ; Evoniuk G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ajgp.13.4.305 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBack Pain/chemically induced\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Monitoring/methods\r\nDrug Tolerance\r\nFemale\r\nHeadache/chemically induced\r\nHumans\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLithium Carbonate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nTriazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sajatovic M, Gyulai L, Calabrese JR, Thompson TR, Wilson BG, White R, and Evoniuk G (2005) Maintenance treatment outcomes in older patients with bipolar I disorder..

Therefore, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational and interventional studies and provided an overview of the role of selenium in depression. Three databases including Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched on June 30, 2020 and updated on April 12, 2021. Also, we searched in electronical databases of WHO Global Index Medicus and ClinicalTrials.gov. No time or language restrictions were used for the search. A random effects model was used to pool effect sizes. In total, 20 studies were included in the systematic review, and 15 studies were included in the meta-analysis. There were no significant differences in serum selenium levels between patients with depression and healthy subjects (WMD: 2.12 mg/L; 95% CI: - 0.11, 4.36; I(2) = 98.0%, P < 0.001). Also, no significant correlation was found between serum levels of selenium and depression scores (r: - 0.12; 95% CI: - 0.33, 0.08; I(2) = 73.5%, P = 0.010). Nevertheless, there was a significant negative association between high selenium intake and the risk of postpartum depression (OR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95, 0.99; I(2) = 0.0%, P = 0.507). In addition, selenium supplementation significantly reduced depressive symptoms (WMD: - 0.37; 95% CI: - 0.56, - 0.18; I(2) = 0.0%, P = 0.959). Taken these results together, selenium seems to have a protective role against postpartum depression and can be considered as a beneficial adjuvant therapy in patients with depression. Further studies are necessary to draw definitive conclusions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sajjadi SS ; Foshati S ; Haddadian-Khouzani S ; Rouhani MH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-022-05078-1 ","Keywords":"Depression/*blood/drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/*blood/drug therapy\r\nDiet\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\nSelenium/*blood","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sajjadi SS, Foshati S, Haddadian-Khouzani S, and Rouhani MH (2022) The role of selenium in depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis of human observational and interventional studies..

The most common are major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). Molecular biology studies have indicated an involvement of the immune system in the pathogenesis of mood disorders, and showed their correlation with altered levels of inflammatory markers and energy metabolism. Previous reports, including meta-analyses, also suggested the role of microglia activation in the M1 polarized macrophages, reflecting the pro-inflammatory phenotype. Lithium is an effective mood stabilizer used to treat both manic and depressive episodes in bipolar disorder, and as an augmentation of the antidepressant treatment of depression with a multidimensional mode of action. This review aims to summarize the molecular studies regarding inflammation, microglia activation and energy metabolism changes in mood disorders.

Taking into account dysregulated inflammatory activity in depression and the immunomodulatory role of lithium, we hypothesized that genes associated with inflammatory responses may be potential biomarkers of lithium action. We aimed to compare gene expression changes between the brain and the periphery after chronic lithium administration in an animal model of depression. Depressive behavior was induced by chronic mild stress protocol for 4 weeks. After 2 weeks, rats started to receive lithium (study group) or water (reference group). The control group were rats not exposed to stress. Amygdala, hippocampus, frontal cortex and peripheral blood were analyzed using whole transcriptome expression microarrays. Changes were confirmed with qPCR and ELISA assay. After 2 weeks of lithium administration, we observed significant changes in gene expression between amygdala and peripheral blood. Logistic regression analysis determined Alox15 expression as a predictor of lithium status, as its expression was tissue‑specific and increased in amygdala and decreased in blood. Analysis of serum ALOX15 protein revealed its upregulation after two‑week lithium administration. Our study suggests that lithium may have therapeutic potential in depressive behaviors. These results indicate immunomodulatory effect of lithium and that Alox15 may be a new potential marker of chronic lithium treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sakrajda K ; Szczepankiewicz D ; Nowakowska J ; Celichowski P ; Banach E ; Zakowicz P ; Kołodziejski P ; Pruszyńska-Oszmałek E ; Pawlak J ; Szczepankiewicz A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.55782/ane-2022-023 ","Keywords":"Amygdala\r\nAnimals\r\nBiomarkers\r\n*Depression/drug therapy/metabolism\r\n*Lithium/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nLithium Compounds/pharmacology\r\nPilot Projects\r\nRats\r\nWater","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sakrajda K, Szczepankiewicz D, Nowakowska J, Celichowski P, Banach E, Zakowicz P, Kołodziejski P, Pruszyńska-Oszmałek E, Pawlak J, and Szczepankiewicz A (2022) Differential expression profile between amygdala and blood during chronic lithium treatment in a rat model of depression - a pilot study..

In recent years, zinc has been found to have beneficial effects on psychopathology and the therapy of depression. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of zinc supplement on depression and neurological signs in patients with MS. METHODS: The present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 43 patients with MS and who also demonstrated MDD based on the Beck questionnaire. These patients were randomly selected and were divided into two groups: the placebo group (n=22) and the intervention group (n=21). The patients received either zinc sulphate (220 mg containing 50mg zinc element) or a placebo for 12 weeks. Clinical examinations were obtained in terms of abnormal ocular movement, muscle power, and gait disorder. RESULTS: The results indicated that in the patients who received the zinc supplement, the mean score of depression was reduced compared to those in the placebo group, whereas the neurological examinations revealed that there were no differences between the treatment and control groups. CONCLUSION: Therefore, the zinc supplementation is an appropriate choice for the depression management in patients with MS.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Salari S ; Khomand P ; Arasteh M ; Yousefzamani B ; Hassanzadeh K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pharep.2015.01.002 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nChoice Behavior\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*psychology\r\n*Disease Management\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMultiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*psychology\r\nYoung Adult\r\nZinc Sulfate/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression\r\nMultiple sclerosis\r\nZinc supplement","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Salari S, Khomand P, Arasteh M, Yousefzamani B, and Hassanzadeh K (2015) Zinc sulphate: A reasonable choice for depression management in patients with multiple sclerosis: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial..

METHOD: The Treatment of Early Age Mania (TEAM) study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, masked comparison of divalproex sodium (VAL), lithium carbonate (LI), and risperidone (RISP) in an 8-week parallel clinical trial. A total of 279 children and adolescents with DSM-IV diagnoses of bipolar I disorder, mixed or manic, aged 6 to 15 years were enrolled. The primary outcome measure was improvement on the Clinical Global Impression scale for depression (CGI-BP-I-D). Secondary outcome measures included the Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS-R) and suicidality status. Statistics included longitudinal analysis of outcomes using generalized linear mixed models with random intercept both for the complete data set and by using last observation carried forward. RESULTS: CGI-BP-I-D ratings were better in the RISP group (60.7%) as compared to the LI (42.2%; p = .03) or VAL (35.0%; p = .003) groups from baseline to the end of the study. CDRS scores in all treatment groups improved equally by study end. In week 1, scores were lower with RISP compared to VAL (mean = 4.72, 95% CI = 2.67, 6.78), and compared to LI (mean = 3.63, 95% CI = 1.51, 5.74), although group differences were not present by the end of the study. Suicidality was infrequent, and there was no overall effect of treatment on suicidality ratings. CONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms, present in the acutely manic or mixed phase of pediatric bipolar disorder, improved with all 3 medications, though RISP appeared to yield more rapid improvement than LI or VAL and was superior using a global categorical outcome.

The intoxication of As causes various neurological diseases in humans, which can be inhibited by the administration of potent antioxidants. Trace elements are also found in drinking water such as selenium (Se), which possess antioxidant potential. The main purpose of the current study is to find out the protective effect of Se against As toxicity which can cause anxiety- and depression-like behaviors as well as memory impairment. Thirty-six male rats were divided into six groups: (1) distilled water (dw)+dw, (2) dw+Se (0.175 mg/ml/kg), (3) dw+Se (0.35mg/ml/kg), (4) dw+As (2.5mg/ml/kg), (5) As (2.5mg/ml/kg) + Se (0.175 mg/ml/kg), and (6) As (2.5mg/ml/kg) + Se (0.35 mg/ml/kg). Rats were treated with respective treatment for 4 weeks. Sub-chronic treatment of As reduced time spent in open arm (elevated plus maze), and lightbox (light-dark activity test) and increased immobility time in forced swim test indicate anxiety- and/or depression-like behavior, respectively. Conversely, rats treated with As+Se (at both doses) increased time spent in open arm (elevated plus maze), and lightbox (light-dark activity test) and decreased immobility time in forced swim test indicate the anxiolytic and anti-depressive effect of Se, respectively. Co-administration of Se (0.175 and 0.35) inhibited As instigated reduction of spatial memory performed in Morris water maze. The reversal in the reduced level of malondialdehyde and activity of acetylcholinesterase in the hippocampus by Se was observed in As-treated animals, while the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the hippocampus was increased in As+Se than dw+As-treated animals. Histopathological studies have shown the reversal of hippocampus deterioration by Se in As-treated rats. The results may imply to prevent the intoxication of As instigated impairment in behavioral and biochemical indices by Se supplementation and/or increased safer intake.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Samad N ; Rao T ; Rehman MHU ; Bhatti SA ; Imran I ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s12011-021-02679-1 ","Keywords":"Acetylcholinesterase\r\nAnimals\r\nAnxiety/chemically induced/drug therapy\r\n*Arsenic/toxicity\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nDepression/chemically induced/drug therapy\r\nMale\r\nMaze Learning\r\nRats\r\n*Selenium/pharmacology\r\nAntioxidant enzyme\r\nArsenic\r\nNeurological disorders\r\nOxidative stress\r\nSelenium","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Samad N, Rao T, Rehman MHU, Bhatti SA, and Imran I (2022) Inhibitory Effects of Selenium on Arsenic-Induced Anxiety-/Depression-Like Behavior and Memory Impairment..

The monoamine oxidase inhibition could lead to an increase in monoaminergic neurotransmitter levels in the brain. According to our previous study, 3-phenyl-4-(phenylseleno) isoquinoline (PSI) is a selective and reversible MAO-B inhibitor in vitro. The present study investigated the putative ex vivo inhibitory effect of a single PSI dose on the cerebral MAO activity and its antidepressant-like action in the mouse forced swimming test (FST). Additionally, the dopaminergic system contribution to the antidepressant-like effect of PSI was also evaluated. For this, PSI was dissolved in canola oil to determine time-course (0.5-24 h) and dose-response (25-100 mg/kg, 10 ml/kg, intragastrically) curves of MAO activity inhibition using adult C57Bl/6 male mice. A single PSI dose of 100 mg/kg inhibited the MAO-B activity in the whole brain 8 h after administration to mice, while it did not alter the MAO-A activity. The FST was carried out 0.5, 8, and 24 h after the PSI administration (100 mg/kg) or vehicle, but its antidepressant-like effect was demonstrated only at 0.5 and 8 h after treatment. Lastly, the contribution of dopaminergic system in the PSI antidepressant-like effect was demonstrated by using dopamine receptors antagonists, SCH23390, haloperidol and sulpiride. Thus, a single PSI dose of 100 mg/kg had an antidepressant-like effect in mice subjected to the FST 0.5 and 8 h after its administration. Moreover, the inhibition of cerebral MAO-B activity and modulation of dopamine receptors contributed to the antidepressant-like effect of PSI in mice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sampaio TB ; Bilheri FN ; Zeni GR ; Nogueira CW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2020.112602 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDopamine/metabolism\r\nIsoquinolines/chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nMonoamine Oxidase/metabolism\r\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/pharmacology\r\nOrganoselenium Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nReceptors, Dopamine\r\nDepression\r\nDopamine\r\nIsoquinoline\r\nMonoamine oxidase\r\nSelenium","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sampaio TB, Bilheri FN, Zeni GR, and Nogueira CW (2020) Dopaminergic system contribution to the antidepressant-like effect of 3-phenyl-4-(phenylseleno) isoquinoline in mice..

It is also extremely effective in other psychiatric conditions characterized by impulsivity and aggression, and for the prevention of suicidal behaviours. AREAS COVERED: This paper provides a scoping review and an expert commentary regarding the use of lithium in adult patients. Available information about efficacy, tolerability, dosing, and switching is analyzed, and the strategies that may be most useful in real-world clinical settings are highlighted. EXPERT OPINION: Lithium is effective on different domains of bipolar disorder, including the long-term prevention of recurrences of affective episodes, management of acute mania as well as in the prophylaxis of all affective episodes. Lithium has been defined a 'forgotten drug,' since its use in routine clinical practice has been declined over the last 20 or 30 years. Reasons for this trend include lack of adequate training on the management of lithium side effects. Considering its efficacy, use of lithium in ordinary clinical practice should be promoted. Several strategies, such as using slow-release formulations, can be easily implemented in order to minimize lithium side effects and improve its tolerability profile.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sampogna G ; Janiri D ; Albert U ; Caraci F ; Martinotti G ; Serafini G ; Tortorella A ; Zuddas A ; Sani G ; Fiorillo A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/14737175.2022.2161895 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nHumans\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nExpert Testimony\r\n*Depressive Disorder/drug therapy\r\n*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions\r\nPersonalization\r\nefficacy\r\nmood stabilizer\r\ntolerability\r\ntreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sampogna G, Janiri D, Albert U, Caraci F, Martinotti G, Serafini G, Tortorella A, Zuddas A, Sani G, and Fiorillo A (2022) Why lithium should be used in patients with bipolar disorder?

Since nocturnal melatonin secretion is low in some groups of patients with mental depression, we predicted lower melatonin secretion in MS patients with history of affective illness compared to those without psychiatric disorders. To test this hypothesis, we studied single nocturnal plasma melatonin levels and the incidence of pineal calcification (PC) on CT scan in a cohort of 25 MS patients (4 men, 21 women; mean age = 39.4 years, SD = 9.3), 15 of whom had a history of coexisting psychiatric disorders with predominant affective symptomatology. Other factors that may be related to depression such as vitamin B12, folic acid, zinc, magnesium, and homocysteine, were also included in the analysis. Neither any of the metabolic factors surveyed nor the incidence of PC distinguished the psychiatric from the control group. However, the mean melatonin level in the psychiatric patients was significantly lower than in the control group. Since low melatonin secretion in patients with depression may be related to a phase-advance of the circadian oscillator regulating the offset of melatonin secretion, we propose that the depression of MS likewise may reflect the presence of dampened circadian oscillators. Furthermore, since exacerbation of motor symptoms in MS patients may be temporally related to worsening of depression, we propose that circadian phase lability may also underlie the relapsing-remitting course of the disease. Consequently, pharmacological agents such as lithium or bright light therapy, which have been shown to phase-delay circadian rhythms, might be effective in the treatment of affective symptoms in MS as well as preventing motor exacerbation and hastening a remission from an acute attack.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sandyk R ; Awerbuch GI ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3109/00207459308994278 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nCircadian Rhythm\r\nDepressive Disorder/*complications/drug therapy/therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMelatonin/*analysis\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMultiple Sclerosis/*complications/psychology\r\nPhototherapy\r\nPineal Gland/*physiopathology\r\nRadioimmunoassay\r\nRetrospective Studies","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sandyk R, and Awerbuch GI (1993) Nocturnal melatonin secretion in multiple sclerosis patients with affective disorders..

We also overviewed salient comparative aspects regarding the long-term alternative use of anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and antipsychotics in BD patients. The available evidence indicates that BD patients should be treated primarily with lithium, combined in some cases with antipsychotics especially in acute treatments, and sometimes, because of intolerance or inefficacy of lithium, with anticonvulsants. The use of adjunctive antidepressants should be limited to episodes of breakthrough depression. Lithium should be offered to the majority of BD patients as initial treatment especially when suicide ideation or behavior is present with adequate information about its long-term benefits and its potential side effects. Many patients can tolerate lithium without concomitant use of antidepressants, which may worsen the course of the illness or antipsychotics, which may cause severe long-term side effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sani G ; Perugi G ; Tondo L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s40261-017-0531-2 ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nSuicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sani G, Perugi G, and Tondo L (2017) Treatment of Bipolar Disorder in a Lifetime Perspective: Is Lithium Still the Best Choice?.

Micronutrient deficiencies are very common in the general population and may be even more common in patients with different pathologies due to genetic or environmental causes and prescription drug use. Selenium is used by people in the prevention and/or treatment of different disorders including cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, stroke, atherosclerosis, cancer susceptibility and treatment, HIV, AIDS, neuronal diseases such as Alzheimer or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pancreatitis, depression, and diabetes amongst others. Several mechanisms have been suggested to mediate the biological effects of Se and these include antioxidant defence systems, synthesis and stability of metabolites that act as intermediates implicated in diverse selenoproteins expression pathways oxidative metabolism, immune system modulation, DNA intercalators, kinase regulation, enzymatic cofactor, and gene expression. A number of clinical trials in recent years have provided convincing evidence of the central role of this element, either alone or in combination with other micronutrients or antioxidants, in the prevention and treatment of multiple diseases. Based on these studies this review focuses on the advances made so far in the study of mechanisms and applications of selenium compounds that could be suitable for chronic diseases.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sanmartin C ; Plano D ; Font M ; Palop JA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/092986711797379249 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntioxidants/therapeutic use\r\nArthritis, Rheumatoid/drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nCardiovascular Diseases/drug therapy\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nDiabetes Mellitus/drug therapy\r\nHIV Infections/prevention & control\r\nHIV-1/drug effects\r\nHumans\r\nLeishmaniasis/drug therapy\r\nMicronutrients/physiology\r\nNeoplasms/drug therapy/prevention & control\r\nNeurodegenerative Diseases/drug therapy\r\nPancreatitis/physiopathology\r\nSelenium/adverse effects/metabolism/physiology/*therapeutic use\r\nSelenoproteins/physiology\r\nThyroid Diseases/drug therapy/physiopathology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sanmartin C, Plano D, Font M, and Palop JA (2011) Selenium and clinical trials: new therapeutic evidence for multiple diseases..

To date, however, no specialized systematic review of this area has been conducted. We present the first systematic review of clinical trials using nutrient-based nutraceuticals in combination with standard pharmacotherapies to treat BD. A subsequent aim of this report was to discuss posited underlying mechanisms of action. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases, and grey literature were searched during mid-2010 for human clinical trials in English using nutraceuticals such as omega-3, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), inositol, and vitamins and minerals, in combination with pharmacotherapies to treat bipolar mania and bipolar depression. A review of the results including an effect size analysis (Cohen's d) was subsequently conducted. RESULTS: In treating bipolar depression, positive evidence with large effect sizes were found for NAC (d=1.04) and a chelated mineral and vitamin formula (d=1.70). On the outcome of bipolar mania, several nutraceuticals reduced mania with strong clinical effects: a chelated mineral formula (d=0.83), L-tryptophan (d=1.47), magnesium (d=1.44), folic acid (d=0.40), and branched-chain amino acids (d=1.60). Mixed, but mainly positive, evidence was found for omega-3 for bipolar depression, while no evidentiary support was found for use in mania. No significant effect on BD outcome scales was found for inositol (possibly due to small samples). CONCLUSIONS: BD treatment outcomes may potentially be improved by additional use of certain nutraceuticals with conventional pharmacotherapies. However, caution should be extended in interpreting the large effects of several isolated studies, as they have not yet been replicated in larger trials.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sarris J ; Mischoulon D ; Schweitzer I ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1399-5618.2011.00945.x ","Keywords":"Amino Acids/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*diet therapy/*drug therapy\r\n*Clinical Trials as Topic/methods/standards\r\nDatabases, Factual/statistics & numerical data\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMinerals/therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamins/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sarris J, Mischoulon D, and Schweitzer I (2011) Adjunctive nutraceuticals with standard pharmacotherapies in bipolar disorder: a systematic review of clinical trials..

To address this, the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Disorders (CANMAT) convened an international taskforce involving 31 leading academics and clinicians from 15 countries, between 2019 and 2021. These guidelines are aimed at providing a definitive evidence-informed approach to assist clinicians in making decisions around the use of such agents for major psychiatric disorders. We also provide detail on safety and tolerability, and clinical advice regarding prescription (e.g. indications, dosage), in addition to consideration for use in specialised populations. METHODS: The methodology was based on the WFSBP guidelines development process. Evidence was assessed based on the WFSBP grading of evidence (and was modified to focus on Grade A level evidence - meta-analysis or two or more RCTs - due to the breadth of data available across all nutraceuticals and phytoceuticals across major psychiatric disorders). The taskforce assessed both the 'level of evidence' (LoE) (i.e. meta-analyses or RCTs) and the assessment of the direction of the evidence, to determine whether the intervention was 'Recommended' (+++), 'Provisionally Recommended' (++), 'Weakly Recommended' (+), 'Not Currently Recommended' (+/-), or 'Not Recommended' (-) for a particular condition. Due to the number of clinical trials now available in the field, we firstly examined the data from our two meta-reviews of meta-analyses (nutraceuticals conducted in 2019, and phytoceuticals in 2020). We then performed a search of additional relevant RCTs and reported on both these data as the primary drivers supporting our clinical recommendations. Lower levels of evidence, including isolated RCTs, open label studies, case studies, preclinical research, and interventions with only traditional or anecdotal use, were not assessed. RESULTS: Amongst nutraceuticals with Grade A evidence, positive directionality and varying levels of support (recommended, provisionally recommended, or weakly recommended) was found for adjunctive omega-3 fatty acids (+++), vitamin D (+), adjunctive probiotics (++), adjunctive zinc (++), methylfolate (+), and adjunctive s-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) (+) in the treatment of unipolar depression. Monotherapy omega-3 (+/-), folic acid (-), vitamin C (-), tryptophan (+/-), creatine (+/-), inositol (-), magnesium (-), and n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) (+/-) and SAMe (+/-) were not supported for this use. In bipolar disorder, omega-3 had weak support for bipolar depression (+), while NAC was not currently recommended (+/-). NAC was weakly recommended (+) in the treatment of OCD-related disorders; however, no other nutraceutical had sufficient evidence in any anxiety-related disorder. Vitamin D (+), NAC (++), methylfolate (++) were recommended to varying degrees in the treatment of the negative symptoms in schizophrenia, while omega-3 fatty acids were not, although evidence suggests a role for prevention of transition to psychosis in high-risk youth, with potential pre-existing fatty acid deficiency. Micronutrients (+) and vitamin D (+) were weakly supported in the treatment of ADHD, while omega-3 (+/-) and omega-9 fatty acids (-), acetyl L carnitine (-), and zinc (+/-) were not supported. Phytoceuticals with supporting Grade A evidence and positive directionality included St John's wort (+++), saffron (++), curcumin (++), and lavender (+) in the treatment of unipolar depression, while rhodiola use was not supported for use in mood disorders. Ashwagandha (++), galphimia (+), and lavender (++) were modestly supported in the treatment of anxiety disorders, while kava (-) and chamomile (+/-) were not recommended for generalised anxiety disorder. Ginkgo was weakly supported in the adjunctive treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia (+), but not supported in the treatment of ADHD (+/-). With respect to safety and tolerability, all interventions were deemed to have varying acceptable levels of safety and tolerability for low-risk over-the-counter use in most circumstances. Quality and standardisation of phytoceuticals was also raised by the taskforce as a key limiting issue for firmer confidence in these agents. Finally, the taskforce noted that such use of nutraceuticals or phytoceuticals be primarily recommended (where supportive evidence exists) adjunctively within a standard medical/health professional care model, especially in cases of more severe mental illness. Some meta-analyses reviewed contained data from heterogenous studies involving poor methodology. Isolated RCTs and other data such as open label or case series were not included, and it is recognised that an absence of data does not imply lack of efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current data and clinician input, a range of nutraceuticals and phytoceuticals were given either a supportive recommendation or a provisional recommendation across a range of various psychiatric disorders. However several had only a weak endorsement for potential use; for a few it was not possible to reach a clear recommendation direction, largely due to mixed study findings; while some other agents showed no obvious therapeutic benefit and were clearly not recommended for use. It is the intention of these guidelines to inform psychiatric/medical, and health professional practice globally.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sarris J ; Ravindran A ; Yatham LN ; Marx W ; Rucklidge JJ ; McIntyre RS ; Akhondzadeh S ; Benedetti F ; Caneo C ; Cramer H ; Cribb L ; de Manincor M ; Dean O ; Deslandes AC ; Freeman MP ; Gangadhar B ; Harvey BH ; Kasper S ; Lake J ; Lopresti A ; Lu L ; Metri NJ ; Mischoulon D ; Ng CH ; Nishi D ; Rahimi R ; Seedat S ; Sinclair J ; Su KP ; Zhang ZJ ; Berk M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15622975.2021.2013041 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nHumans\r\n*Biological Psychiatry\r\nCanada\r\n*Mental Disorders/drug therapy\r\nAnxiety\r\nDietary Supplements\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3\r\nVitamin D\r\nZinc\r\nADHD\r\nNutrients\r\naffective disorders\r\nherbal medicines\r\nschizophrenia","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sarris J, Ravindran A, Yatham LN, Marx W, Rucklidge JJ, McIntyre RS, Akhondzadeh S, Benedetti F, Caneo C, Cramer H, Cribb L, de Manincor M, Dean O, Deslandes AC, Freeman MP, Gangadhar B, Harvey BH, Kasper S, Lake J, Lopresti A, Lu L, Metri NJ, Mischoulon D, Ng CH, Nishi D, Rahimi R, Seedat S, Sinclair J, Su KP, Zhang ZJ, and Berk M (2022) Clinician guidelines for the treatment of psychiatric disorders with nutraceuticals and phytoceuticals: The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce..

Lithium is the mainstay of treatment for this illness, with robust acute antimanic and long-term prophylactic effects. Over the past decade, valproate has been another medication shown to have possibly similar mood-stabilising properties to lithium, in double-blind controlled trials. Nonetheless, among patients suffering from bipolar disorder, a substantial percentage appears to respond poorly to currently available pharmacological therapies, including lithium, valproate, carbamazepine and other newer compounds, clearly demonstrating that there is a substantial need for improved therapeutic agents. Very significant effort has been made in the past several years to elucidate the cellular mechanisms by which lithium and valproate produce their therapeutic effects. The available evidence points to a modulatory action of these compounds over multiple neural biochemical pathways and most investigations have found relevant actions of mood stabilisers on intracellular signal transduction mechanisms. Moreover, it has been shown in recent years that lithium and valproate lead to long-term changes in neural plasticity, with eventual neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects. Although these actions are not fully understood, stimulation of transcription factors and effects on gene expression are potentially involved. The search for the mechanisms of action of well-established mood-stabilisers has helped to reveal promising molecular targets to test novel therapeutic approaches. This review will examine the current investigations on the diverse biochemical and molecular pathways regulated by either lithium or valproate and highlight the potential cellular targets for the development of novel mood stabilisers.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sassi RB ; Soares JC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1517/14728222.5.5.587 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sassi RB, and Soares JC (2001) Emerging therapeutic targets in bipolar mood disorder..

Lithium is an alkali metal that is widely used for the treatment of BD. However, it is largely unknown why lithium can stabilize mood. Lithium is known to inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3 β). Interestingly, both in the glutamatergic system and GABAergic system, active GSK3 β decreases neuronal excitability, whereas inhibition of GSK3 β increases neuronal excitability, suggesting that activation of GSK3 β leads to depressive mood, and inhibition of GSK3 β leads to manic mood. The activity of GSK3β is regulated by many kinases and a phosphatase, and they are further controlled by several neurotransmitters and signaling molecules. Thus, these complicated control systems might make the swing of GSK3β activity, the swing of GSK3β activity makes the swing of neuronal excitability and finally resulting in the intrinsic swing of mood, usually observed in healthy human. BD is considered that the amplitude of the mood swing is enhanced by many factors. Lithium can dose-dependently decrease the amplitude of the swing of GSK3β activity. In addition, lithium also inhibits K(+) channel activation, leading to the elongation of refractory period, resulting in the inhibition of neuronal excitability. Therefore, in depressive mood, lithium can increase neuronal activity via the inhibition of neuronal GSK3beta activity, and in manic mood, lithium can inhibit neuronal excitability via inhibiting K(+) channel activation, therefore the amplitude of the mood swing is decreased, i.e. alleviating the depressive state and the manic state, resulting in the normalization of the mood swing.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sato K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.mehy.2021.110484 ","Keywords":"Affect\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3\r\nGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta\r\nHumans\r\n*Lithium/therapeutic use\r\nNeurons\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nGSK3β\r\nLithium\r\nMood swing","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sato K (2021) Why is lithium effective in alleviating bipolar disorder?.

Indeed depressive symptomatology represents the majority of the illness burden experienced by bipolar patients and is also associated with elevated suicide risk. The treatment of bipolar depression differs from that of recurrent major depression in that the efficacy of conventional antidepressant drugs is not well-established. Some evidence-based treatments for bipolar depression are available and include the anticonvulsant drug, lamotrigine, and the atypical antipsychotic, quetiapine. Lithium also has some benefits in the prevention of depression and its use is associated with a significant reduction in suicidal behaviour. Several other treatments are in clinical development including dopamine agonists, glutamatergic modulating drugs and antioxidants. The role of these interventions in management is uncertain. The clinical uncertainties in the pharmacological treatment of bipolar depression mean that treatment has to be individualised and empirical; there is also an important role for psychological therapies, which again need to be tailored to suit the needs of the individual patient and their family.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Saunders KE ; Goodwin GM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/7854_2012_209 ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*therapy\r\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Saunders KE, and Goodwin GM (2013) New approaches in the treatment of bipolar depression..

Atypical antipsychotics with the dual effect of blocking dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain decrease psychosis, mania, and, according to some preliminary indications, possibly depression. The impact of these properties has been borne out in clinical studies. Mood stabilizers such as lithium and valproate stabilize mood by significantly decreasing the manic and hypomanic symptoms of bipolar disorder, although they can have effects on depressive symptoms too.

In our 8-week, randomized, open-label, prospective study of 34 treatment-resistant depression patients lamotrigine-add-on was compared with lithium-augmentation. Both treatments resulted in clinically significant reduction in Hamilton rating scale for depression score: mean Hamilton rating scale for depression-score declined from 22.7 (SD 3.9) to 11.7 (SD 4.2) in the lamotrigine group and from 21.5 (SD 3.8) to 13.3 (SD 5.7) in the lithium (Li) group. No significant differences were seen in Hamilton rating scale for depression scores between treatment groups at baseline (P=0.82) and after 8 weeks (P=0.11). Twenty-three percent of the lamotrigine group (n=4) and 18% (n=3) of the Li group achieved remission, 53% of the lamotrigine group (n=9) responded to treatment vs. 41% in the Li group (n=7) and 47% of the lamotrigine group (n=8) vs. 35% of the Li group (n=6) showed at least a partial response. Lamotrigine-augmentation was well tolerated. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the add-on of lamotrigine to antidepressive medication revealed comparable results in most outcome measures as a lithium augmentation. Owing to small sample size no conclusions regarding similar efficacy can be drawn from our data. Larger trials that should include a placebo arm are needed to further investigate lamotriginés role in treatment-resistant depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schindler F ; Anghelescu IG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/YIC.0b013e328014823d ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnticonvulsants/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nAntimanic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nGermany\r\nHospitalization\r\nHumans\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLithium Carbonate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nTriazines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schindler F, and Anghelescu IG (2007) Lithium versus lamotrigine augmentation in treatment resistant unipolar depression: a randomized, open-label study..

They are characterized by depressed mood, a diminished interest in pleasurable activities, feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt, decrease in appetite and libido, insomnia, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Among other findings, reduced activity of monoaminergic neurotransmission has been postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of depression. Consistent with this hypothesis, most antidepressive drugs exert their action by elevating the concentration of monoamines in the synaptic cleft. However, it is not the enhancement of monoaminergic signaling per se, but rather long-term, adaptive changes that may underlie the therapeutic effect. These include functional and structural changes that are discussed later. In addition, in the last years, evidence has emerged that remissions induced in patients using lithium or electroconvulsive therapy are accompanied by structural changes in neuronal networks thereby affecting synaptic plasticity in various regions of the brain.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schloss P ; Henn FA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pharmthera.2004.02.001 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBiogenic Monoamines/metabolism\r\nBrain/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nDepressive Disorder/metabolism/physiopathology/therapy\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nMembrane Transport Proteins/metabolism\r\nNeuronal Plasticity","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schloss P, and Henn FA (2004) New insights into the mechanisms of antidepressant therapy..

Accurate diagnosis is essential because the treatment of unipolar disorders is markedly different from that of bipolar disorders. Aggressive treatment of mood disorders improves quality of life, reduces morbidity and mortality, and may prevent worsening of both psychiatric and neurologic disease. Antidepressants and psychotherapy are both effective for patients suffering from depressive disorders. Choice of antidepressant depends on the patient's particular symptom complex; medication side effects, which may exacerbate the underlying neurologic condition; potential interactions with other drugs; and costs. Bipolar disorder associated with neurologic illness typically requires treatment with mood stabilizers such as lithium, divalproex sodium, carbamazepine, or verapamil. Although psychotherapy in combination with pharmacologic therapy improves the outcome in bipolar illness, psychotherapy alone is not effective for this condition. Electroconvulsive therapy is an effective treatment for both depression and mania. It may have particular usefulness in Parkinson's disease, for which it has been shown to improve the movement disorder itself. Treatment of bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, or refractory depression is complicated and should be referred to a psychiatrist.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schneck CD ; Buzan RD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11940-000-0016-z ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schneck CD, and Buzan RD (2000) Mood Disorders in Neurologic Illness..

METHOD: Forty-six patients suffering from unipolar depression (major depressive episode according to DSM-IV criteria) were pre-treated with mirtazapine for 2 weeks initially (week -2 to week 0). Thereafter, the patients received either continuation of mirtazapine monotherapy (n = 23), combination treatment with mirtazapine and lithium (n = 13), or combination therapy with mirtazapine and carbamazepine (n = 10) for further 3 weeks (week 0 to week 3). Severity of depression was estimated weekly using the 21-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (21-HAMD). Response was defined by a reduction of at least 50% in the 21-HAMD sum score after 3 weeks of pharmacotherapy (week 0-3). RESULTS: Additional administration of lithium, but not adjunctive carbamazepine significantly augmented the antidepressant efficacy of mirtazapine in the unipolar depressed patients. Moreover, carbamazepine but not lithium significantly lowered the serum concentrations of mirtazapine. CONCLUSION: Whereas the clinical importance of anticonvulsants in the treatment of bipolar disorder is not in doubt, the therapeutic efficacy of antiepileptic drugs such as carbamazepine is obviously limited in the pharmacotherapy of unipolar depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schüle C ; Baghai TC ; Eser D ; Nothdurfter C ; Rupprecht R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15622970701849978 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAnticonvulsants/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/*administration & dosage/adverse \r\n      effects/pharmacokinetics\r\nAntimanic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics\r\nBiological Availability\r\nCarbamazepine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics\r\nMale\r\nMetabolic Clearance Rate\r\nMianserin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & \r\n      derivatives/pharmacokinetics\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMirtazapine\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schüle C, Baghai TC, Eser D, Nothdurfter C, and Rupprecht R (2009) Lithium but not carbamazepine augments antidepressant efficacy of mirtazapine in unipolar depression: an open-label study..

Augmentation therapy is defined as the addition of a second agent to an existing antidepressant regimen with the aim of achieving improved clinical response. METHOD: The available literature which related specifically to currently popular augmentation strategies in treatment resistant depression for the past 20 years was examined. The scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of these regimens and their safety was reviewed. RESULTS: Considerable research on lithium augmentation has been undertaken, and on triiodothyronine augmentation to a lesser degree. A number of other drugs have been trialed as augmentation agents with claims of success; however, most of the evidence supporting these agents is anecdotal and in the form of case reports. There are very few well-performed double-blind placebo-controlled studies of augmentation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Because of possible complex pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions, augmentation therapy is not without its potential complications. Lithium augmentation of tricyclic antidepressants can be recommended as a safe and effective strategy and there is a body of scientific evidence supporting the addition of T3 as an effective augmentation agent. Recent research with pindolol augmentation of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is encouraging, but these findings require replication. There is no empirical evidence supporting buspirone, carbamazepine, sodium valproate, methylphenidate or amphetamine as effective augmentation agents, or that adding a tricyclic to a SSRI has usefulness in relieving depressive symptoms. There is a need for considerable research in this area, with more prospective well-controlled placebo studies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schweitzer I ; Tuckwell V ; Johnson G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3109/00048679709073843 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/therapeutic use\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use\r\nThyrotropin/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schweitzer I, Tuckwell V, and Johnson G (1997) A review of the use of augmentation therapy for the treatment of resistant depression: implications for the clinician..

The BPIs received lithium during the 4 week period with a goal of achieving therapeutic blood levels of >0.5 mEq/L (mean level 0.67 mEq/L). Mood symptoms were rated with the Hamilton Depression and the Young Mania Rating Scales at baseline and after 4 weeks, and response was defined as >50% decrease on either scale. Hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal (PFC), dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) volumes were obtained by Freesurfer image analysis suite. According to baseline symptoms and treatment response, patients were assigned to three groups: euthymics (n=6), responders (n=12) and non-responders (n=6). Taken over both time periods, non-responders had smaller right amygdala than healthy comparisons and euthymic BPI (p=0.035 and p=0.003, respectively). When baseline and after treatment volumes were compared, there was a significant enlargement in left PFC and left DLPFC in BPI who responded to treatment (p=0.002 and p=0.006, respectively). Left hippocampus and right ACC volumes decreased in non-responders (p=0.02 and p=0.0001, respectively). According to the findings decreased left hippocampus and right ACC volumes may be markers of non-response to lithium amongst BPI. Smaller right amygdala may reflect symptomatic remission and be a marker of treatment non-response. Increases in left PFC and left DLPFC as a result of lithium treatment may relate to lithium's neurotrophic effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Selek S ; Nicoletti M ; Zunta-Soares GB ; Hatch JP ; Nery FG ; Matsuo K ; Sanches M ; Soares JC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2013.04.020 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAffect\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*physiopathology\r\nFemale\r\nGyrus Cinguli/*drug effects/physiopathology\r\nHippocampus/*drug effects/physiopathology\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\r\nMale\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nHippocampus\r\nLithium\r\nPrefrontal cortex","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Selek S, Nicoletti M, Zunta-Soares GB, Hatch JP, Nery FG, Matsuo K, Sanches M, and Soares JC (2013) A longitudinal study of fronto-limbic brain structures in patients with bipolar I disorder during lithium treatment..

A variety of neuromuscular and psychiatric symptoms, including different types of depression, was observed in magnesium deficiency. Plasma/serum magnesium levels do not seem to be the appropriate indicators of depressive disorders, since ambiguous outcomes, depending on the study, were obtained. The emergence of a new approach to magnesium compounds in medical practice has been seen. Apart from being administered as components of dietary supplements, they are also perceived as the effective agents in treatment of migraine, alcoholism, asthma, heart diseases, arrhythmias, renal calcium stones, premenstrual tension syndrome etc. Magnesium preparations have an essential place in homeopathy as a remedy for a range of mental health problems. Mechanisms of antidepressant action of magnesium are not fully understood yet. Most probably, magnesium influences several systems associated with development of depression. The first information on the beneficial effect of magnesium sulfate given hypodermically to patients with agitated depression was published almost 100 years ago.

It also plays a vital modulatory role in brain biochemistry, influencing several neurotransmission pathways associated with the development of depression. Personality changes, including apathy, depression, agitation, confusion, anxiety, and delirium are observed when there is a deficiency of this element. Rodents receiving a diet deficient in magnesium displayed depressive behaviour that was reversed by antidepressant drugs. Poor nutrition, gastrointestinal and renal diseases, insulin resistance and/or type 2 diabetes, alcoholism, stress, and certain medications may lead to magnesium deficiency. Since the extracellular concentration of magnesium ions may not reflect their intracellular level, none of the current methods of evaluating magnesium status is regarded as satisfactory. The mood-improving potential of magnesium compounds have been confirmed by the results of numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies. It seems that magnesium supplementation is well-tolerated and enhances the efficacy of conventional antidepressant treatments, and as such could be a valuable addition to the standard treatments for depression, although differences in bioavailability between inorganic and organic compounds should be taken into consideration.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Serefko A ; Szopa A ; Poleszak E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1684/mrh.2016.0407 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nDepression/*diet therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\nMagnesium/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nMagnesium Deficiency/diet therapy/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nantidepressant therapy\r\ndepression\r\nmagnesium","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Serefko A, Szopa A, and Poleszak E (2016) Magnesium and depression..

It also imposes a heavy economic burden on society. It has been shown that between 29% and 46% of depressed patients fail to respond adequately to antidepressant medication. Treatment-resistant depression may contribute to the morbidity and mortality associated with affective illness. When treatment resistance is suspected, the patient's history should be reevaluated particularly regarding diagnostic subtypes and comorbidity. An assessment of treatment adequacy in terms of dose, duration and compliance should also be made. Treatment strategies for treatment-resistant depression should be systematic and empirically grounded because of the risk of increased resistance and loss of time in case of a random trial-and-error approach, and the inherent risks in certain novel strategies. A stepped care approach to treatment-resistant depression involves optimization of the current drug under trial, augmentation with drugs such as lithium and triiodothyronine, and switching to other somatic therapies such as electroconvulsive therapy and monoamine inhibitors. Only if these strategies fail, should novel treatments such as the use of venlafaxine, antidepressant combinations and augmentation with sleep deprivation be considered. Experimental strategies such as the use of antiglucocorticoids and sex hormones, which carry considerable risk, should be restricted to research settings. Somatotherapy should be combined in all cases with depression-specific psychotherapy. Psychosurgery should be considered only in truly intractable cases. Rational and energetic treatment can adequately help a large majority of patients with treatment-resistant depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sharan P ; Saxena S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAged\r\nChild\r\nDepression/*therapy\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sharan P, and Saxena S (1998) Treatment-resistant depression: clinical significance, concept and management..

Valproate, one such anticonvulsant, has been found to be effective in the treatment of acute mania, mixed states and rapid cycling disorders. This paper presents the results of an open study with combination therapy of valproate and lithium in a series of nine patients (mean age = 50 years). These patients had previously been treated with various psychotropic agents, including a combination of carbamazepine and lithium. All but one patient showed marked or moderate improvement in their condition. Of particular interest was the observation that in three patients there was evidence of augmentation between valproate and lithium during the depressed phase of their illness. There was significant improvement in their depression within 24 to 48 hours of the addition of lithium to valproate. The combination therapy was very well-tolerated. It is concluded that valproate and lithium combination therapy provides a safe and effective alternative for the treatment of rapid cycling variant of bipolar illness.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sharma V ; Persad E ; Mazmanian D ; Karunaratne K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/070674379303800213 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nValproic Acid/*administration & dosage/adverse effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sharma V, Persad E, Mazmanian D, and Karunaratne K (1993) Treatment of rapid cycling bipolar disorder with combination therapy of valproate and lithium..

Mood disorders, especially major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder, are the most common psychiatric conditions associated with suicide. Primary (psychiatric and physical illness), secondary (psychosocial), and tertiary (demographic) risk factors for suicide have been identified. Comorbid psychiatric illness, particularly anxiety symptoms or disorders, significantly increase the risk of suicidal behavior. Current standard risk assessments and precautions may be of limited value, while assessing the severity of anxiety and agitation may be more effective in identifying patients at risk. Lithium is the medication that has most consistently demonstrated an antisuicidal effect. The effects of antidepressants and conventional antipsychotics on suicide risk are uncertain, but atypical antipsychotics appear promising. Atypical antipsychotics have beneficial effects on depressed mood both in patients with MDD and in patients with bipolar disorder. In addition, data in patients with schizophrenia have demonstrated a significant improvement in the incidence of suicidal behavior with clozapine compared with olanzapine. Electroconvulsive therapy appears to have an acute benefit on suicidality.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sharma V ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1399-2406.2003.00062.x ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety Disorders/*complications/drug therapy\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nMood Disorders/*complications/drug therapy\r\nRisk Factors\r\n*Suicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sharma V (2003) Atypical antipsychotics and suicide in mood and anxiety disorders..

METHODS: Three electronic databases, MEDLINE/PubMed (1966-2016), PsycINFO (1806-2016), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, were searched using a combination of the keywords bipolar, depression, postpartum, peripartum, prevalence, screening, diagnosis, treatment, drugs, and psychotherapy. The reference lists of articles identified were also searched. All relevant articles published in English were included. RESULTS: Depending on the population studied, 21.4-54% of women with PPD have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD). Characteristic clinical features include younger age at illness onset, first onset of depression after childbirth, onset immediately after delivery, atypical depressive symptoms, psychotic features, mixed features, and history of BD in first-degree family members. Treatment should be guided by symptom acuity, safety concerns, the patient's response to past treatments, drug tolerability, and breastfeeding preference. In the absence of controlled treatment data, preference should be given to drugs normally indicated for bipolar depression including lithium, quetiapine and lamotrigine. Although antidepressants have been studied in combination with mood stabilizers in bipolar depression, these drugs should be avoided due to likelihood of elevated risk of induction of manic symptoms in the postpartum period. CONCLUSIONS: In the postpartum period, bipolar PPD is common, can be differentiated from unipolar PPD, and needs to be identified promptly in order to expedite appropriate treatment.

Pre-conception counseling should be an integral part of the overall plan to manage bipolar disorder during and after pregnancy. Peripartum management of bipolar disorder is challenging and requires balancing of risks associated with the use of drugs and the potentially deleterious effects of untreated bipolar disorder on the fetus/child. Formulation of personalized treatment requires knowledge of both current (episode type, symptom severity, psychiatric comorbidity, and safety concerns) and historical (episode frequency, response to drugs and psychotherapy, and the effect of reproductive events including pregnancy and postpartum period) factors. Close monitoring is essential for early detection and management of mood episodes.

It affects both sexes equally in all age groups and its worldwide prevalence is approximately 3-5%. The clinical course of illness can vary from a mild depression to a severe form of mania. The condition has a high rate of recurrence and if untreated, it has an approximately 15% risk of death by suicide. It is the third leading cause of death among people aged 15-24 years and is a burden on society and families. The pathophysiology of the disorder is poorly understood. However, a variety of imaging studies suggests the involvement of structural abnormalities in the amygdala, basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex. There are two main biological models that have been proposed for depression. These are called the serotonin and norepinephrine hypotheses. Multiple lines of evidence support both of them. It is a life-long disease and runs in families but has a complex mode of inheritance. Family, twin and adoption studies suggest genetic factors but the candidate susceptibility genes, which when mutated can account for a substantial portion of BPD patients, have not yet been conclusively identified. There have been an increasing number of new generation antidepressant drugs developed to treat BPD. However, lithium salt is only the drug that is most efficient in long-term preventive treatment and it also has an anti-suicidal effect. The condition can be well managed by physicians and psychiatrists along with family and patient education. Identification of risk genes in the future may provide a better understanding of the nature of pathogenesis that may lead to a better therapeutic target.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shastry BS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuint.2004.10.007 ","Keywords":"Age of Onset\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBiogenic Monoamines/metabolism\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/genetics/*physiopathology\r\nGenetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics\r\nHumans\r\nLimbic System/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nSuicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shastry BS (2005) Bipolar disorder: an update..

There is no universally accepted definition of TRD, but results from the US National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) STAR*D (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression) programme indicate that after the failure of two treatment trials, the chances of remission decrease significantly. Several pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments for TRD may be considered when optimized (adequate dose and duration) therapy has not produced a successful outcome and a patient is classified as resistant to treatment. Nonpharmacological strategies include psychotherapy (often in conjunction with pharmacotherapy), electroconvulsive therapy and vagus nerve stimulation. The US FDA recently approved vagus nerve stimulation as adjunctive therapy (after four prior treatment failures); however, its benefits are seen only after prolonged (up to 1 year) use. Other nonpharmacological options, such as repetitive transcranial stimulation, deep brain stimulation or psychosurgery, remain experimental and are not widely available. Pharmacological treatments of TRD can be grouped in two main categories: 'switching' or 'combining'. In the first, treatment is switched within and between classes of compounds. The benefits of switching include avoidance of polypharmacy, a narrower range of treatment-emergent adverse events and lower costs. An inherent disadvantage of any switching strategy is that partial treatment responses resulting from the initial treatment might be lost by its discontinuation in favour of another medication trial. Monotherapy switches have also been shown to have limited effectiveness in achieving remission. The advantage of combination strategies is the potential to build upon achieved improvements; they are generally recommended if partial response was achieved with the current treatment trial. Various non-antidepressant augmenting agents, such as lithium and thyroid hormones, are well studied, although not commonly used. There is also evidence of efficacy and increasing use of atypical antipsychotics in combination with antidepressants, for example, olanzapine in combination with fluoxetine (OFC) or augmentation with aripiprazole. The disadvantages of a combination strategy include multiple medications, a broader range of treatment-emergent adverse events and higher costs. Several experimental pharmaceutical treatment alternatives for TRD are also being explored in combination with antidepressants or as monotherapy. These less studied alternative compounds include pindolol, inositol, CNS stimulants, hormones, herbal supplements, omega-3 fatty acids, S-adenosyl-L-methionine, folic acid, lamotrigine, modafinil, riluzole and topiramate. In summary, despite an increasing variety of choices for the treatment of TRD, this condition remains universally undefined and represents an area of unmet medical need. There are few known approved pharmacological agents for TRD (aripiprazole and OFC) and overall outcomes remain poor. This might be an indication that depression itself is a heterogeneous condition with a great diversity of pathologies, highlighting the need for careful evaluation of individuals with depressive symptoms who are unresponsive to treatment. Clearly, more research is needed to provide clinicians with better guidance in making those treatment decisions--especially in light of accumulating evidence that the longer patients are unsuccessfully treated, the worse their long-term prognosis tends to be.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shelton RC ; Osuntokun O ; Heinloth AN ; Corya SA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2165/11530280-000000000-00000 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDeep Brain Stimulation\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/*therapy\r\n*Drug Resistance\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nPsychotherapy\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/*administration & dosage\r\nTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVagus Nerve Stimulation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shelton RC, Osuntokun O, Heinloth AN, and Corya SA (2010) Therapeutic options for treatment-resistant depression..

Alcohol abuse may lead to the deficiency of micronutrients including selenium, an essential trace element. In addition, dietary intake of selenium in some geographic areas is low. The combination of these two factors may result in significant selenium deficiency. Selenium plays an important role in brain function. Selenium is a potent protective agent for neurons through the expression of selenoproteins. Studies suggest that low selenium status is associated with depressed mood, anxiety, and cognitive decline. A tremendous amount of structural and functional brain development takes place during the teenage years. Many of the changes that take place during the second decade of life are novel and do not simply represent the remnants of childhood plasticity. Considerable evidence suggests that alcohol affects brain function and behavior differently during adolescence than during adulthood. Adolescents are more vulnerable to the long-term effects of alcohol abuse. The adolescent brain may be especially sensitive to a harmful combination of alcohol abuse and selenium deficiency. This combination may contribute to depression and suicidal behavior in adolescents. Recent research opens new avenues for the potential development of selenium containing compounds as preventive or therapeutic agents in psychiatric and neurological conditions. Healthy nutrition and possibly mineral supplementations should be a part of the treatment plan of adolescents with alcohol use disorders especially when alcohol misuse is comorbid with depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sher L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAlcoholism/*complications/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nAntioxidants/*metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*chemically induced/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSelenium/*deficiency/*therapeutic use\r\nSuicide, Attempted/prevention & control\r\nTrace Elements/deficiency/therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\n*Suicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sher L (2008) Depression and suicidal behavior in alcohol abusing adolescents: possible role of selenium deficiency..

Several pharmacological strategies have been suggested to treat such refractory depression. There has been no survey of United Kingdom psychiatrists' treatment preferences for refractory depression. This study was carried out to determine both experience and preference of various strategies for management of refractory depression. METHOD: A total of 300 fellows, members and inceptors of the Royal College of Psychiatrists were randomly selected and approached by postal questionnaire. They were asked to comment on management of a detailed clinical vignette of a case of depression with initial treatment failure. RESULTS: The response rate was 63% (n = 175). The most popular treatment choices were increasing dosage of tricyclic medication and change of medication of SSRI. The most rarely selected were augmentation with triiodothyronine (T3) and augmentation with tryptophan or MAOIs. Treatment choice was significantly influenced by previous experience. A large number (39%) of psychiatrists were not confident in treating refractory depression. CONCLUSION: Surprisingly few psychiatrists chose to use the best proven pharmacological treatments such as augmentation with lithium or T3. In view of this and the considerable proportion of psychiatrists lacking confidence in the management of refractory depression, this topic deserves priority as a topic for continuing professional development (CPD) courses.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shergill SS ; Katona CL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0165-0327(96)00100-0 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\n*Attitude of Health Personnel\r\nDepressive Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nDrug Utilization\r\nEngland\r\nHumans\r\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Failure\r\nTriiodothyronine/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nTryptophan/adverse effects/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shergill SS, and Katona CL (1997) Pharmacological choices after one antidepressant fails: a survey of UK psychiatrists..

A proven strategy for managing this refractory depression is lithium augmentation. The long-term outcome and optimal management of patients treated with lithium augmentation remains unclear. We describe a 4-8 year naturalistic follow-up of patients treated with lithium augmentation in two controlled studies of its efficacy in refractory depression. METHOD: Cases were followed up with personal interview where possible, and by telephone and general practitioner contact otherwise. Lifetime clinical status was ascertained using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Lifetime (SADS-L). RESULTS: We obtained outcome data on 53 of the original eligible 76 patients. There was a good outcome in 38 (72%) patients. Good outcome was associated with a less endogenous nature of depression and an absence of previous hospitalisations. CONCLUSIONS: There do not seem to be any specific prognostic indicators of long-term outcome to lithium augmentation beyond those recognised to be relevant in the outcome of depression generally.

METHODS: The questionnaire, amended on the basis of KMAP-BP 2006 and new data, was sent to 94 experts, 65 of whom replied. RESULTS: In an acute manic episode, a combination of a mood stabilizer (MS) with an atypical antipsychotic (AAP) is recommended as first-line strategy. Monotherapy with MS is first-line in a hypomanic episode. Triple combination of a MS, an AAP, and an antidepressant (AD), is the first-line strategy in non-psychotic severe depression. Also MS+AAP and MS+AD are recommended as first-line. In psychotic bipolar depression, MS+AAP+AD, MS+AAP and AAP+AD are first-line strategies. In bipolar depression, lithium, lamotrigine and valproic acid are selected as first-line MS and quetiapine, olanzapine and aripiprazole are preferred antipsychotics. In maintenance treatment, a combination of MS with AAP and monotherapy of MS are recommended as first-line.

METHOD: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled selenium therapy (200 microg/day) trial was conducted in HIV+ drug users from 1998-2000. Psychosocial measures (STAI-State and Trait anxiety, BDI-depression, and POMS- mood state), clinical status (CD4 cell count, viral load), and plasma selenium levels were determined at baseline and compared with measurements obtained at the 12-month evaluation in 63 participants (32 men, 31 women). RESULTS: The majority of the study participants reported elevated levels of both State (68%) and Trait (70%) anxiety. Approximately 25% reported overall mood distress (POMS > 60) and moderate depression (BDI > 20). Psychological burden was not influenced by current drug use, antiretroviral treatment, or viral load. At the 12-month evaluation, participants who received selenium reported increased vigor (p = 0.004) and had less anxiety (State, p = 0.05 and Trait, p = 0.02), compared to the placebo-treated individuals. No apparent selenium-related affect on depression or distress was observed. The risk for state anxiety was almost four times higher, and nearly nine times greater for trait anxiety in the placebo-treated group, controlling for antiretroviral therapy, CD4 cell decline (> 50 cells) and years of education. CONCLUSIONS: Selenium therapy may be a beneficial treatment to decrease anxiety in HIV+ drug users who exhibit a high prevalence of psychological burden.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shor-Posner G ; Lecusay R ; Miguez MJ ; Moreno-Black G ; Zhang G ; Rodriguez N ; Burbano X ; Baum M ; Wilkie F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2190/PFFD-D920-V041-N5KD ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntioxidants/*administration & dosage\r\nAntiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active\r\nAnxiety/etiology/*prevention & control\r\nCD4 Lymphocyte Count\r\n*Cost of Illness\r\nDepression/etiology/*prevention & control\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nFlorida\r\nHIV Infections/blood/*drug therapy/etiology/*psychology\r\nHIV-1/drug effects\r\nHumans\r\nLogistic Models\r\nMale\r\nMicronutrients/*administration & dosage/blood\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMood Disorders/etiology/*prevention & control\r\nPrevalence\r\nSelenium/*administration & dosage/blood\r\nSubstance Abuse, Intravenous/complications/virology\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shor-Posner G, Lecusay R, Miguez MJ, Moreno-Black G, Zhang G, Rodriguez N, Burbano X, Baum M, and Wilkie F (2003) Psychological burden in the era of HAART: impact of selenium therapy..

In 1970, the United States became the 50th country to admit lithium to the marketplace. Meanwhile, interest in lithium for the prophylaxis of depression was growing apace and today the agent is widely prescribed for that indication, even though it has not been accepted by the Food and Drug Administration.

We examined the safety and behavioral effects of combined chronic low-dose aspirin plus low-dose Li in rats to explore the toxicity and therapeutic potential of this treatment. Rats were fed regular or Li-containing food (0.1% [low-dose, LLD-Li] or 0.2% [standard-dose, STD-Li]) for six weeks. Low-dose aspirin (1 mg/kg) was administered alone or together with Li. Renal function and gastric mucosal integrity were assessed. The effects of the combination treatment were evaluated in depression-like and anxiety-like behavioral models. Co-treatment with aspirin did not alter plasma Li levels. Chronic STD-Li treatment resulted in significant polyuria and polydipsia, elevated blood levels of creatinine and cystatin C, and increased levels of kidney nephrin and podocin-all suggestive of impaired renal function. Aspirin co-treatment significantly damped STD-Li-induced impairments in kidney parameters. There were no gastric ulcers or blood loss in any treatment group. Combined aspirin and LLD-Li resulted in a significant increase in sucrose consumption, and in the time spent in the open arms of an elevated plus-maze compared with the LLD-Li only group, suggestive of antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects, respectively. Thus, we demonstrate that low-dose aspirin mitigated the typical renal side effects of STD-Li dose and enhanced the beneficial behavioral effects of LLD-Li therapy without aggravating its toxicity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shvartsur R ; Agam G ; Shnaider A ; Uzzan S ; Nassar A ; Jabarin A ; Abu-Freha N ; Meir K ; Azab AN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/pharmaceutics13111827 ","Keywords":"aspirin\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ninflammation\r\nlithium\r\nnephrotoxicity","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shvartsur R, Agam G, Shnaider A, Uzzan S, Nassar A, Jabarin A, Abu-Freha N, Meir K, and Azab AN (2021) Safety and Efficacy of Combined Low-Dose Lithium and Low-Dose Aspirin: A Pharmacological and Behavioral Proof-of-Concept Study in Rats..

Although children with ASD may experience irritability (aggression, self-injury, and tantrums), a portion also experience symptoms that are typical of a mood disorder, such as euphoria/elevated mood, mania, hypersexuality, paranoia, or decreased need for sleep. Despite lithium's established efficacy in controlling mood disorder symptoms in the neurotypical population, lithium has been rarely studied in children with ASD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 30 children and adolescents diagnosed with ASD by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria who were prescribed lithium in order to assess target symptoms, safety, and tolerability. Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement (CGI-I) ratings were performed by two board-certified child psychiatrists with expertise in ASD. CGI-I scores were dichotomized into \"improved\" (CGI-I score of 1 or 2) or \"not improved\" (CGI-I score ≥3). RESULTS: Forty-three percent of patients who received lithium were rated as \"improved\" on the CGI-I. Seventy-one percent of patients who had two or more pretreatment mood disorder symptoms were rated as \"improved.\" The presence of mania (p=0.033) or euphoria/elevated mood (p=0.041) were the pretreatment symptoms significantly associated with an \"improved\" rating. The mean lithium blood level was 0.70 mEq/L (SD=0.26), and the average length of lithium treatment was 29.7 days (SD=23.9). Forty-seven percent of patients were reported to have at least one side effect, most commonly vomiting (13%), tremor (10%), fatigue (10%), irritability (7%), and enuresis (7%). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary assessment of lithium in children and adolescents with ASD suggests that lithium may be a medication of interest for those who exhibit two or more mood disorder symptoms, particularly mania or euphoria/elevated mood. A relatively high side effect rate merits caution, and these results are limited by the retrospective, uncontrolled study design. Future study of lithium in a prospective trial with treatment-sensitive outcome measures may be indicated.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Siegel M ; Beresford CA ; Bunker M ; Verdi M ; Vishnevetsky D ; Karlsson C ; Teer O ; Stedman A ; Smith KA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1089/cap.2014.0019 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nChild\r\nChild Development Disorders, Pervasive/complications/*drug therapy\r\nChild, Preschool\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMood Disorders/complications/*drug therapy\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nSymptom Assessment\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Siegel M, Beresford CA, Bunker M, Verdi M, Vishnevetsky D, Karlsson C, Teer O, Stedman A, and Smith KA (2014) Preliminary investigation of lithium for mood disorder symptoms in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder..

One tactic has been to develop compounds with greater neuropharmacological selectivity in inhibiting the neuronal reuptake of 5-HT. Most of these are as effective as TCA but with fewer side-effects and greater safety. Another development has been 'reversible' MAOI which reduce the risk of interaction with tyramine-containing foods. For resistant depression the addition of lithium (and/or tryptophan) may be effective, possibly through promoting 5-HT neurotransmission. Continuous treatment with a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor can reduce the relapse rate in patients with recurrent depression. Unfortunately, these new approaches, despite their advantages in terms of side-effects and safety, have thus far not proved to be more effective or faster acting than the standard TCA. That remains a challenge for the future.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Silverstone T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00004850-199206005-00004 ","Keywords":"Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nHumans\r\nLong-Term Care\r\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nRecurrence\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Silverstone T (1992) New aspects in the treatment of depression..

The major objective of long term treatment is to reduce the frequency of these episodes. Lithium is the most widely recommended drug for this purpose, having been shown in controlled clinical trials to be more effective than placebo in reducing the likelihood of relapse. Unfortunately, its effectiveness in clinical practice is less than that predicted from these trials. A major cause of relapse is noncompliance, largely due to intolerance to adverse effects such as perceived mental sluggishness, thirst, polyuria and weight gain. Regular monitoring of lithium plasma concentrations is required to ensure that the range of 0.5 to 0.9 mmol/L is not exceeded. Concentrations above this can lead to toxic symptoms, which if unchecked can cause brain damage and even death. The anticonvulsant drugs carbamazepine and valproic acid (sodium valproate) are potential alternatives to lithium. Patients who relapse frequently despite lithium may benefit from the addition of one of these agents, although formal clinical trial evidence of the efficacy of such combination treatment is lacking. Antipsychotics, administered as a depot formulation, can reduce the likelihood of relapse in patients with frequent manic episodes, especially if associated with poor compliance. Psychological treatment and patient education have been shown to improve outcome, and should be made more widely available to all patients with bipolar disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Silverstone T ; Romans S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2165/00003495-199651030-00003 ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/adverse effects/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Silverstone T, and Romans S (1996) Long term treatment of bipolar disorder..

Additionally, there is a significant risk of suicide in bipolar patients when depressed. The treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder is therefore a matter of some priority. Here, we review current evidence supporting the use of five groups of treatments: anti-depressants; lithium; anti-convulsants (valproate, and carbamazepine, lamotrigine, gabapentin); anti-psychotics; and other treatments (electroconvulsive therapy, benzodiazepines, sleep-deprivation, and dopamine agonists). From this review, it is apparent that the literature regarding the treatment of bipolar depression is significantly limited in several key areas. Nonetheless, from the evidence currently available, the treatments with the best evidence for efficacy are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and lamotrigine. There is also some evidence in favour of bupropion and moclobemide. Although lithium and olanzapine monotherapies can also be beneficial, they appear less efficacious than antidepressants. One of the major concerns about treatment with antidepressants has been the risk of precipitating a switch into mania. However, recent studies suggest that, if a mood stabilizer and antidepressant are given concurrently, then the risk of switching is minimized. There is also recent evidence for an independent antidepressant action for at least one atypical antipsychotic. Therefore, the conclusion from this review, in contrast to previous suggestions, is that a combination of an atypical antipsychotic and either an SSRI or lamotrigine may provide a useful first-line treatment for depressed bipolar disorder patients. Further research is clearly required to examine this approach and compare it with other possible treatment options.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Silverstone PH ; Silverstone T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00004850-200405000-00001 ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBenzodiazepines/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nDopamine Agonists/therapeutic use\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use\r\nSleep Deprivation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Silverstone PH, and Silverstone T (2004) A review of acute treatments for bipolar depression..

Furthermore, each person is physiologically different from childhood to adulthood, and in old age, thus the meaning of stabilization should take into account both growth and maturity. We aimed to review systematically studies focusing on mood stabilization in all phases of bipolar disorder (BD) and across all life phases, including pregnancy and the perinatal period, which is still a different phase in women's life cycles. METHODS: We carried out a PubMed search focusing on studies of bipolar disorder treated with drugs and aimed at stabilization with the following search strategy stabiliz*[ti] OR stabilis*[ti] OR stable[ti] OR stability[ti]) AND mood[ti] AND bipolar. In conducting our review, we followed the PRISMA statement. Agreement on inclusion was reached by consensus of all authors through a Delphi rounds procedure. RESULTS: The above search strategy produced 509 records on January 25, 2020. Of them, 58 fitted our inclusion criteria and were discussed. The eligible studies spanned from September 1983 to July 6, 2019. CONCLUSIONS: No clear-cut indications could be drawn due to a number of limitations involving sample inconsistency and different methods of assessing mood stabilization. The evidence collected so far does not allow recommended treatments for Adolescents, pregnant or perinatal women, and aged patients. However, adults, not within these groups, better focused upon. For their manic/mixed phases, second generation antipsychotic drugs may be useful in the short-to-medium run, alone or combined with mood stabilizers (MSs). However, MSs, and especially lithium, continue to be pivotal in chronic treatment. Bipolar depression should rely on MSs, but an antidepressant may be added on and can prove to be helpful. However, there are concerns with the tendency of antidepressants to induce the opposite polarity or mood instability, rendering the need for concurrent MS prescription mandatory.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Simonetti A ; Koukopoulos AE ; Kotzalidis GD ; Janiri D ; De Chiara L ; Janiri L ; Sani G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00247 ","Keywords":"antidepressant drugs\r\nantipsychotic drugs\r\nlithium\r\nmood\r\nmood stabilizers\r\nstabilization","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Simonetti A, Koukopoulos AE, Kotzalidis GD, Janiri D, De Chiara L, Janiri L, and Sani G (2020) Stabilization Beyond Mood: Stabilizing Patients With Bipolar Disorder in the Various Phases of Life..

They are heterogeneous in their mechanisms of action and in their efficacy in the various mood states in bipolar illness (Table 3). At present, evidence from well-controlled studies supports the role of DIV and CBZ in the treatment of acute mania. DIV seems to have better efficacy than lithium in mixed mania or mania associated with depressive symptoms and is recommended as a first-line pharmacologic option in acutely manic or mixed manic patients. Neither CBZ nor DIV have robust evidence supporting their efficacy in the treatment of acute bipolar depression, although DIV clearly possesses beneficial effects on depressive symptomatology and prophylaxis against depressive episodes during long-term treatment. Results from a large study indicate that LAM has significant efficacy in bipolar depression without the associated risks of cycle acceleration or manic/hypomanic switches. LAM should be considered a primary option in patients with bipolar depression and in bipolar II patients with rapid cycling. DIV is recommended as a first-line option in bipolar I patients with rapid cycling. LAM has proven efficacy in the prophylaxis of bipolar I disorder and should be considered along with lithium or DIV as treatment of choice in the long-term management of bipolar disorder. For the other anticonvulsants, including CBZ and OXC, there is still inadequate evidence of efficacy as monotherapy in the long-term management of bipolar disorder. Even less data exist for other available AEDs, and consensus is growing that someAEDs (eg, GBP) have little or no specific effect in bipolar disorder. Despite the progress made in the past decade, a wider therapeutic armamentarium is critically needed, because a large proportion of bipolar patients do not respond to acute treatments during a manic or depressive episode and have frequent relapse and recurrences during long-term treatment. As additional AEDs become available, rigorously designed and large-scale studies examining AEDs as monotherapy and AEDs in combination therapies versus placebo must be undertaken to assess efficacy and safety more adequately to provide better guidance for the clinician faced with the management of this challenging mood disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Singh V ; Muzina DJ ; Calabrese JR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.psc.2005.02.004 ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/blood/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Singh V, Muzina DJ, and Calabrese JR (2005) Anticonvulsants in bipolar disorder..

Zinc, a non competitive NMDA receptor antagonist exhibits preclinical antidepressant efficacy. Moreover, a preliminary clinical report suggests augmentation of antidepressant therapy by zinc in depression. METHODS: A placebo-controlled, double blind study of zinc supplementation in imipramine therapy was conducted in sixty, 18-55-year old, unipolar depressed patients fulfilling the DSM-IV criteria for major depression without psychotic symptoms. After a one week washout period, patients were randomized into two groups treated with imipramine (approximately 140 mg/day) and receiving once daily either placebo (n=30) or zinc supplementation (n=30, 25 mgZn/day) for 12 weeks. RESULTS: No significant differences in CGI, BDI, HADRS and MADRS scores were demonstrated between zinc-supplemented and placebo-supplemented antidepressant treatment non-resistant patients. However, zinc supplementation significantly reduced depression scores and facilitated the treatment outcome in antidepressant treatment resistant patients. CONCLUSION: Zinc supplementation augments the efficacy and speed of onset of therapeutic response to imipramine treatment, particularly in patients previously nonresponsive to antidepressant pharmacotherapies. These data suggest the participation of disturbed zinc/glutamatergic transmission in the pathophysiology of drug resistance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Siwek M ; Dudek D ; Paul IA ; Sowa-Kućma M ; Zieba A ; Popik P ; Pilc A ; Nowak G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2009.02.014 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nImipramine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/antagonists & inhibitors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nZinc/*administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Siwek M, Dudek D, Paul IA, Sowa-Kućma M, Zieba A, Popik P, Pilc A, and Nowak G (2009) Zinc supplementation augments efficacy of imipramine in treatment resistant patients: a double blind, placebo-controlled study..

AREAS COVERED: Randomized clinical trials performed with type I bipolar disorder in the years 2015 to August 2020 are reviewed. There are new indications for the use of cariprazine, for bipolar mania and depression, and a long-acting injectable formulation of aripiprazole has also been approved for relapse prevention in bipolar illness. Most of the randomized clinical trials are effectiveness studies. EXPERT OPINION: Over the 20 years from 1997 through 2016, the use of lithium and other mood stabilizers has declined by 50%, while the use of both second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and antidepressants has increased considerably. Over the same time period (1990-2017), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) increased by 54.4%, from 6.02 million in 1990 to 9.29 million in 2017 which is greater than the 47.74% increase in incidence of the disease, suggesting that the changes in prescribing patterns have not been helpful for our patients. Furthermore, recent effectiveness studies continue to confirm the superiority of lithium and other mood stabilizers in the management of bipolar illness for both psychiatric and medical outcomes, reaffirming their role as foundational treatments in the management of type I bipolar disorder. Clinicians need to reassess their prescribing habits.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sleem A ; El-Mallakh RS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/14656566.2021.1893306 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAripiprazole/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nAntidepressants\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ndepression\r\nmania\r\nmood stabilizers\r\npsychopharmacotherapy\r\ntreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sleem A, and El-Mallakh RS (2021) Advances in the psychopharmacotherapy of bipolar disorder type I..

Our study was aimed at investigating the effects of chronic lithium chloride (LiCl) administration on anxiety behavior and the expression of serotonergic genes in midbrain raphe nuclei of the affected mice. A pronounced anxiety-like state in male mice was induced by chronic social defeat stress in daily agonistic interactions. After 6 days of this stress, defeated mice were chronically treated with saline or LiCl (100 mg/kg, i.p., 2 weeks) during the continuing agonistic interactions. Anxiety was assessed by behavioral tests. RT-PCR was used to determine Tph2, Htr1a, Htr5b, and Slc6a4 mRNA expression. The results revealed anxiolytic-like effects of LiCl on social communication in the partition test and anxiogenic-like effects in both elevated plus-maze and social interaction tests. Chronic LiCl treatment upregulated serotonergic genes in midbrain raphe nuclei. Thus, LiCl effects depend on the treatment mode, psycho-emotional state of the animal, and experimental context (tests). It is assumed that increased expression of serotonergic genes is accompanied by serotonergic system activation and, as a side effect, by higher anxiety.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Smagin DA ; Kovalenko IL ; Galyamina AG ; Belozertseva IV ; Tamkovich NV ; Baranov KO ; Kudryavtseva NN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/biomedicines9101293 ","Keywords":"anxiety\r\nchronic social defeat stress\r\ndepression\r\nlithium chloride\r\nmice","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Smagin DA, Kovalenko IL, Galyamina AG, Belozertseva IV, Tamkovich NV, Baranov KO, and Kudryavtseva NN (2021) Chronic Lithium Treatment Affects Anxious Behaviors and theExpression of Serotonergic Genes in Midbrain Raphe Nuclei of Defeated Male Mice..

Valproate and clonazepam show promise in the treatment of mania and for prophylaxis, but the number of patients studied in controlled trials is small. Lorazepam and other benzodiazepines may be useful antimanic agents, and alprazolam exerts antidepressant effects, although its efficacy relative to the tricyclics is unclear. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is effective for both mania and depression. Established treatments are carbamazepine and ECT for mania and ECT for depression. Still experimental are valproate and clonazepam for mania; carbamazepine and alprazolam for depression; and carbamazepine, ECT, valproate, and clonazepam for maintenance.

Systematic reviews of randomized trials for the treatment of the maintenance phase of BD are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics in the maintenance treatment of BD. METHODS: We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials of licensed medications for the treatment of any phase of BD. We included randomized controlled trials comparing a medication to placebo or another medication. Comprehensive searches of electronic databases were conducted to March 2005. Outcomes investigated were relapse due to mania, depression or any mood episode, and withdrawal due to any reason or due to an adverse event. Data were combined through meta-analysis. RESULTS: Fourteen studies (n = 2,526) met the inclusion criteria. Lithium, lamotrigine, olanzapine and valproate semisodium each demonstrated evidence to support long-term use. Compared with placebo, all medications were more effective at preventing relapse because of any mood episode. Hazard ratios (HR) were 0.68 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53-0.86] for lithium, 0.68 (95% CI = 0.55-0.85) for lamotrigine, and 0.82 (95% CI = 0.57-1.20) for valproate semisodium; for olanzapine, the risk ratio (RR) was 0.58 (95% CI = 0.49-0.69). Lithium and olanzapine significantly reduced manic relapses (HR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.35-0.79 and RR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.24-0.57, respectively). Lamotrigine and valproate semisodium significantly reduced depressive relapses (HR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.46-0.91 and RR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.20-0.82, respectively). Lithium significantly reduced manic relapses compared with lamotrigine (HR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.34-0.92) and olanzapine significantly reduced manic relapses compared with lithium (RR = 1.69; 95% CI = 1.12-2.55). Withdrawal due to an adverse event was approximately twice as likely with lithium compared with valproate semisodium (RR = 1.81; 95% CI = 1.08-3.03) and lamotrigine (RR = 2.20; 95% CI = 1.31-3.70). There were few data for carbamazepine or medications given as adjunct therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Mood stabilizers have differing profiles of efficacy and tolerability, suggesting complementary roles in long-term maintenance treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Smith LA ; Cornelius V ; Warnock A ; Bell A ; Young AH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1399-5618.2007.00490.x ","Keywords":"Acute Disease\r\nAnticonvulsants/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use\r\n*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Smith LA, Cornelius V, Warnock A, Bell A, and Young AH (2007) Effectiveness of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics in the maintenance phase of bipolar disorder: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials..

To address concerns by clinicians about the risks of psychotropic medications, this review addresses the risk/benefit analysis of somatic therapies for psychiatric disorders during pregnancy and lactation. Areas covered: All available research was reviewed on the impact on pregnancy and breastfeeding of mood and psychotic disorders, and of antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotic drugs, and electroconvulsive therapy. References cited in other reviews, case series, formal studies, pharmacologic discussions, and theoretical pieces were added. Available case control and other studies were critically reviewed and diverse explanations for their findings were considered. Expert opinion: The potential benefits of treatment of mood and psychotic disorders often outweigh the risks after alternative therapies have been considered. Some medications, particularly paroxetine and valproate, pose greater risks during pregnancy, while the teratogenic risks of lithium have probably been overstated. There is more experience with first than with second generation antipsychotic drugs during pregnancy and lactation. Nursing an infant is possible while taking a number of antidepressants, mood stabilizers or antipsychotic drugs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Smith B ; Dubovsky SL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/14656566.2017.1391789 ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMood Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/*drug therapy\r\nPsychotic Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/therapeutic use\r\nPregnancy\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ndepression\r\nlactation\r\nmood disorders\r\npostpartum\r\npsychosis\r\npsychotropic medication\r\nschizophrenia","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Smith B, and Dubovsky SL (2017) Pharmacotherapy of mood disorders and psychosis in pre- and post-natal women..

Since then, many controlled studies have been performed, examining lithium for treatment of bipolar disorder and other psychiatric conditions. This review was undertaken to determine if the suggestion of lithium's specificity has support in the controlled studies conducted after Cade's initial proposal. Studies were selected in a Medline search, dating back to 1966 and also identified from the bibliography of some of these papers. The controlled trials with lithium for the treatment of mania and bipolar depression, unipolar depression, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorder were reviewed. The published studies with lithium in other neuropsychiatric conditions were also considered. Additionally, we reviewed literature on other therapeutic agents proposed for bipolar disorder, looking at their comparative effectiveness to lithium. The data analyzed give strong support for lithium's being most effective in bipolar disorder, with minimal or no therapeutic effects in other neuropsychiatric disorders. The neurochemical underpinnings of this specificity are being investigated, without conclusive findings to date. The study of this paradigm of specificity in neuropsychopharmacology research may lead to meaningful contributions to understanding the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder and may help to develop newer treatments for this condition.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Soares JC ; Gershon S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/S0893-133X(98)00022-0 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntimanic Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nBrain Chemistry\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Soares JC, and Gershon S (1998) The lithium ion: a foundation for psychopharmacological specificity..

Some of the new potential treatments attempt to target specific clinical conditions that constitute particular challenges in the management of bipolar individuals. Typical cases of mania traditionally respond well to lithium, but atypical cases, in particular patients with mixed episodes, tend to respond poorly. The pharmacological treatment of bipolar depression is complicated by the phenomenon of rapid cycling, which may make the clinical management of these patients considerably difficult. New therapeutic agents, including new anticonvulsants, atypical antipsychotics, and calcium channel blockers are currently being examined, and bring the promise of substantial advances in the pharmacological management of bipolar patients.

For some women, the menopausal transition can represent a time of increased vulnerability to depression, a greater risk of recurrence or instability of bipolar disorder, and an overall poorer quality of life (QOL). The physical and psychological changes of menopause and symptoms of depression may overlap, but QOL is affected doubly for women experiencing menopause-related complaints concomitantly with a unipolar or bipolar disorder. Treatments for the symptoms of menopause and for unipolar or bipolar disorder need to be chosen with careful consideration for the different stages of the menopausal transition, as well as safety, tolerability, and impact on QOL. Menopausal-related symptoms can be treated with hormonal therapies, antidepressants, and herbal supplements, but a critical window of opportunity may exist for these interventions. Bipolar disorder presents differently in women than in men and may require different medication. For instance, in women, lithium may be less effective for patients who have rapid cycling; adjuvant antidepressant medication may be required with valproate or carbamazepine; and lamotrigine may also be effective.

DATA SOURCES: Major electronic databases were searched up to September 2005. REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews were undertaken on the clinical and economic effectiveness of treatments. An analysis was performed using the methods of mixed treatment comparison (MTC) to enable indirect comparisons to be made between the treatments. An economic model of treatments for the prevention of relapse in bipolar disorder was developed. RESULTS: Forty-five trials were included in the clinical effectiveness review; all but one studied adults. This review found that for the prevention of all relapses, lithium, valproate, lamotrigine and olanzapine performed better than placebo, with lithium and lamotrigine having the strongest evidence. For depressive relapse prevention, valproate, lamotrigine and imipramine performed better than placebo, with evidence strongest for lamotrigine and weakest for imipramine. For manic relapses, lithium and olanzapine performed significantly better than placebo. The MTC found that the best treatment for bipolar I patients with mainly depressive symptoms was valproate, followed by lithium plus imipramine. For bipolar I patients with mainly manic symptoms, olanzapine was the best treatment. From the studies investigating psychosocial interventions, there were few data for each comparison and outcome. The evidence suggests that cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), in combination with usual treatment, is effective for the prevention of relapse. Group psychoeducation and possibly family therapy may also have roles as adjunctive therapy for preventing relapse. The results from the decision analytic model developed on the cost-effectiveness of long-term maintenance treatments of bipolar I patients suggest that the choice of treatment is dependent upon a number of factors: the previous episode history of a patient and the mortality benefit assumed for lithium strategies. The results from the base-case analysis for patients with a recent history of depression suggest that valproate, lithium and the combination of lithium and imipramine are potentially cost-effective depending upon the amount that a decision-maker is willing to pay for additional health gain. Using conventional amounts that the NHS is prepared to pay for health gain, then the lithium-based strategies appear to be potentially cost-effective for this group. For patients with a recent history of mania, the choice of pharmacological intervention appears to be between olanzapine and lithium monotherapy. Again using conventional threshold as a reference point, the results suggest that lithium is the most cost-effective therapy. Excluding the additional mortality benefit associated with lithium-based strategies resulted in all treatments for patients with a recent history of a depressive episode being dominated by valproate and, in the case of patients with a recent history of a manic episode, by olanzapine. CONCLUSIONS: Lithium, valproate, lamotrigine and olanzapine are effective as maintenance therapy for the prevention of relapse in bipolar disorder. Olanzapine and lithium are efficacious for the prevention of manic relapses and valproate, lamotrigine and imipramine for the prevention of depressive relapse. There is some evidence that CBT, group psychoeducation and family therapy might be beneficial as adjuncts to pharmacological maintenance treatments. Insufficient information is available regarding the relative tolerability of the treatments or their relative effects on suicide rate and mortality. For patients with a recent depressive episode, valproate, lithium monotherapy and the combination of lithium and imipramine are potentially cost-effective. For patients with a recent manic episode, olanzapine and lithium monotherapy are potentially cost-effective. The cost-effectiveness estimates in both groups of patients were shown to be sensitive to the assumption of a reduced suicidal risk associated with lithium-based strategies. Further research is needed into the adverse effects of all treatments and the differential effects of agents. Good-quality trials of valproate, of combination therapy, e.g. lithium plus a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant, of psychosocial interventions and of the disorder in children are also required.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Soares-Weiser K ; Bravo Vergel Y; Beynon S ; Dunn G ; Barbieri M ; Duffy S ; Geddes J ; Gilbody S ; Palmer S ; Woolacott N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3310/hta11390 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/economics/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/administration & dosage/economics/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage/economics/*therapeutic use\r\nBenzodiazepines\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/economics/prevention & control/psychology\r\nCarbamazepine\r\n*Cognitive Behavioral Therapy/economics\r\nCost-Benefit Analysis\r\nDatabases, Bibliographic\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLithium\r\nMale\r\nModels, Economic\r\nOlanzapine\r\n*Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nSecondary Prevention\r\nTriazines\r\nValproic Acid","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Soares-Weiser K, Bravo Vergel Y, Beynon S, Dunn G, Barbieri M, Duffy S, Geddes J, Gilbody S, Palmer S, and Woolacott N (2007) A systematic review and economic model of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions for preventing relapse in people with bipolar disorder..

It has been suggested that changes in production/release of adipokines - molecules secreted by adipose tissue presenting anti-inflammatory (adiponectin) and pro-inflammatory (leptin, resistin) properties - might be implicated. Adiponectin, resistin and leptin were assessed in 25 acutely depressed BD individuals (88% medication-free and 68% treatment-naive) at baseline and after 6 weeks of lithium therapy, and in 23 healthy controls matched by age. The 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was used to assess depression severity. Levels of adiponectin significantly decreased after lithium monotherapy, while the levels of resistin and leptin remained stable after the follow-up period. Adipokine levels during depressive episodes in BD did not differ compared to controls. Pretreatment levels of leptin were higher in remitters and changes in resistin levels were negatively correlated to improvement of depressive symptoms with lithium. Our findings shed light in this pathophysiological process, which might be associated with metabolic syndrome, inflammation and other medical comorbidities in BD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Soeiro-de-Souza MG ; Gold PW ; Brunoni AR ; de Sousa RT ; Zanetti MV ; Carvalho AF ; Gattaz WF ; Machado-Vieira R ; Teixeira AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neulet.2014.02.005 ","Keywords":"Adiponectin/*blood\r\nAdult\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBipolar Disorder/*blood\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLeptin/blood\r\nLithium/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nResistin/blood\r\nYoung Adult\r\nAdiponectin\r\nBipolar\r\nDepression\r\nDisorder\r\nLithium\r\nMetabolic\r\nTreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Soeiro-de-Souza MG, Gold PW, Brunoni AR, de Sousa RT, Zanetti MV, Carvalho AF, Gattaz WF, Machado-Vieira R, and Teixeira AL (2014) Lithium decreases plasma adiponectin levels in bipolar depression..

However, to our knowledge, no study has examined the effect of zinc monotherapy on mood. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of zinc monotherapy on depressive symptoms and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in overweight or obese subjects. METHODS: Fifty overweight or obese subjects were randomly assigned into two groups and received either 30 mg zinc or placebo daily for 12 weeks. At baseline and post-intervention, depression severity was assessed using Beck depression inventory II (BDI II), and serum BDNF and zinc levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and atomic absorption spectrophotometry, respectively. RESULTS: The trial was completed with 46 subjects. After a 12-week supplementation, serum zinc and BDNF levels increased significantly in the zinc-supplemented group compared with the placebo group. BDI scores declined in both the groups at the end of the study, but reduction in the zinc-supplemented group was significantly higher than the placebo group. More analysis revealed that following supplementation, BDI scores decreased in subgroup of subjects with depressive symptoms (BDI ≥ 10) (n = 30), but did not change in the subgroup of non-depressed subjects (BDI < 10) (n = 16). Moreover, a significant inverse correlation was observed between serum BDNF levels and depression severity in all participants. Interestingly, a significant positive correlation was found between serum BDNF and zinc levels at baseline. CONCLUSION: Zinc monotherapy improves mood in overweight or obese subjects most likely through increasing BDNF levels.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Solati Z ; Jazayeri S ; Tehrani-Doost M ; Mahmoodianfard S ; Gohari MR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1179/1476830513Y.0000000105 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*blood\r\nDepression/blood/*diet therapy/psychology\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nObesity/blood/psychology\r\nOverweight/blood/*psychology\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nZinc/administration & dosage/*blood/*pharmacology\r\nBrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)\r\nDepression\r\nObesity\r\nZinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Solati Z, Jazayeri S, Tehrani-Doost M, Mahmoodianfard S, and Gohari MR (2015) Zinc monotherapy increases serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and decreases depressive symptoms in overweight or obese subjects: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial..

Past research has been limited by a reliance on cross-sectional designs, which does not allow for identification of within-person changes due to lithium and has not examined communication between brain regions (ie, networks). In the present study, we prospectively investigated the lithium monotherapy associated effects in vivo on the brain connectome in medication-free BP patients. In particular, we examined the within-person impact of lithium treatment on connectome indices previously linked to mania and depression in bipolar disorder. METHODS: Thirty-nine medication-free subjects - 26 BP (13 (hypo)manic and 13 depressed) and 13 closely matched healthy controls (HC) - were included. fMRI data were obtained at 3 timepoints: baseline, after 2 weeks, and after 8 weeks (total of 117 scans: 78 BP and 39 HC scans). BP subjects were clinically treated with lithium for 8 weeks while HC were scanned at the same time points but not treated. Graph theory metrics and repeated measures GLM were used to analyze lithium treatment associated effects. RESULTS: Consistent with hypotheses, lithium treatment was associated with a normalizing effect on mania-related connectome indices. Furthermore, shifts in both mania- and depression-related connectome indices were proportional to symptom change. Finally, lithium treatment-associated impact on amygdala function differed depending on baseline mood. CONCLUSIONS: Present findings provide deeper insight into the therapeutic neural mechanisms associated with lithium treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Spielberg JM ; Matyi MA ; Karne H ; Anand A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/bdi.12718 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*Affective Symptoms/diagnosis/drug therapy/psychology\r\n*Amygdala/drug effects/physiopathology\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis/drug therapy/psychology\r\nConnectome/*methods\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use\r\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging/methods\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Nerve Net/drug effects/physiopathology\r\nbipolar\r\nbrain networks\r\ndepression\r\ngraph theory\r\nlithium\r\nmania","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Spielberg JM, Matyi MA, Karne H, and Anand A (2019) Lithium monotherapy associated longitudinal effects on resting state brain networks in clinical treatment of bipolar disorder..

METHOD: The algorithm for pharmacological treatment of the Dutch multidisciplinary guideline for depression is compared with four other algorithms. RESULTS: The Dutch algorithm consists of five subsequent steps. Treatment is started with one out of many optional ADs (step 1); in case of non-response after 4-10 weeks, best evidence is for switching to another AD (step 2); next step is augmentation with lithium as the best option (step 3); the next step is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) (step 4); and finally electroconvulsive therapy (step 5). There are major differences with other algorithms regarding timing of augmentation step, best agents for augmentation and role of MAOI. CONCLUSION: Algorithms for AD treatment vary according to national and local preferences. Although the evidence for most of the treatment strategies is rather meagre, an AD algorithm appears to be an useful instrument in clinical practice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Spijker J ; Nolen WA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0447.2009.01492.x ","Keywords":"Algorithms\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Resistance/*drug effects\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nMEDLINE\r\nMeta-Analysis as Topic\r\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/therapeutic use\r\nNetherlands\r\nPractice Guidelines as Topic\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Spijker J, and Nolen WA (2010) An algorithm for the pharmacological treatment of depression..

The efficacy of lithium in the treatment of acute manic episodes has been recognised for several decades, primarily using concentrations in the range of 0.8 to 2 mmol/L. The number of patients responding increases as the serum lithium concentration increases, although individual patients may respond at lower concentrations (<0.8 mmol/L). Lithium doses and serum concentrations similar to those used to treat acute mania have been studied in bipolar depression, with no evaluation of a relationship between concentration and clinical response. Several prospective controlled trials have evaluated this relationship in the prophylactic treatment of bipolar disorder. Maintaining higher serum lithium concentrations (0.8 to 1 mmol/L) improves the likelihood of good effect in prophylactic treatment, although individual patients may do well on lower concentrations. Despite the paucity of evidence to specifically support the efficacy of lithium at lower serum lithium concentrations in the elderly, lower target ranges (0.5 to 0.8 mmol/L) are commonly recommended due to an increased sensitivity to adverse effects, particularly neurotoxicity. The serum lithium concentrations recommended in adults have been applied to children; however, this has not been studied. Overall, the evidence suggests a relationship between serum lithium concentration and therapeutic effect, although the exact nature of this relationship is not clear. For example, it is not known why some people respond to lower concentrations and others do not. There are many factors that influence studies trying to elucidate this relationship. Many of these factors are related to the interpretation of the serum lithium concentration. In summary, patients have an increased chance of responding to lithium if 12-hour serum lithium concentrations at steady state are above 0.8 mmol/L. Many patients will respond to lower concentrations (0.4 to 0.7 mmol/L), but we are unable to identify these patients a priori. The relationship between serum lithium concentrations and adverse effects is also very important in determining appropriate target lithium concentrations. The current best advice is to individualise the target serum lithium concentrations based on efficacy and tolerability and to optimise the interpretation of these concentrations by ensuring within-patient consistency with respect to dosage schedule, lithium preparation and the timing of blood sampling.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sproule B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2165/00003088-200241090-00002 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAged\r\nBipolar Disorder/blood/*drug therapy\r\nChild\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\n*Lithium/blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPatient Compliance\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sproule B (2002) Lithium in bipolar disorder: can drug concentrations predict therapeutic effect?.

Among mood stabilizers, lithium is the mainstay for the treatment of BD, with approximately one-third of patients showing remission from episode recurrence. While there is evidence suggesting genetic load for lithium response in BD, its molecular underpinnings are still not completely understood. To identify genes potentially involved in (or correlated with) lithium response, we carried out a genome-wide expression analysis on lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 10 BD patients responders (R) and 10 non-responders (NR) to lithium. We compared expression levels of the two groups and tested whether in vitro lithium treatment had different effects in LCLs of R compared to NR. At basal, 2060 genes were differentially expressed between R and NR while no genes were differentially regulated by lithium in the two groups. After pathway analysis based on the 2060 genes, 9 genes were selected for validation with qRT-PCR. Eight genes were validated in the same sample of LCLs while only insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was significantly over-expressed in R compared to NR in the same sample as well as in an independent sample comprised of 6 R and 6 NR (sample 1, fold change=1.94; p=0.005; sample 2, fold change=2.21; p=0.005). IGF-1 was also significantly over-expressed in R but not in NR when compared to a sample of non-psychiatric controls. Our findings suggest that IGF-1 may be involved in lithium response, supporting further investigation on its potential as a biomarker.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Squassina A ; Costa M ; Congiu D ; Manchia M ; Angius A ; Deiana V ; Ardau R ; Chillotti C ; Severino G ; Calza S ; Del Zompo M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.phrs.2013.04.004 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/*genetics\r\nCell Line\r\nFemale\r\nGene Expression Profiling\r\nGenome-Wide Association Study\r\nHumans\r\nInsulin-Like Growth Factor I/*genetics\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use\r\nLymphocytes/cytology\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis\r\nUp-Regulation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Squassina A, Costa M, Congiu D, Manchia M, Angius A, Deiana V, Ardau R, Chillotti C, Severino G, Calza S, and Del Zompo M (2013) Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) expression is up-regulated in lymphoblastoid cell lines of lithium responsive bipolar disorder patients..

In contrast, augmentation of antidepressant drugs with pindolol has been shown to improve responsiveness to antidepressants in short (s)-allele carriers. Lithium augmentation is a well-established strategy for overcoming treatment resistance. In this study, the 5-HTTLPR allele variant's effect on lithium augmentation was analyzed in antidepressant-nonresponsive patients. METHODS: We measured remission rates during lithium augmentation in 50 depressed patients genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR. All patients took part in phase II of the German Algorithm Project, a prospective study for the evaluation of a standardized stepwise drug treatment regimen. For statistical analysis, the Cox regression model including several clinical factors besides the 5-HTTLPR was used. RESULTS: Only the genotype of the 5-HTTLPR (P<0.006) showed a signficant influence on remission. Patients homozygous for the s-allele had a more favorable response compared with those heterozygous (hazard ratio=6.9; P=0.005) or homozygous for the l allele (hazard ratio=4.5; P=0.003). CONCLUSION: The findings support a differential effect of the 5-HTTLPR gene on primary treatment with antidepressants and treatment augmentation. Similar to the observations with pindolol, s/s-allele patients showed a higher benefit from lithium augmentation than did patients carrying other 5-HTTLPR genotypes. Thus, the s/s genotype might predict an individual's risk of antidepressant nonresponsiveness and sensitivity to augmentative drugs such as lithium.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Stamm TJ ; Adli M ; Kirchheiner J ; Smolka MN ; Kaiser R ; Tremblay PB ; Bauer M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/YPG.0b013e3282f08a19 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAlleles\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nChromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics\r\nDepressive Disorder/complications/drug therapy/*genetics\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nGenotype\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Minisatellite Repeats\r\nProportional Hazards Models\r\nProspective Studies\r\nPsychotic Disorders/complications\r\nSerotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Stamm TJ, Adli M, Kirchheiner J, Smolka MN, Kaiser R, Tremblay PB, and Bauer M (2008) Serotonin transporter gene and response to lithium augmentation in depression..

There was no significant difference between placebo and 250 mg lithium for weeks 0-3 of the trial. However, there was a significantly greater improvement on the MADRS for weeks 3-6 for those subjects on 750 mg lithium than for those on 250 mg lithium. In addition, using a 50% fall in the HRSD as a criterion of drug responsiveness, 22% responded to placebo, 18% to 250 mg lithium, and 44% to 750 mg lithium. Thus, lithium in normal, but not in low, dose has a significant antidepressant effect in TCA-resistant depression. Further controlled studies using lithium in normal dose in trials which have a greater duration of placebo exposure are required to confirm the lithium augmentation effect.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Stein G ; Bernadt M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1192/bjp.162.5.634 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\n*Drug Resistance\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPlacebo Effect","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Stein G, and Bernadt M (1993) Lithium augmentation therapy in tricyclic-resistant depression.

Discouragement is common, so knowledge of likelihood of eventual remission as well as which treatments might ultimately be effective would help patient and clinician alike. METHOD: Thirty-one patients with major depression were recruited, 28 beginning study treatment. All had remained significantly depressed following adequate (4 weeks taking ≥ PDR maximum dose) trials on ≥ two antidepressants having different presumed mechanisms. Patients were begun on tranylcypromine to 60 mg/d, were then treated with up to 120 mg/d and then had dextroamphetamine added. Following two week wash-out, patients were then treated with nortriptyline+lithium, and then phenelzine was added. Each successive phase was entered only if remission had not been achieved, and phases could be skipped. RESULTS: Eighteen of the 28 patients (65%) remitted in one of the five phases of the study, plus 5 additional patients with open post-study treatment (total remitting, 82%). By study phase, Eight of 27 (30%) patients remitted with initial dosing of tranylcypromine up to 60 mg/d, 6/18 (33%) remitted with above PDR dosing of tranylcypromine up to 120 mg/d, and 1/6 (17%) to adding dextroamphetamine. With nortriptyline, 1/10 (10%) remitted with nortriptyline+lithium, and 1/5 (20%) when phenelzine was added. Eighteen of the 28 patients (64%), or 78% of those who remitted, maintained their good benefit for at least six months. DISCUSSION: The majority of depressed patients refractory to two or more adequately utilized differently acting antidepressant medications can still remit and about half may maintain remission for extended periods. \"Refractory depression\" appears to be a relative description for many unresponsive depressed patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Stewart JW ; Deliyannides DA ; McGrath PJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2014.05.047 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nCentral Nervous System Stimulants/administration & dosage\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*drug therapy\r\nDextroamphetamine/administration & dosage\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/administration & dosage\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNortriptyline/administration & dosage\r\nPhenelzine/administration & dosage\r\nTranylcypromine/administration & dosage\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nDextroamphetamine\r\nLithium\r\nNortriptyline\r\nPhenelzine\r\nRefractory depression\r\nTranylcypromine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Stewart JW, Deliyannides DA, and McGrath PJ (2014) How treatable is refractory depression?.

Although treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a key contributor to that burden, there is little understanding of the best treatment approaches for it and specifically the effectiveness of available augmentation approaches.AimsWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to search and quantify the evidence of psychological and pharmacological augmentation interventions for TRD. METHOD: Participants with TRD (defined as insufficient response to at least two antidepressants) were randomised to at least one augmentation treatment in the trial. Pre-post analysis assessed treatment effectiveness, providing an effect size (ES) independent of comparator interventions. RESULTS: Of 28 trials, 3 investigated psychological treatments and 25 examined pharmacological interventions. Pre-post analyses demonstrated N-methyl-d-aspartate-targeting drugs to have the highest ES (ES = 1.48, 95% CI 1.25-1.71). Other than aripiprazole (four studies, ES = 1.33, 95% CI 1.23-1.44) and lithium (three studies, ES = 1.00, 95% CI 0.81-1.20), treatments were each investigated in less than three studies. Overall, pharmacological (ES = 1.19, 95% CI 1.80-1.30) and psychological (ES = 1.43, 95% CI 0.50-2.36) therapies yielded higher ESs than pill placebo (ES = 0.78, 95% CI 0.66-0.91) and psychological control (ES = 0.94, 95% CI 0.36-1.52). CONCLUSIONS: Despite being used widely in clinical practice, the evidence for augmentation treatments in TRD is sparse. Although pre-post meta-analyses are limited by the absence of direct comparison, this work finds promising evidence across treatment modalities.Declaration of interestIn the past 3 years, A.H.Y. received honoraria for speaking from AstraZeneca, Lundbeck, Eli Lilly and Sunovion; honoraria for consulting from Allergan, Livanova and Lundbeck, Sunovion and Janssen; and research grant support from Janssen.

Advantages of 'sub-therapeutic' doses are increasingly being reported, which is apposite given enduring concerns around adverse effects of 'therapeutic' doses. We aimed to synthesise all available evidence from interventional studies investigating low-dose lithium (LDL) across neuropsychiatric outcomes. METHODS: Electronic databases were systematically searched to include studies where a group of adult humans were treated with LDL (∼serum level ≤0.6 mmol/L), where data describing a neuropsychiatric outcome were reported either before and after treatment, and/or between lithium and a comparator. RESULTS: 18 articles were examined and grouped according to outcome domain (cognition, depression, mania, and related constructs e.g., suicidality). Significant benefits (versus placebo) were identified for attenuating cognitive decline, and potentially as an adjunctive therapy for people with depression/mania. Across studies, LDL was reported to be safe. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the paucity and heterogeneity of studies, LDL's apparent pro-cognitive effects and positive safety profile open promising avenues in the fields of neurodegeneration, and augmentation in affective disorders. We urge future examinations of LDL's potential to prevent cognitive/affective syndromes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Strawbridge R ; Kerr-Gaffney J ; Bessa G ; Loschi G ; Freitas HLO ; Pires H ; Cousins DA ; Juruena MF ; Young AH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neubiorev.2022.104975 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nHumans\r\n*Lithium/therapeutic use\r\n*Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nMania/chemically induced/drug therapy\r\nMood Disorders/drug therapy\r\nAffect\r\nCognition\r\nDepression\r\nLithium\r\nLow-dose\r\nMania\r\nMicrodose\r\nSystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Strawbridge R, Kerr-Gaffney J, Bessa G, Loschi G, Freitas HLO, Pires H, Cousins DA, Juruena MF, and Young AH (2023) Identifying the neuropsychiatric health effects of low-dose lithium interventions: A systematic review..

METHODS: We retrospectively examined the predictive value of clinical variables in 79 depressed patients who underwent lithium augmentation after failure to respond to antidepressant monotherapy. Lithium augmentation efficacy was evaluated by Clinical Global Impression Improvement assessment 4 to 8 weeks after initiating lithium administration; subjects with scores of 1 and 2 were defined as responders, and those with scores of 3 to 7 as non-responders. Clinical variables, including demographic and diagnostic variables, psychiatric medication, and clinical variables, were compared between groups. The bipolarity of patients with major depressive disorder as a final diagnosis was evaluated in association with the lithium augmentation efficacy. Data were analyzed using a chi-square test or Fisher's test. RESULTS: The lithium augmentation efficacy rate was 41% among 79 enrolled patients (14 dropped out, 32 responders, and 33 non-responders). Lithium augmentation was significantly more effective for patients with a final diagnosis of bipolar disorder than with major depressive disorder (p=0.03). Subjects with more than three major depressive episodes showed a significant response to lithium augmentation (p=0.004). The rate of a family history of major depressive disorder/bipolar disorder in a first-degree relative was significantly higher in responders (34%) than in non-responders (7%, p=0.01), consistent with the association between the efficacy of lithium augmentation and bipolarity in major depressive disorder (responders=27% vs. non-responders=3%, p=0.03). LIMITATION: The study was retrospective and severity was not analyzed. CONCLUSION: Bipolar disorder, frequency of major depressive episodes, and family history of major depressive disorder/bipolar disorder in a first-degree relative were detected as predictors of lithium augmentation efficacy. Among them, family history of major depressive disorder/bipolar disorder in a first-degree relative was the most reliable predictor of lithium augmentation efficacy for bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sugawara H ; Sakamoto K ; Harada T ; Ishigooka J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2009.12.025 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nComorbidity\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nRecurrence\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sugawara H, Sakamoto K, Harada T, and Ishigooka J (2010) Predictors of efficacy in lithium augmentation for treatment-resistant depression..

The subjects of the current study were 138 chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLT) patients with hypothyroidism admitted to our hospital from May 2016 to September 2019 and were randomly divided into a control group taking levothyroxine sodium (LT4) treatment and a combined group of LT4 combined with selenium treatment, with 69 cases each. Patients in both groups were evaluated for efficacy after 3 months of treatment, and their thyroid function was observed by total triiodothyronine (TT3), total thyroxine (TT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), and thyroid globulin antibody (TGAb), and their mood changes were observed by Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores. The levels of inflammatory factors such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured, and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions during the treatment period was observed and recorded in all patients. The results showed that the total effective rate of the combined group was significantly higher than that of the control group. The levels of TT3, TT4, TSH, TgAb, and TPOAb, SAS and SDS scores, and levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-2, IL-10, and TNF-α were significantly improved in both groups after treatment. Compared with the control group, TGAb, TPOAb, IL-2, TNF-α levels, and SAS and SDS scores decreased more and IL-10 levels increased more in the combined group, while the differences of other indexes were not statistically significant. This suggests that LT4 has certain efficacy in treating CLT with hypothyroidism, and the combined selenium treatment can improve the therapeutic effect of LT4 and can play a greater role in improving patients' mood and immune and inflammatory responses.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sun C ; Zhu M ; Li L ; Fan H ; Lv F ; Zhu D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1155/2021/5471281 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sun C, Zhu M, Li L, Fan H, Lv F, and Zhu D (2021) Clinical Observation of Levothyroxine Sodium Combined with Selenium in the Treatment of Patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Thyroiditis and Hypothyroidism and the Effects on Thyroid Function, Mood, and Inflammatory Factors..

The development of typical antipsychotic drugs opened an avenue of investigation through the dopamine D2 receptor in schizophrenia. With the reintroduction of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine came the development of a new generation of atypical agents and hypotheses challenging the centrality of this receptor in explaining antipsychotic effects. Evaluation of these competing theories does not provide sufficient evidence to displace the importance of the dopamine D2 receptor in antipsychotic efficacy, but does raise limitations of it as an explanatory hypothesis. Further, the treatment of other symptom domains in schizophrenia remains relatively neglected and open for the development of novel therapies. Similar to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder presents a diversity of clinical states but unlike schizophrenia, its mainstay of treatment, lithium, has not had a clear receptor target impeding understanding of the disorder's pathology and treatment. This has pushed investigation into other domains emphasising a number of intracellular signalling pathways and glial-neuronal interactions. The heavy genetic loading of bipolar disorder has allowed linkage analyses to identify a number of putative regions, however, the diversity of phenotypes complicates such studies. Polymorphisms of candidate genes have yielded potential leads such as dopamine beta hydroxylase in mood disorder and the serotonin transporter for treatment response. It is anticipated that combiningthe above approaches may hold promise for the development of more effective treatments.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sundram S ; Joyce PR ; Kennedy MA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1566524033479708 ","Keywords":"Antipsychotic Agents/pharmacology\r\nBipolar Disorder/genetics/metabolism/*therapy\r\nHumans\r\nSchizophrenia/etiology/metabolism/*therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sundram S, Joyce PR, and Kennedy MA (2003) Schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder: perspectives for the development of therapeutics..

The diagnosis and management of bipolar depression are challenging, and many patients are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to symptom similarities with unipolar depression or other illnesses and/or comorbidities. Untreated or inappropriately treated bipolar depression adds to the burden of illness and is associated with a greater risk of suicide. Treatment options include lithium, lamotrigine, atypical antipsychotics, and traditional antidepressants, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However, traditional antidepressants are recommended with caution due to their potential risk of switching patients into mania. Some atypical antipsychotics have shown efficacy in bipolar depression, although longer-term studies are warranted. The choice of treatment for different subgroups of patients with bipolar depression, including those with comorbid anxiety, may vary and also needs further study. Other important issues that require further investigation include the recognition of the core features of bipolar depression and the threshold symptoms for treatment, as well as the optimal treatment choices for monotherapy or combination therapy, and acute versus long-term management of bipolar depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Suppes T ; Kelly DI ; Perla JM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnticonvulsants/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nComorbidity\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLife Change Events\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nPatient Education as Topic/methods\r\nPsychotherapy/methods\r\nSex Factors\r\nTriazines/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Suppes T, Kelly DI, and Perla JM (2005) Challenges in the management of bipolar depression..

The objective of this study was to compare lamotrigine (LTG) and lithium (Li) monotherapy for the treatment of BDII depression. METHODS: Patients with BDII acute depression were randomized to open-label monotherapy with LTG or Li, and evaluated by trained raters blinded to treatment. Patients were titrated to 200 mg/day of LTG over 8 weeks or at least 900 mg/day of Li over 2 weeks (serum level 0.6-1.2 mEq/L), and seen biweekly for 16 weeks. The primary outcome variable was change in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item (Ham-D(17)), evaluated using mixed effects random regression. RESULTS: Both groups showed significant improvement from baseline to endpoint on the Ham-D(17) (p<0.0001), with no between group differences (p=0.95). Seventy-two percent of the population was rapid cycling by DSM-IV criteria. No differences in response were noted between rapid cyclers and non-rapid cyclers. Early termination for any cause was 42%. The Li group reported significantly more side effects, although drop-out due to side effects did not differ between groups. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by an open treatment design, a lack of placebo arm, and uneven treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Lamotrigine and lithium were effective monotherapy for BDII depression, with comparable response and remission rates. Naturalistic design and lack of placebo limit conclusions, though patient history indicated long standing depression unlikely to be alleviated by time. Patients who received Li reported more side effects, but this did not appear to impact drop-out rates.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Suppes T ; Marangell LB ; Bernstein IH ; Kelly DI ; Fischer EG ; Zboyan HA ; Snow DE ; Martinez M ; Al Jurdi R ; Shivakumar G ; Sureddi S ; Gonzalez R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2008.02.004 ","Keywords":"Acute Disease\r\nAdolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAmbulatory Care\r\nAnticonvulsants/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLithium Compounds/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPatient Dropouts\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSingle-Blind Method\r\nSurvival Analysis\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nTriazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Suppes T, Marangell LB, Bernstein IH, Kelly DI, Fischer EG, Zboyan HA, Snow DE, Martinez M, Al Jurdi R, Shivakumar G, Sureddi S, and Gonzalez R (2008) A single blind comparison of lithium and lamotrigine for the treatment of bipolar II depression..

Improvement in the placebo-subtracted MADRS total score was notably larger at week 6 for the non-run-in cohort compared to the run-in cohort (LS mean difference in endpoint change scores, -4.6; P = 0.009). Adverse events most frequently reported for lurasidone were akathisia, somnolence, and extrapyramidal side effects. In conclusion, lurasidone adjunctive with lithium or valproate demonstrated significant improvement in depressive symptoms based on the MADRS from weeks 2-5 but not at the primary week 6 endpoint.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Suppes T ; Kroger H ; Pikalov A ; Loebel A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2016.03.012 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nAntimanic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLeast-Squares Analysis\r\nLithium Compounds/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood\r\nLurasidone Hydrochloride/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nValproic Acid/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood\r\nYoung Adult\r\nBipolar depression\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nLithium\r\nLurasidone\r\nMajor depressive episode\r\nValproate","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Suppes T, Kroger H, Pikalov A, and Loebel A (2016) Lurasidone adjunctive with lithium or valproate for bipolar depression: A placebo-controlled trial utilizing prospective and retrospective enrolment cohorts..

METHODS: A pooled analysis of two (one 3-week and one 6-week) double-blind studies of a total of 370 patients hospitalized with bipolar I mania who received quetiapine (up to 800 mg/day) in combination with Li (mean serum concentration 0.76 mEq/L) or DVP (mean serum concentration 69.5 microg/mL) was performed. For both studies, data were analyzed at Day 21. In addition, for the 6-week study, data were analyzed at Day 42. Five different criteria for remission/euthymia were used: (i) Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score < or = 12; (ii) YMRS score < or = 12 plus a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score < or = 10; (iii) YMRS score < or = 12+MADRS score < or = 8; (iv) YMRS score < or = 8; and (v) YMRS score < or = 8 plus a score < or = 2 for the YMRS core items of Irritability, Speech, Content, and Disruptive/Aggressive Behavior. RESULTS: In the pooled analysis, Day 21 remission rates (YMRS < or = 12) were significantly higher in patients treated with QTP+Li/DVP compared with those who received PBO+Li/DVP (48.7% versus 33.0%, p=0.003). Rates of remission/euthymia (YMRS < or = 12+MADRS < or = 10) were similarly improved with QTP+Li/DVP compared with Li/DVP alone (43.2% versus 26.5%, p=0.001). Using the most stringent criteria (YMRS < or = 12+MADRS < or = 8), rates of remission/euthymia were again significantly higher with QTP+Li/DVP than with Li/DVP alone (38.4% versus 25.9%, p=0.014). More patients treated with quetiapine met the stringent criterion of YMRS < or = 8 (31.9% versus 24.3%; p=NS). A trend in favor of quetiapine was also observed for the more stringent criterion of YMRS < or = 8 plus core items < or = 2 (28.1% versus 23.2%; p=NS). For the 6-week study, at Day 42, YMRS was < or = 12 in 68.3% of patients treated with QTP+Li/DVP compared with 57.3% of those who received PBO+Li/DVP (p=NS). Respective rates based on the remission criterion of YMRS < or = 8 were 36.5% and 32.3% (p=NS), and with YMRS < or = 8 and core items < or = 2 were 53.8% and 45.8% (p=NS). However, a significant difference was observed between patients treated with QTP+Li/DVP versus those treated with PBO+Li/DVP using criteria of YMRS < or = 12+MADRS < or = 10 (63.5% versus 49.0%, p<0.05) or YMRS < or = 12+MADRS < or = 8 (61.5% versus 46.9%, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: At Days 21 and 42, quetiapine combined with Li/DVP compared to Li/DVP monotherapy yielded significant, sustained improvements in the rate of clinical remission/euthymia in patients with bipolar mania. Longer-term studies are warranted to assess whether quetiapine combined with other mood stabilizing medications can yield even longer-term resolution of symptoms of acute mania while concurrently preventing emergence of depressive symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sussman N ; Mullen J ; Paulsson B ; Vågerö M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2007.02.008 ","Keywords":"Acute Disease\r\nAffect/*drug effects\r\nAntimanic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDibenzothiazepines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMulticenter Studies as Topic\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nQuetiapine Fumarate\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nValproic Acid/adverse effects/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sussman N, Mullen J, Paulsson B, and Vågerö M (2007) Rates of remission/euthymia with quetiapine in combination with lithium/divalproex for the treatment of acute mania..

However, it is unclear whether early improvement predicts final response/remission in bipolar depression treated with this regimen. METHOD: We studied 220 consecutively admitted inpatients with a major depressive episode in the course of bipolar disorder. The relation between response to first SD and response/remission at the end of the treatment (day 6) was analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Severity of depression was rated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Clinical response was defined as a ≥50% reduction in HDRS scores, and remission was defined as an HDRS score of ≤7. RESULTS: Among the 217 completers, 67.7% showed response and 54.4% reached remission at the end of the treatment. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that response after first recovery sleep (day 2) predicted final response and remission at the end of the treatment with high odds ratios (10.9 for response and 8.2 for remission); however, response immediately after the first SD (day 1) did not predict final response or remission. LIMITATIONS: Whether our results can be generalized to unipolar depression remains uncertain. CONCLUSION: Clinical status after first recovery sleep is a strong predictor of successful final outcome in patients with bipolar depression treated with the combination of repeated SD, LT, and lithium. Recovery sleep may play a role in inducing the antidepressant effect associated with the success of treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Suzuki M ; Dallaspezia S ; Locatelli C ; Uchiyama M ; Colombo C ; Benedetti F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2017.12.066 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPhototherapy/*methods\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nRemission Induction/methods\r\n*Sleep Deprivation\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nChronotherapeutics\r\nDepression\r\nEarly response\r\nPrediction of outcome\r\nSleep deprivation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Suzuki M, Dallaspezia S, Locatelli C, Uchiyama M, Colombo C, and Benedetti F (2018) Does early response predict subsequent remission in bipolar depression treated with repeated sleep deprivation combined with light therapy and lithium?.

The presence of depressive symptoms during manic episodes may be associated with poor response to psychopharmacological treatments. This is an investigation of the relation between depressive symptoms and treatment response in acute manic episodes. METHODS AND DESIGN: In a parallel-group, double-blind study, 179 patients hospitalized for acute manic episodes were randomized to receive divalproex sodium, lithium carbonate, or placebo (ratio, 2:1:2). The study was carried out at 9 academic medical centers. Patients had comprehensive evaluations of behavior and symptoms before and during 3 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome measure, change in mania factor scores derived from the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia: Change Version, was compared in patients with and without depressive symptoms at baseline according to nurse- or physician-rated scales. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms were associated with poor antimanic response to lithium and with better response to divalproex. This was not due to differences in overall severity of illness, substance abuse, gender, age, or history. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that even a modest level of pretreatment depression-related symptoms is a robust predictor of lithium nonresponse, and is associated with better response to divalproex. Although their overall efficacy in acute mania is similar, lithium and divalproex may be most effective in clinically and biologically distinct groups of patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Swann AC ; Bowden CL ; Morris D ; Calabrese JR ; Petty F ; Small J ; Dilsaver SC ; Davis JM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1001/archpsyc.1997.01830130041008 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nPatient Dropouts\r\nPlacebos\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nValproic Acid/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Swann AC, Bowden CL, Morris D, Calabrese JR, Petty F, Small J, Dilsaver SC, and Davis JM (1997) Depression during mania.

Neuronal zinc is concentrated exclusively within glutamatergic neurons, acting as an allosteric modulator of the N-methyl D-aspartate and other receptors that regulate excitatory neurotransmission and neuroplasticity. Zinc-containing neurons form extensive associational circuitry throughout the cortex, amygdala and hippocampus, which subserve mood regulation and cognitive functions. In animal models of depression, zinc is reduced in these circuits, zinc treatment has antidepressant-like effects and dietary zinc insufficiency induces depressive behaviors. Clinically, serum zinc is lower in MDD, which may constitute a state-marker of illness and a risk factor for treatment-resistance. Marginal zinc deficiency in MDD may relate to multiple putative mechanisms underlying core symptomatology and neuroprogression (e.g. immune dysfunction, monoamine metabolism, stress response dysregulation, oxidative/nitrosative stress, neurotrophic deficits, transcriptional/epigenetic regulation of neural networks). Initial randomized trials suggest a benefit of zinc supplementation. In summary, molecular and animal behavioral data support the clinical significance of zinc in the setting of MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Swardfager W ; Herrmann N ; McIntyre RS ; Mazereeuw G ; Goldberger K ; Cha DS ; Schwartz Y ; Lanctôt KL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.03.018 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/metabolism/pathology/*physiopathology/*therapy\r\nHumans\r\nNeurons/metabolism\r\nReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/metabolism\r\nSynaptic Transmission\r\nZinc/*metabolism/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Swardfager W, Herrmann N, McIntyre RS, Mazereeuw G, Goldberger K, Cha DS, Schwartz Y, and Lanctôt KL (2013) Potential roles of zinc in the pathophysiology and treatment of major depressive disorder..

This study sought to quantitatively summarize the clinical data comparing peripheral blood zinc concentrations between depressed and nondepressed subjects. METHODS: PubMed, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and PsycINFO were searched for original peer-reviewed studies (to June 2012) measuring zinc concentrations in serum or plasma from depressed subjects (identified by either screening or clinical criteria) and nondepressed control subjects. Mean (±SD) zinc concentrations were extracted, combined quantitatively in random-effects meta-analysis, and summarized as a weighted mean difference (WMD). RESULTS: Seventeen studies, measuring peripheral blood zinc concentrations in 1643 depressed and 804 control subjects, were included. Zinc concentrations were approximately -1.85 µmol/L lower in depressed subjects than control subjects (95% confidence interval: [CI]: -2.51 to -1.19 µmol/L, Z17 = 5.45, p < .00001). Heterogeneity was detected (χ(2)17 = 142.81, p < .00001, I(2) = 88%) and explored; in studies that quantified depressive symptoms, greater depression severity was associated with greater relative zinc deficiency (B = -1.503, t9 = -2.82, p = .026). Effect sizes were numerically larger in studies of inpatients (WMD -2.543, 95% CI: -3.522 to -1.564, Z9 = 5.09, p < .0001) versus community samples (WMD -.943, 95% CI: -1.563 to -.323, Z7 = 2.98, p = .003) and in studies of higher methodological quality (WMD -2.354, 95% CI: -2.901 to -1.807, Z7 = 8.43, p < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Depression is associated with a lower concentration of zinc in peripheral blood. The pathophysiological relationships between zinc status and depression, and the potential benefits of zinc supplementation in depressed patients, warrant further investigation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Swardfager W ; Herrmann N ; Mazereeuw G ; Goldberger K ; Harimoto T ; Lanctôt KL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.05.008 ","Keywords":"Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data\r\nDepression/*blood\r\nHumans\r\nZinc/*blood\r\nDepression\r\ndepressive symptoms\r\nmajor depressive disorder\r\nmicronutrient\r\ntrace metal\r\nzinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Swardfager W, Herrmann N, Mazereeuw G, Goldberger K, Harimoto T, and Lanctôt KL (2013) Zinc in depression: a meta-analysis..

The pressing clinical need for evidence-based approaches to the treatment of bipolar II disorder, coupled with recent publication of pertinent studies, calls for an updated review of this literature. This review focuses on a critical examination of the evidence supporting the efficacy of treatments for acute depressive episodes in bipolar II disorder. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE (via Ovid) search of journals, covering the period from January 1950 to January 2009, was performed to identify relevant studies. Keywords used were bipolar II disorder, bipolar disorder, bipolar depression, and pharmacotherapy. Studies were further limited to those that were in adult samples, published in peer-reviewed journals, and written in English. STUDY SELECTION: We examined all randomized trials evaluating the use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of acute bipolar II depression. Studies with mixed samples of bipolar I and II or bipolar II and unipolar depression were examined as well. Twenty-one randomized trials were identified and reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: Therapeutic agents were rated according to the quality of evidence supporting their efficacy as treatments for bipolar II depression. DATA SYNTHESIS: Ninety percent of relevant trials were published after 2005. Quetiapine was judged as having compelling evidence supporting its efficacy. Lithium, antidepressants, and pramipexole were judged as having preliminary support for efficacy. Lamotrigine was considered to have mixed support. CONCLUSIONS: Although progress has been made, further research on bipolar II depression is warranted.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Swartz HA ; Thase ME ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.09r05192gre ","Keywords":"Acute Disease\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBenzhydryl Compounds/therapeutic use\r\nBenzothiazoles/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDibenzothiazepines/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use\r\nModafinil\r\nPramipexole\r\nQuetiapine Fumarate\r\nTriazines/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Swartz HA, and Thase ME (2011) Pharmacotherapy for the treatment of acute bipolar II depression: current evidence..

Despite long use in clinical practice, the exact molecular mechanisms of lithium are still not well identified. Previous experimental studies produced inconsistent results due to different duration of lithium treatment and using animals without manic-like or depressive-like symptoms. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the gene expression profile in three brain regions (amygdala, frontal cortex and hippocampus) in the rat model of mania and depression during chronic lithium administration (2 and 4 weeks). Behavioral changes were verified by the forced swim test, open field test and elevated maze test. After the experiment, nucleic acid was extracted from the frontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. Gene expression profile was done using SurePrint G3 Rat Gene Expression whole transcriptome microarrays. Data were analyzed using Gene Spring 14.9 software. We found that chronic lithium treatment significantly influenced gene expression profile in both mania and depression models. In manic rats, chronic lithium treatment significantly influenced the expression of the genes enriched in olfactory and taste transduction pathway and long non-coding RNAs in all three brain regions. We report here for the first time that genes regulating olfactory and taste receptor pathways and long non-coding RNAs may be targeted by chronic lithium treatment in the animal model of mania.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Szczepankiewicz D ; Celichowski P ; Kołodziejski PA ; Pruszyńska-Oszmałek E ; Sassek M ; Zakowicz P ; Banach E ; Langwiński W ; Sakrajda K ; Nowakowska J ; Socha M ; Bukowska-Olech E ; Pawlak J ; Twarowska-Hauser J ; Nogowski L ; Rybakowski JK ; Szczepankiewicz A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ijms22031148 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBrain/*metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/genetics\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nLithium/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMania/*drug therapy/genetics\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\n*Transcriptome\r\nanimal model\r\nbrain\r\ndepressive-like behavior\r\nlithium\r\nmanic-like behavior\r\ntranscriptome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Szczepankiewicz D, Celichowski P, Kołodziejski PA, Pruszyńska-Oszmałek E, Sassek M, Zakowicz P, Banach E, Langwiński W, Sakrajda K, Nowakowska J, Socha M, Bukowska-Olech E, Pawlak J, Twarowska-Hauser J, Nogowski L, Rybakowski JK, and Szczepankiewicz A (2021) Transcriptome Changes in Three Brain Regions during Chronic Lithium Administration in the Rat Models of Mania and Depression..

Zinc and magnesium exhibit antidepressant-like activity in a variety of tests and models in laboratory animals. They are active in forced swim and tail suspension tests in mice and rats, and, furthermore, they enhance the activity of conventional antidepressants (e.g., imipramine and citalopram). Zinc demonstrates activity in the olfactory bulbectomy, chronic mild and chronic unpredictable stress models in rats, while magnesium is active in stress-induced depression-like behavior in mice. Clinical studies demonstrate that the efficacy of pharmacotherapy is enhanced by supplementation with zinc and magnesium. The antidepressant mechanisms of zinc and magnesium are discussed in the context of glutamate, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) hypotheses. All the available data indicate the importance of zinc and magnesium homeostasis in the psychopathology and therapy of affective disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Szewczyk B ; Poleszak E ; Sowa-Kućma M ; Siwek M ; Dudek D ; Ryszewska-Pokraśniewicz B ; Radziwoń-Zaleska M ; Opoka W ; Czekaj J ; Pilc A ; Nowak G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors\r\nHumans\r\nMagnesium Compounds/metabolism/*pharmacology\r\nReceptors, Glutamate/drug effects\r\nSerotonin/physiology\r\nZinc Compounds/metabolism/*pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Szewczyk B, Poleszak E, Sowa-Kućma M, Siwek M, Dudek D, Ryszewska-Pokraśniewicz B, Radziwoń-Zaleska M, Opoka W, Czekaj J, Pilc A, and Nowak G (2008) Antidepressant activity of zinc and magnesium in view of the current hypotheses of antidepressant action..

The present study investigates the involvement of the serotonergic system in zinc activity in the forced swim test (FST) in mice and rats. The combined treatment of sub-effective doses of zinc (hydroaspartate, 2.5 mg Zn/kg) and citalopram (15 mg/kg), fluoxetine (5 mg/kg) but not with reboxetine (2.5 mg/kg) significantly reduces the immobility time in the FST in mice. These treatments had no influence on the spontaneous locomotor activity. Moreover, while the antidepressant-like effect of zinc (5 mg/kg) in the FST was significantly blocked by pretreatment with inhibitor of serotonin synthesis, p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA, 3x200 mg/kg), 5HT-2(A/C) receptor antagonist, ritanserin (4 mg/kg) or 5HT-1A receptor antagonist, WAY 1006335 (0.1 mg/kg), the zinc-induced reduction in the locomotor activity was not affected by these serotonin modulator agents. These results indicate the specific involvement of the serotonergic system in antidepressant but not the motion behavior of zinc in mice. Also, an increase in the swimming but not climbing parameter of the rat FST observed following zinc administration (2.5 and 5 mg Zn/kg) indicates the serotonin pathway participation. This present data indicates that the antidepressant-like activity of zinc observed in the FST involves interaction with the serotonergic system.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Szewczyk B ; Poleszak E ; Wlaź P ; Wróbel A ; Blicharska E ; Cichy A ; Dybała M ; Siwek A ; Pomierny-Chamioło L ; Piotrowska A ; Brański P ; Pilc A ; Nowak G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2008.12.011 ","Keywords":"Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors/pharmacology\r\nAnimals\r\n*Antidepressive Agents\r\nAspartic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology\r\nCitalopram/pharmacology\r\nFenclonine\r\nFluoxetine/pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMorpholines/pharmacology\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nOrganometallic Compounds/*pharmacology\r\nPiperazines/pharmacology\r\nPyridines/pharmacology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nReboxetine\r\nRitanserin/pharmacology\r\nSerotonin/*physiology\r\nSerotonin Agents\r\nSerotonin Antagonists/pharmacology\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/pharmacology\r\nSwimming/*psychology\r\nZinc Compounds/*pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Szewczyk B, Poleszak E, Wlaź P, Wróbel A, Blicharska E, Cichy A, Dybała M, Siwek A, Pomierny-Chamioło L, Piotrowska A, Brański P, Pilc A, and Nowak G (2009) The involvement of serotonergic system in the antidepressant effect of zinc in the forced swim test..

Zinc (Zn), which is a potent NMDA receptor antagonist, exerts antidepressant-like effects in screening tests and models of depression. We focused these studies in investigating whether activation of the mTOR signaling pathway is also a necessary mechanism of the antidepressant-like activity of Zn. We observed that a single injection of Zn (5 mg/kg) induced an increase in the phosphorylation of mTOR and p70S6K 30 min and 3 h after Zn treatment at time points when Zn produced also an antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim test (FST). Furthermore, Zn administered 3 h before the decapitation increased the level of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), GluA1 and synapsin I. An elevated level of GluA1 and synapsin I was still observed 24 h after the Zn treatment, although Zn did not produce any effects in the FST at that time point. We also observed that pretreatment with rapamycin (mTORC1 inhibitor), LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), H-89 (PKA inhibitor) and GF109203X (PKC inhibitor) blocked the antidepressant-like effect of Zn in FST in rats and blocks Zn-induced activation of mTOR signaling proteins (analyzed 30 min after Zn administration). These studies indicated that the antidepressant-like activity of Zn depends on the activation of mTOR signaling and other signaling pathways related to neuroplasticity, which can indirectly modulate mTOR function.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Szewczyk B ; Pochwat B ; Rafało A ; Palucha-Poniewiera A ; Domin H ; Nowak G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuropharm.2015.08.026 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nCyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nEnzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1\r\nMultiprotein Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism\r\nPhosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism\r\nPhosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors\r\nPhosphorylation/drug effects\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nProtein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nReceptors, AMPA/metabolism\r\nReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism\r\nRibosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/metabolism\r\nSignal Transduction/drug effects\r\nSynapsins/metabolism\r\nTOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism\r\nZinc/*pharmacology\r\nFST\r\nPI3K\r\nPKA\r\nPKC\r\nZinc\r\nmTOR","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Szewczyk B, Pochwat B, Rafało A, Palucha-Poniewiera A, Domin H, and Nowak G (2015) Activation of mTOR dependent signaling pathway is a necessary mechanism of antidepressant-like activity of zinc..

Therefore, the search for more effective antidepressants is still in progress. Antidepressant properties of magnesium and zinc have been demonstrated in animal screen tests/models and clinical studies. Moreover, these bio-elements enhance antidepressant activity of conventional antidepressants in these behavioral paradigms. As for magnesium, clinical studies demonstrated equivocal results concerning its supplementary effectiveness in the treatment of depression. Generally, some depressed patients with hypomagnesemia responded very well to such supplementation, whereas response of other patients was weaker. Clinical data on the effectiveness of zinc supplementation in the therapy of depression are much more robust. A number of studies demonstrated enhancement of the efficacy of pharmacotherapy by zinc supplementation in major depression. What is important, recent studies demonstrate that zinc supplementation augments efficacy of antidepressants also in treatment-resistant patients.

Unfortunately, these antidepressant effects are short-lived and patients usually relapse to baseline depression levels within 48 hours. Recent work suggests, however, that the use of lithium with early morning sleep deprivation sustains this rapid antidepressant effect and makes it clinically useful. In a 30-day study, we compared the abilities of four different treatments (lithium plus early morning sleep deprivation, lithium plus a control sleep deprivation procedure, and desipramine with either of the two sleep manipulations) to induce a rapid (next-day) and sustained antidepressant response in 16 depressed patients. Lithium plus early morning sleep deprivation produced a quicker response than lithium with the control sleep deprivation, and the response was sustained for at least 30 days. In this design, however, lithium/early morning sleep deprivation was no faster than either of the two desipramine/sleep deprivation conditions in inducing remission. These results support the results of previous studies and suggest further investigation of this novel sleep/pharmacologic intervention is warranted.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Szuba MP ; Baxter LR Jr; Altshuler LL ; Allen EM ; Guze BH ; Schwartz JM ; Liston EH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/0165-1781(94)90015-9 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnalysis of Variance\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/physiopathology/psychology/*therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSleep Deprivation/*physiology\r\nTime Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Szuba MP, Baxter LR Jr, Altshuler LL, Allen EM, Guze BH, Schwartz JM, and Liston EH (1994) Lithium sustains the acute antidepressant effects of sleep deprivation: preliminary findings from a controlled study..

Lithium is an established treatment for mood disorders, yet, its mechanism of action is partially understood. We investigated the effects of lithium on BBB integrity and NVU-related protein expression in chronic mild stress (CMS) rat model of depressive-like behavior. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were exposed for 5 weeks to unpredictable mild stressors with daily co-administration of lithium chloride to half of the stressed and unstressed groups. Sucrose preference and open field tests were conducted to validate the depressive-like phenotype, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI analysis was utilized to assess BBB integrity in brain regions relevant to the pathophysiology of depression. Hippocampal AQP4 and claudin-5 expression were studied using immunofluorescence, western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: Lithium administration to the stressed rats prevented the reductions in sucrose preference and distance traveled in the open field, and normalized the stress-induced hippocampal BBB hyperpermeability, whereas lithium administration to the unstressed rats increased hippocampal BBB permeability. Additionally, lithium treatment attenuated the decrease in hippocampal AQP4 to glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity ratio in the stressed rats and upregulated hippocampal claudin-5 and BDNF proteins expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that lithium administration in a rat CMS model of depressive-like behavior is associated with attenuation of stressed-induced hippocampal BBB/NVU disruption.

Several studies have looked at the association between magnesium and depression, yet its role in symptom management is unclear. The objective of this trial was to test whether supplementation with over-the-counter magnesium chloride improves symptoms of depression. An open-label, blocked, randomized, cross-over trial was carried out in outpatient primary care clinics on 126 adults (mean age 52; 38% male) diagnosed with and currently experiencing mild-to-moderate symptoms with Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores of 5-19. The intervention was 6 weeks of active treatment (248 mg of elemental magnesium per day) compared to 6 weeks of control (no treatment). Assessments of depression symptoms were completed at bi-weekly phone calls. The primary outcome was the net difference in the change in depression symptoms from baseline to the end of each treatment period. Secondary outcomes included changes in anxiety symptoms as well as adherence to the supplement regimen, appearance of adverse effects, and intention to use magnesium supplements in the future. Between June 2015 and May 2016, 112 participants provided analyzable data. Consumption of magnesium chloride for 6 weeks resulted in a clinically significant net improvement in PHQ-9 scores of -6.0 points (CI -7.9, -4.2; P<0.001) and net improvement in Generalized Anxiety Disorders-7 scores of -4.5 points (CI -6.6, -2.4; P<0.001). Average adherence was 83% by pill count. The supplements were well tolerated and 61% of participants reported they would use magnesium in the future. Similar effects were observed regardless of age, gender, baseline severity of depression, baseline magnesium level, or use of antidepressant treatments. Effects were observed within two weeks. Magnesium is effective for mild-to-moderate depression in adults. It works quickly and is well tolerated without the need for close monitoring for toxicity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tarleton EK ; Littenberg B ; MacLean CD ; Kennedy AG ; Daley C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0180067 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMagnesium Chloride/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tarleton EK, Littenberg B, MacLean CD, Kennedy AG, and Daley C (2017) Role of magnesium supplementation in the treatment of depression: A randomized clinical trial..

Magnesium supplementation is associated with improved depressive symptoms, but because the mechanism is unknown, it is unclear whether serum magnesium levels act as a biological predictor of the treatment outcome. Therefore, we sought to describe the relationship between serum magnesium and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ, a measure of depression) scores. A cross-sectional analysis of medical records from 3604 adults (mean age 62 years; 42% men) seen in primary care clinics between 2015 and 2018, with at least one completed PHQ were included. The relationship between serum magnesium and depression using univariate analyses showed a significant effect when measured by the PHQ-2 (-0.19 points/mg/dL; 95% CI -0.31, -0.07; P = 0.001) and the PHQ-9 (-0.93 points/mg/dL; 95% CI -1.81, -0.06; P = 0.037). This relationship was strengthened after adjusting for covariates (age, gender, race, time between serum magnesium and PHQ tests, and presence of diabetes and chronic kidney disease) (PHQ-2: -0.25 points/mg/dL; 95% CI -3.33, -0.09; P < 0.001 and PHQ-9: -1.09 95% CI -1.96 -0.21; P = 0.015). For adults seen in primary care, lower serum magnesium levels are associated with depressive symptoms, supporting the use of supplemental magnesium as therapy. Serum magnesium may help identify the biological mechanism of depressive symptoms and identify patients likely to respond to magnesium supplementation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tarleton EK ; Kennedy AG ; Rose GL ; Crocker A ; Littenberg B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu11071475 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\n*Affect\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nBiomarkers/blood\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/*blood/diagnosis/psychology\r\nElectronic Health Records\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMagnesium/*blood\r\nMagnesium Deficiency/*blood/diagnosis/psychology\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPatient Health Questionnaire\r\n*Primary Health Care\r\nRisk Assessment\r\nRisk Factors\r\nYoung Adult\r\ndepression\r\nmagnesium\r\nprimary care","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tarleton EK, Kennedy AG, Rose GL, Crocker A, and Littenberg B (2019) The Association between Serum Magnesium Levels and Depression in an Adult Primary Care Population..

Guidance is informed by the strength of evidence rather than by comparative data. METHOD: We performed a multiple-treatments meta-analysis of randomised, double-blind, controlled comparisons of 4-16 weeks in adults in bipolar depression. The primary efficacy outcome was effect size. The primary acceptability outcome was 'switch to mania'. Secondary outcomes were likelihood of response and withdrawals from trials. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were included (8331 participants). Olanzapine + fluoxetine and olanzapine performed best on primary outcome measure being ranked highest for effect size. Switch to mania was least likely with ziprasidone and then quetiapine. Olanzapine + fluoxetine was also ranked the highest for response with lurasidone second, but olanzapine + fluoxetine and olanzapine had the optimal effect on response and withdrawal from treatment when the two parameters were considered together. Several treatments [monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), ziprasidone, aripiprazole and risperidone] have limited or no therapeutic activity in bipolar depression. CONCLUSION: Olanzapine + fluoxetine should be first-line treatment. Olanzapine, quetiapine, lurasidone, valproate and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors are also recommended. Tricyclic antidepressants and lithium are worthy of consideration but lamotrigine (high risk of switching, less robust efficacy) and MAOIs, ziprasidone, aripiprazole and risperidone (no evidence of efficacy) should not be used.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Taylor DM ; Cornelius V ; Smith L ; Young AH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/acps.12343 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAripiprazole\r\nBenzodiazepines/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDibenzothiazepines/therapeutic use\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFluoxetine/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nIsoindoles/therapeutic use\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use\r\nLurasidone Hydrochloride\r\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/therapeutic use\r\nOlanzapine\r\nPiperazines/therapeutic use\r\nQuetiapine Fumarate\r\nQuinolones/therapeutic use\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nRisperidone/therapeutic use\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use\r\nThiazoles/therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nTriazines/therapeutic use\r\nValproic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nantidepressives\r\nantipsychotics\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ndepression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Taylor DM, Cornelius V, Smith L, and Young AH (2014) Comparative efficacy and acceptability of drug treatments for bipolar depression: a multiple-treatments meta-analysis..

A range of guidelines provide advice on treatment selection, prescription, monitoring and discontinuation, but variation in the content and quality of guidelines may limit the provision of objective, evidence-based care. This is of importance given the side effect burden and poorer long-term outcomes associated with polypharmacy and treatment-resistant depression. This review provides a definitive overview of pharmacological augmentation recommendations by assessing the quality of guidelines for depression and comparing the recommendations made. METHODS: A systematic literature search identified current treatment guidelines for depression published in English. Guidelines were quality assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool. Data relating to the prescription of pharmacological augmenters were extracted from those developed with sufficient rigor, and the included recommendations compared. RESULTS: Total of 1696 records were identified, 19 guidelines were assessed for quality, and 10 were included. Guidelines differed in their quality, the stage at which augmentation was recommended, the agents included, and the evidence base cited. Lithium and atypical antipsychotics were recommended by all 10, though the specific advice was not consistent. Of the 15 augmenters identified, no others were universally recommended. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a comprehensive overview of current pharmacological augmentation recommendations for major depression and will support clinicians in selecting appropriate treatment guidance. Although some variation can be accounted for by date of guideline publication, and limited evidence from clinical trials, there is a clear need for greater consistency across guidelines to ensure patients receive consistent evidence-based care.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Taylor RW ; Marwood L ; Oprea E ; DeAngel V ; Mather S ; Valentini B ; Zahn R ; Young AH ; Cleare AJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/ijnp/pyaa033 ","Keywords":"Antipsychotic Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Prescriptions/*standards\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nPractice Guidelines as Topic/*standards\r\nAugmentation\r\ndepression\r\nguideline\r\npharmacology\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Taylor RW, Marwood L, Oprea E, DeAngel V, Mather S, Valentini B, Zahn R, Young AH, and Cleare AJ (2020) Pharmacological Augmentation in Unipolar Depression: A Guide to the Guidelines..

Female Wistar rats (190-210 g) received either tap water alone (N = 156) or 20 mM LiCL provided chronically (30 days; N = 127) or acutely (5 days; N = 22) in the drinking water. Three days before the end of treatment, each group was divided into two subgroups which received either inescapable shock (IS) or no shock (NS) treatment in shuttle boxes. All groups were subsequently submitted to an escape test on the following day and then sacrificed one day after the escape test, when blood samples were taken to measure serum Li+, Na+ and K+ concentrations by flame photometry. There were no significant differences in serum Na+ amongst the 4 groups. Chronically treated NS and IS rats both presented an increase in serum K+ compared to the control rats. The IS and not the NS chronically treated rats presented increased serum Li+ levels which cannot be accounted for in terms of differences in Li+ intake. The IS group treated chronically with lithium had a better escape performance than the IS group receiving either tap water or acute Li+ administration. We conclude that chronic but not acute Li+ treatment at a serum level within the prophylactic range (0.5 mEq/l) is able to prevent learned helplessness in the rat. These results agree with the data obtained in clinical practice indicating that Li+ is only effective after chronic administration and that Li(+)-induced hyperkalemia is a side effect.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Teixeira NA ; Pereira DG ; Hermini AH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Analysis of Variance\r\nAnimals\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nEscape Reaction/*drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nLithium/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nPotassium/blood\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Teixeira NA, Pereira DG, and Hermini AH (1995) Chronic but not acute Li+ treatment prevents behavioral depression in rats..

The aim of the study was to compare plasma levels of these receptors in unmedicated bipolar depressed patients compared with healthy controls, and to evaluate the effects of a 6-week lithium treatment on sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 levels. METHODS: The study enrolled 29 patients with unmedicated bipolar disorder in a major depressive episode and 27 matched controls. Patients had blood collected at baseline and after 6 weeks of lithium treatment. The concentration of sTNFRs was measured by ELISA. RESULTS: sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 levels were significantly increased in bipolar depression in comparison with healthy subjects. Lithium treatment did not significantly change sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 levels from baseline to endpoint. There was no correlation between improvement in depressive symptoms and the change in sTNFR1 or sTNFR1 levels. CONCLUSION: These results reinforce the involvement of an activated immune response system in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder, with no impact of lithium treatment on the related biomarkers.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Teixeira AL ; de Sousa RT ; Zanetti MV ; Brunoni AR ; Busatto GF ; Zarate CA Jr; Gattaz WF ; Machado-Vieira R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/hup.2450 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBipolar Disorder/*blood/*drug therapy\r\nCase-Control Studies\r\nEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nPhlebotomy\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nReceptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I/*blood\r\nReceptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II/*blood\r\nStatistics, Nonparametric\r\nYoung Adult\r\nbipolar depression\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nlithium\r\nsTNFR1\r\nsTNFR2","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Teixeira AL, de Sousa RT, Zanetti MV, Brunoni AR, Busatto GF, Zarate CA Jr, Gattaz WF, and Machado-Vieira R (2015) Increased plasma levels of soluble TNF receptors 1 and 2 in bipolar depression and impact of lithium treatment..

Misdiagnosis of major depressive disorder delays initiation of appropriate therapy, further worsening prognosis. Distinguishing features of bipolar depression include earlier age of onset, a family history of bipolar disorder, presence of psychotic or reverse neurovegetative features, and antidepressant-induced switching. Bipolar I depressions should initially be treated with a mood stabilizer (carbamazapine, divalproex, lamotrigine, lithium, or an atypical antipsychotic); antidepressant monotherapy is contraindicated. More severe or \"breakthrough\" episodes often require a concomitant antidepressant, such as bupropion or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). The first treatment specifically approved for bipolar depression is a combination of the SSRI fluoxetine and the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine. For refractory depressive episodes, venlafaxine, the monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine, and ECT are most widely recommended. The optimal duration of maintenance antidepressant therapy has not been established empirically and, until better evidence-based guidelines are established, should be determined on a case-by-case basis.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Thase ME ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/10673220500326425 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/classification/*diagnosis/drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/classification/diagnosis/drug therapy\r\nDiagnosis, Differential\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nPrognosis","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Thase ME (2005) Bipolar depression: issues in diagnosis and treatment..

Although the disorder is defined by the manic and hypomanic episodes, for most people the depression episodes are the more virulent aspect of the illness. Specifically, the depressive episodes are more numerous, last longer, and are more difficult to treat than the manias, and depression is the principal cause of the illness's increased mortality due to suicide. For people with early-onset depression, predictors of subsequent bipolarity include a family history, psychotic features, and reverse neurovegetative features. Initial episodes of depression are commonly misdiagnosed, which often delays initiation of appropriate therapy and increases the likelihood of treatment with antidepressants alone. Unfortunately, the correct diagnosis is often not made until there has been a treatment-emergent affective switch. There are no treatments specifically approved for bipolar disorder in youth and, among antidepressants, only fluoxetine has received approved. When bipolarity is suspected, treatment with mood stabilizers, both conventional (i.e., lithium, valproate, and carbamazapine) and more recently classified (lamotrigine) and atypical antipsychotics should be prioritized. When antidepressants are indicated in combination with mood stabilizers, first choice options include bupropion and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Studies of adults indicate that several forms of focused psychotherapy may improve longer term outcomes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Thase ME ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S0954579406060585 ","Keywords":"Age of Onset\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*diagnosis/psychology/*therapy\r\nChild\r\nDepressive Disorder/*diagnosis/*therapy\r\nDiagnosis, Differential\r\nGABA Agents/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nPrevalence\r\nPsychotherapy\r\nValproic Acid/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Thase ME (2006) Bipolar depression: diagnostic and treatment considerations..

Major strategies for managing treatment-resistant depression include switching to another antidepressant or augmenting the initial antidepressant with another medication. Switching may be appropriate for patients experiencing little or no symptom relief or intolerable side effects with the initial antidepressant. For patients who experience partial response from the first-line antidepressant, adjunctive therapies avoid the loss of this response and the wash-out and cross-titration that are required when switching antidepressants. Several effective antidepressant augmentation agents are available, including lithium, thyroid hormone, anti-anxiety medications, and atypical antipsychotics. The evidence for the efficacy and risks of these strategies is discussed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Thase ME ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.10126tx4c ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination/methods/*psychology\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Thase ME (2012) Using adjunctive treatments when first-line antidepressants fail..

Research over the past few years suggests that a variety of nutrients may have an important role in the phase related mood and behavioral disturbances of the premenstrual syndrome. There is scientific evidence, at least for a few of these micronutrients, specifically calcium and vitamin D, supporting cyclic fluctuations during the menstrual cycle that may help explain some features of PMS. Ovarian hormones influence calcium, magnesium and vitamin D metabolism. Estrogen regulates calcium metabolism, intestinal calcium absorption and parathyroid gene expression and secretion, triggering fluctuations across the menstrual cycle. Alterations in calcium homeostasis (hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia) have long been associated with many affective disturbances. PMS shares many features of depression, anxiety and the dysphoric states. The similarity between the symptoms of PMS and hypocalcemia is remarkable. Clinical trials in women with PMS have found that calcium supplementation effectively alleviates the majority of mood and somatic symptoms. Evidence to date indicates that women with luteal phase symptomatology have an underlying calcium dysregulation with a secondary hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency. This strongly suggests that PMS represents the clinical manifestation of a calcium deficiency state that is unmasked following the rise of ovarian steroid hormone concentrations during the menstrual cycle.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Thys-Jacobs S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/07315724.2000.10718920 ","Keywords":"Calcitriol/physiology\r\nCalcium/physiology\r\nDepression\r\nFemale\r\nHomeostasis\r\nHumans\r\nMagnesium/physiology\r\nMenstrual Cycle/physiology\r\n*Premenstrual Syndrome\r\n*Vitamins","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Thys-Jacobs S (2000) Micronutrients and the premenstrual syndrome: the case for calcium..

In this paper, we review the most compelling clinical, biologic, and genetic predictors of lithium response in bipolar disorder. Among clinical factors, the strongest predictors of good response are fewer hospitalizations preceding treatment, an episodic course characterized by an illness pattern of mania followed by depression, and a later age at onset of bipolar disorder. While several biologic predictors have been studied, the results are preliminary and require replication with studies of larger patient samples over longer observation periods. Neuroimaging is a particularly promising method given that it might concurrently illuminate pathophysiologic underpinnings of bipolar disorder, the mechanism of action of lithium, and potential predictors of lithium response. The first genome-wide association study of lithium response was recently completed. No definitive results emerged, perhaps because the study was underpowered. With major new initiatives in progress aiming to identify genes and genetic variations associated with lithium response, there is much reason to be hopeful that clinically useful information might be generated within the next several years. This could ultimately translate into tests that could guide the choice of mood-stabilizing medication for patients. In addition, it might facilitate pharmacologic research aimed at developing newer, more effective medications that might act more quickly and yield fewer side effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tighe SK ; Mahon PB ; Potash JB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/2040622311399173 ","Keywords":"bipolar disorder\r\ngenetics\r\nlithium\r\nneuroimaging\r\npredicting response","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tighe SK, Mahon PB, and Potash JB (2011) Predictors of lithium response in bipolar disorder..

We aimed to study the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments in relapse prevention in a nationwide cohort of patients who had been admitted to hospital at least once as a result of unipolar depression. METHODS: Our nationwide cohort study investigated the risk of readmission to hospital in 1996-2012 in all patients in Finland who had been admitted to hospital at least once for unipolar depression (without a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) in Finland between Jan 1, 1987, and Dec 31, 2012. We used nationwide databases to obtain data for hospital admission, mortality, and dispensed medications. Exposure and non-exposure periods for medications were established using the PRE2DUP method. The primary analysis was within-individual analysis of readmission to hospital in the total cohort, in which each individual was used as his or her own control to eliminate selection bias. Putative survival and protopathic biases were controlled in sensitivity analyses. Since 33 independent statistical comparisons were done for specific medications, the level of statistical significance was set at p<0·0015. FINDINGS: Data from 123 712 patients were included in the total cohort, with a mean follow-up time of 7·9 years (SD 5·3). Lithium use was associated with a lower risk of re-admission to hospital for mental illness than was no lithium use (hazard ratio [HR] 0·47 [95% CI 0·40-0·55]; p<0·0001), whereas the groups of antidepressants (HR 1·10 [1·06-1·13]; p<0·0001) and antipsychotics (HR 1·16 [1·12-1·20]; p<0·0001) were not associated with a reduced risk of readmission to hospital. Risk of hospital readmission was lower during lithium therapy alone (HR 0·31 [0·21-0·47]; p<0·0001) than during use of lithium with antidepressants (HR 0·50 [0·43-0·59]; p<0·0001). After lithium, clozapine (HR 0·65 [0·46-0·90]; p=0·010) and amitriptyline (HR 0·75 [0·70-0·81]; p<0·0001) were the specific agents associated with the next lowest risk of readmission. In the sensitivity analyses controlling for survival and protopathic biases, all drugs were associated with lower rates of readmission to hospital than they were in the primary analysis, showing the same rank order in comparative effectiveness. The lowest mortality was observed during antidepressant use (HR 0·56 [0·54-0·58]; p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that lithium, especially without concomitant antidepressant use, is the pharmacological treatment associated with the lowest risk of hospital readmission for mental illness in patients with severe unipolar depression, and the outcomes for this measure related to antidepressants and antipsychotics are poorer than lithium. Lithium treatment should be considered for a wider population of severely depressed patients than those currently considered, taking into account its potential risks and side-effects.

METHOD: Patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (manic/mixed), a history of two or more manic or mixed episodes within 6 years, and a Young Mania Rating Scale total score > or =20 entered the study and received open-label co-treatment with olanzapine and lithium for 6-12 weeks. Those meeting symptomatic remission criteria (Young Mania Rating Scale score < or =12; 21-item Hamilton depression scale score < or =8) were randomly assigned to 52 weeks of double-blind monotherapy with olanzapine, 5-20 mg/day (N=217), or lithium (target blood level: 0.6-1.2 meq/liter) (N=214). RESULTS: Symptomatic relapse/recurrence (score > or =15 on either the Young Mania Rating Scale or Hamilton depression scale) occurred in 30.0% of olanzapine-treated and 38.8% of lithium-treated patients. The noninferiority of olanzapine relative to lithium (primary objective) in preventing relapse/recurrence was met, since the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval on the 8.8% risk difference (-0.1% to 17.8%) exceeded the predefined noninferiority margin (-7.3%). Secondary results showed that compared with lithium, olanzapine had significantly lower risks of manic episode and mixed episode relapse/recurrence. Depression relapse/recurrence occurred in 15.7% of olanzapine-treated and 10.7% of lithium-treated patients. Mean weight gain during open-label co-treatment was 2.7 kg; during double-blind monotherapy, weight gain was significantly greater with olanzapine (1.8 kg) than with lithium (-1.4 kg). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that olanzapine was significantly more effective than lithium in preventing manic and mixed episode relapse/recurrence in patients acutely stabilized with olanzapine and lithium co-treatment. Both agents were comparable in preventing depression relapse/recurrence.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tohen M ; Greil W ; Calabrese JR ; Sachs GS ; Yatham LN ; Oerlinghausen BM ; Koukopoulos A ; Cassano GB ; Grunze H ; Licht RW ; Dell'Osso L ; Evans AR ; Risser R ; Baker RW ; Crane H ; Dossenbach MR ; Bowden CL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ajp.162.7.1281 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBenzodiazepines/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/chemically induced/drug therapy/*prevention & control/psychology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nMale\r\nOlanzapine\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSecondary Prevention\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tohen M, Greil W, Calabrese JR, Sachs GS, Yatham LN, Oerlinghausen BM, Koukopoulos A, Cassano GB, Grunze H, Licht RW, Dell'Osso L, Evans AR, Risser R, Baker RW, Crane H, Dossenbach MR, and Bowden CL (2005) Olanzapine versus lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder: a 12-month, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial..

The aim of the present study was to develop the Multi-state Outcome Analysis of Treatments (MOAT), to provide more pragmatic information for clinicians and investigators in guiding maintenance treatment decisions. The present study was one of two published studies on the development of MOAT procedures, involving a one-year comparison of olanzapine versus lithium in recently manic patients. METHODS: MOAT partitions total survival time into clinically distinct periods that are operationally defined by cut points on established rating scales. For bipolar disorders, the clinical states are remission, subsyndromal and syndromal mania, mixed states, and subsyndromal and syndromal depression. RESULTS: MOAT re-analyses of the clinical trial revealed clinically important findings not identified when utilizing Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Compared to patients treated with lithium, patients taking olanzapine experienced significantly more time in subsyndromal depression. Patients taking lithium spent significantly more time in mixed states than did patients taking olanzapine. CONCLUSIONS: MOAT provided detailed information on treatment outcomes that was not provided by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Its capability to identify and aggregate time in different clinical states of bipolar disorder may aid in identifying drug effects that are important in selecting and conducting maintenance treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tohen M ; Mintz J ; Bowden CL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/bdi.12383 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBenzodiazepines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*psychology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nKaplan-Meier Estimate\r\nLithium Compounds/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOlanzapine\r\nOutcome Assessment, Health Care/statistics & numerical data\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales/statistics & numerical data\r\nPsychometrics\r\nYoung Adult\r\nbipolar disorder\r\noutcome analysis\r\ntreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tohen M, Mintz J, and Bowden CL (2016) Analysis of bipolar maintenance treatment with lithium versus olanzapine utilizing Multi-state Outcome Analysis of Treatments (MOAT)..

This paper deals with an 'opposite' strategy, i.e. the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) during maintenance lithium treatment in bipolar disorder (BP) patients who may present a breakthrough depressive syndrome. The study involved 26 patients on maintenance lithium treatment for a mean of 38 months (mean serum lithium level=0.57 mEq/l). Mean fluoxetine dose was 29.3 mg/day for a mean period of 7.36 weeks. Median HDRS scores before and after fluoxetine augmentation were 14 and 6, respectively. The results provide evidence for the efficacy of fluoxetine augmentation in the treatment of breakthrough depressions occurring in bipolar disorder patients during maintenance lithium treatment. The neuropharmacological explanation of the augmentation is not yet well understood, but it is conceivable that the improvement of the depressive symptoms may be related to the increase in serotonergic function provided by combination of the two treatments.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tondo L ; Mannu P ; Silvetti F ; Altamura CA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3109/13651509709024727 ","Keywords":"bipolar disorders\r\nbreakthrough depression\r\nfluoxetine\r\nlithium","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tondo L, Mannu P, Silvetti F, and Altamura CA (1997) Fluoxetine augmentation in bipolar disorder patients on maintenance lithium treatment..

METHOD: Risk of life-threatening suicidal acts over time and associated factors were analyzed in 310 patients with DSM-IV bipolar I (N = 186) or II (N = 124) disorder evaluated for a mean of 8.3 years before, and prospectively during, a mean of 6.4 years of lithium maintenance in a mood disorder clinic; 185 were also followed for a mean of 3.7 years after clinically discontinuing lithium. RESULTS: In 5233 patient-years of observation, 58 patients made 90 suicide attempts (8 were fatal). Survival analyses with Weibull modeling with adjustments for covariates indicated a highly significant 6.4-fold adjusted hazard ratio during versus before and 7.5-fold ratio after versus during lithium maintenance. Suicidal acts were more common early in the course of illness before lithium and were associated with prior suicide attempts, greater proportion of time depressed, and younger age. After the discontinuation of lithium, suicidal acts were more frequent in the first year than at later times or before start of lithium treatment. Fatalities were 9 times more frequent after versus during treatment. CONCLUSION: Lithium maintenance was associated with marked reduction of life-threatening suicidal acts, the number of which sharply increased after discontinuing lithium. Suicidal behavior was strongly associated with prior suicide attempts, more time depressed, and younger age or recent onset. Greater attention to suicidal risk in patients with bipolar depression and assessment of all proposed mood-stabilizing agents for antisuicidal effects are strongly encouraged.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tondo L ; Baldessarini RJ ; Hennen J ; Floris G ; Silvetti F ; Tohen M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/jcp.v59n0802 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAge Factors\r\nAged\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/*prevention & control/psychology\r\nChild\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nItaly/epidemiology\r\nLithium/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nProspective Studies\r\nRisk Assessment\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/epidemiology/prevention & control\r\nSuicide/*statistics & numerical data\r\nSuicide, Attempted/prevention & control/statistics & numerical data\r\nSurvival Analysis\r\nSuicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tondo L, Baldessarini RJ, Hennen J, Floris G, Silvetti F, and Tohen M (1998) Lithium treatment and risk of suicidal behavior in bipolar disorder patients..

METHOD: Clinical research records of 317 patients with DSM-IV-defined bipolar disorder (188 with type I and 129 with type II) were analyzed for frequency and duration of affective episodes and hospitalizations before (mean = 8.38 years) versus during (mean = 6.35 years) lithium maintenance treatment. Treatment effects were also assessed by survival analysis of interepisode intervals and by multivariate regression testing for factors associated with response to treatment. RESULTS: Bipolar I and bipolar II patients were ill before treatment a similar percentage of time, but the subtype distinction was supported descriptively. Lithium had superior benefits in type II patients, with significantly greater reduction of episodes per year and of the percentage of time ill. Reduction of depressive morbidity was similarly strong in both diagnostic types. During treatment, bipolar II patients had 5.9-fold longer interepisode intervals and were twice as likely as type I patients to have no new episodes. Starting lithium maintenance earlier predicted greater improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Lithium maintenance yielded striking long-term reductions of depressive as well as manic morbidity in both bipolar disorder subtypes, with greater overall benefits in type II patients and with earlier treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tondo L ; Baldessarini RJ ; Hennen J ; Floris G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/ajp.155.5.638 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAge of Onset\r\nBipolar Disorder/classification/epidemiology/*prevention & control\r\nDepressive Disorder/epidemiology/*prevention & control\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nItaly/epidemiology\r\nLithium Carbonate/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nProspective Studies\r\nRegression Analysis\r\nSurvival Analysis\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tondo L, Baldessarini RJ, Hennen J, and Floris G (1998) Lithium maintenance treatment of depression and mania in bipolar I and bipolar II disorders..

It is also potentially fatal as a result of accidents and increased mortality associated with comorbid substance use and medical illnesses, but its highest lethality results from suicide. Suicide rates, averaging 0.4% per year in men and women diagnosed with bipolar disorder, are >20-fold higher than in the general population. Suicidal acts often occur early in the illness course and in association with severe depressive and dysphoric-agitated mixed phases of illness, especially following repeated, severe depressions. Systematic consideration of risk and protective factors enhances assessment of potentially suicidal patients. Short-term interventions employed empirically to manage acute suicidality include close clinical supervision, rapid hospitalisation and use of electroconvulsive treatment. Several plausible therapeutic interventions have limited evidence of long-term effectiveness against mortality risks associated with any psychiatric disorder, including antidepressant, antimanic, antipsychotic and electroconvulsive, as well as psychosocial, treatments. However, in bipolar disorder and other major affective disorders, lithium maintenance treatment is a notable exception, with strong and consistent evidence that it reduces suicidal risk. The growing range of drugs being introduced to treat acute and long-term phases of bipolar disorder, including antiepileptic drugs, atypical antipsychotics and relatively safe, modern antidepressants, require research assessment for their ability to limit premature mortality from suicide and other causes. For now, however, more can be done to improve treatment in major affective illnesses by application of current knowledge in a systematic fashion, with close and sustained clinical follow-up of patients at risk, hopefully with a resulting reduction of mortality rates.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tondo L ; Isacsson G ; Baldessarini R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2165/00023210-200317070-00003 ","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/complications/epidemiology/*psychology/therapy\r\nHumans\r\nRisk Assessment\r\n*Risk Factors\r\nSuicide/statistics & numerical data\r\n*Suicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tondo L, Isacsson G, and Baldessarini R (2003) Suicidal behaviour in bipolar disorder: risk and prevention..

A rare intervention with evidence of suicide risk-reducing as well as mood-stabilizing effects in mood disorder patients is lithium. METHODS: We reviewed available research evidence on associations of long-term treatment with lithium with risk of suicidal behavior. We meta-analyzed 12 randomized trials in 10 reports (with at least 1 suicide in either treatment arm) including both BD and MDD subjects, with particular attention to comparisons of lithium with placebo or other pharmacological treatments. We also summarized ecological studies on lithium concentration in local drinking water and reported suicide rates. RESULTS: We found substantial reduction of risks of suicide and attempts with long-term lithium treatment, particularly in depressive phases of BD and in MDD. Risk of suicidal behavior was higher in mixed (agitated-dysphoric) states than in manic or hypomanic periods. Risk of suicide fatality, specifically, was lower with lithium than with placebo and probably with mood-altering anticonvulsants or antidepressants. DISCUSSION: Long-term treatment with lithium has growing evidence of suicide- and attempt-sparing effects, probably greater than with anticonvulsants or antidepressants; antipsychotics remain to be tested adequately. However, the ethical and scientifically adequate design and conduct of trials of treatments aimed at suicide prevention remain challenging and underdeveloped.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tondo L ; Baldessarini RJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1055/a-0596-7853 ","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use\r\nMood Disorders/*drug therapy/*psychology\r\n*Suicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tondo L, and Baldessarini RJ (2018) Antisuicidal Effects in Mood Disorders: Are They Unique to Lithium?.

It is timely to review of the status of suicide in BD and to consider the possibility of limiting suicidal risk. METHODS: We carried out a semi-systematic review of recent research reports pertaining to suicide in BD. FINDINGS: Suicide risk in BD is greater than with most other psychiatric disorders. Suicide rates (per 100,000/year) are approximately 11 and 4 in the adult and juvenile general populations, but over 200 in adults, and 100 among juveniles diagnosed with BD. Suicide attempt rates with BD are at least 20 times higher than in the adult general population, and over 50 times higher among juveniles. Notable suicidal risk factors in BD include: previous suicidal acts, depression, mixed-agitated-dysphoric moods, rapid mood-shifts, impulsivity, and co-occurring substance abuse. Suicide-preventing therapeutics for BD remain severely underdeveloped. Evidence favoring lithium treatment is stronger than for other measures, although encouraging findings are emerging for other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Suicide is a leading clinical challenge for those caring for BD patients. Improved understanding of risk and protective factors combined with knowledge and close follow-up of BD patients should limit suicidal risk. Ethically appropriate and scientifically sound studies of plausible medicinal, physical, and psychosocial treatments aimed at suicide prevention specifically for BD patients are urgently needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tondo L ; Vázquez GH ; Baldessarini RJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/bdi.13017 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/complications/epidemiology\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major\r\nHumans\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSuicidal Ideation\r\nSuicide, Attempted\r\nattempts\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nlethality\r\nprevention\r\nsuicide\r\ntreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tondo L, Vázquez GH, and Baldessarini RJ (2021) Prevention of suicidal behavior in bipolar disorder..

The aim of the current review is to provide an update regarding the efficacy and safety of nutraceutical agents in mood disorders and to highlight considerations for future research. RECENT FINDINGS: Nutraceuticals such as omega-3, probiotics, zinc, saffron and curcumin have been recommended as adjunctive interventions to standard treatments for people with depression, while St John's wort has been recommended as a monotherapy. In contrast, less research has been devoted to investigating the effect of nutraceuticals in bipolar disorder, with omega-3 being weakly recommended as an adjunctive to standard treatments. Although the safety profile of most nutraceuticals appears acceptable, more insight into the long-term effects within a range of cohorts is recommended. SUMMARY: There are a number of nutraceuticals that have clinical trial support for their use as either adjunctive interventions for depression; however, there is mostly limited support for their use in bipolar disorder. Further randomized controlled trials that take into consideration a number of emerging mechanisms, potential nutraceutical combinations and factors that may predict treatment response are required to inform clinical use.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Travica N ; Teasdale S ; Marx W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/YCO.0000000000000826 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nMood Disorders/drug therapy\r\n*Hypericum\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Travica N, Teasdale S, and Marx W (2023) Nutraceuticals in mood disorders: current knowledge and future directions..

Accumulating evidence is also delineating a neuroprotective and neurotrophic role for lithium. However, its primary effects on cognitive functioning remain ambiguous. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper is to review and combine the relevant translational studies, focusing on the putative cognitive enhancement properties of lithium, specifically on learning, memory, and attention. DISCUSSION: These properties are also discussed in reference to research demonstrating a protective action of lithium against cognitive deficits induced by various challenges to the nervous system, such as stress, trauma, neurodegenerative disorders, and psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested on the basis of the evidence that the cognitive effects of lithium are best expressed and should, therefore, be sought under conditions of functional or biological challenge to the nervous system.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tsaltas E ; Kontis D ; Boulougouris V ; Papadimitriou GN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00213-008-1311-8 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntimanic Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior/drug effects\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nCognition/*drug effects\r\nHumans\r\nLearning/drug effects\r\nLithium Chloride/*pharmacology\r\nMemory/drug effects\r\nReward","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tsaltas E, Kontis D, Boulougouris V, and Papadimitriou GN (2009) Lithium and cognitive enhancement: leave it or take it?.

METHODS: Original studies, clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses addressing pharmacological treatment for TRD in adult patients published from 1990 to 2013 were identified by data base queries (PubMed, Google Scholar e Quertle Searches) using terms: \"treatment resistant depression\", \"treatment refractory depression\", \"partial response depression\", \"non responder depression\", \"optimization strategy\", \"switching strategy\", \"combination strategy\", \"augmentation strategy\", selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors antidepressants (SSRI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors antidepressants, mirtazapine, mianserine, bupropione, monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressant (MAOI), lithium, thyroid hormones, second generation antipsychotics (SGA), dopamine agonists, lamotrigine, psychostimulants, dextromethorphan, dextrorphan, ketamine, omega-3 fatty acids, S-adenosil-L-metionine, methylfolat, pindolol, sex steroids, glucocorticoid agents. Other citations of interest were further identified from references reported in the accessed articles. Selected publications were grouped by treatment strategy: (1) switching from an ineffective antidepressant (AD) to a new AD from a similar or different class; (2) combining the current AD regimen with a second AD from a different class; and (3) augmenting the current AD regimen with a second agent not thought to be an antidepressant itself. RESULTS: Switching from a TCA to another TCA provides only a modest advantage (response rate 9%-27%), while switching from a SSRI to another SSRI is more advantageous (response rate up to 75%). Evidence supports the usefulness of switching from SSRI to venlafaxine (5 positive trials out 6), TCA (2 positive trials out 3), and MAOI (2 positive trials out 2) but not from SSRI to bupropione, duloxetine and mirtazapine. Three reviews demonstrated that the benefits of intra- and cross-class switch do not significantly differ. Data on combination strategy are controversial regarding TCA-SSRI combination (positive results in old studies, negative in more recent study) and bupropion-SSRI combination (three open series studies but not three controlled trails support the useful of this combination) and positive regard mirtazapine (or its analogue mianserine) combination with ADs of different classes. As regards the augmentation strategy, available evidences supported the efficacy of TCA augmentation with lithium salts and thyroid hormone (T3), but are conflicting regard the SSRI augmentation with these two drugs (1 positive trial out of 4 for lithium and 3 out of 5 for thyroid hormone). Double-blind controlled studies showed the efficacy of AD augmentation with aripiprazole (5 positive trials out 5), quetiapine (3 positive trials out 3) and, at less extent, of fluoxetine augmentation with olanzapine (3 positive trials out 6), so these drugs received the FDA indication for the acute treatment of TRD. Results on AD augmentation with risperidone are conflicting (2 short term positive trials, 1 short-term and 1 long-term negative trials). Case series and open-label trials showed that AD augmentation with pramipexole or ropinirole, two dopamine agonists, could be an effective treatment for TRD (response rate to pramipexole 48%-74%, to ropinirole 40%-44%) although one recent double-blind placebo-controlled study does not support the superiority of pramipexole over placebo. Evidences do not justify the use of psychostimulants, omega-3 fatty acids, S-adenosil-L-metionine, methylfolate, pindolol, lamotrigine, and sex hormone as AD augmentation for TRD. Combining the available evidences with our experience we suggest treating non-responders to one SSRI bupropion or mirtazapine trial by switching to venlafaxine, and non-responders to one venlafaxine trial by switching to a TCA or, if TCA are not tolerated, combining mirtazapine with SSRI or venlafaxine. In non-responders to two or more ADs (including at least one TCA if tolerated) current AD regimen could be augmented with lithium salts (mainly in patients with bipolar depression or suicidality), SGAs (mostly aripiprazole) or DA-agonists (mostly pramipexole). In patients with severe TRD, i.e., non-responders to combination and augmentation strategies as well as to electroconvulsive therapy if workable, we suggest to try a combination plus augmentation strategy. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies alternative effective treatment strategies for TRD. Further studies are needed to compare the efficacy of different strategies in more homogeneous subpopulations.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tundo A ; de Filippis R ; Proietti L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.5498/wjp.v5.i3.330 ","Keywords":"Antidepressants\r\nAugmentation\r\nCombination\r\nDopamine-agonists\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nNon responder depression\r\nPartial response depression\r\nSecond generation antipsychotics\r\nSwitching\r\nTreatment resistant depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tundo A, de Filippis R, and Proietti L (2015) Pharmacologic approaches to treatment resistant depression: Evidences and personal experience..

This metal is a component of many structural as well as regulatory and catalytic proteins. The precise regulation of zinc homeostasis is essential for central nervous system and for the whole organism. Zinc plays a significant role in the brain development and in the proper brain function at every stage of life. This article is a review of knowledge about the role of zinc in central nervous system (CNS) function. The influence of this biometal on etiopathogenesis, prevention and treatment of selected brain diseases and disorders was discussed. Zinc imbalance can result not only from insufficient dietary intake, but also from impaired activity of zinc transport proteins and zinc dependent regulation of metabolic pathways. It is known that some neurodegenerative processes are connected with zinc dyshomeostasis and it may influence the state of Alzheimer's disease, depression and ageing-connected loss of cognitive function. The exact role of zinc and zinc-binding proteins in CNS pathogenesis processes is being under intensive investigation. The appropriate zinc supplementation in brain diseases may help in the prevention as well as in the proper treatment of several brain dysfunctions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tyszka-Czochara M ; Grzywacz A ; Gdula-Argasińska J ; Librowski T ; Wiliński B ; Opoka W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Alzheimer Disease/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nAnimals\r\nCarrier Proteins/metabolism\r\nCation Transport Proteins/metabolism\r\nCentral Nervous System/drug effects/*metabolism/physiopathology\r\nCentral Nervous System Diseases/drug therapy/*metabolism/physiopathology\r\nDepression/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nHomeostasis\r\nHumans\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/therapeutic use\r\nZinc/deficiency/*metabolism/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tyszka-Czochara M, Grzywacz A, Gdula-Argasińska J, Librowski T, Wiliński B, and Opoka W (2014) The role of zinc in the pathogenesis and treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases.

METHODS: With reports of controlled trials identified by systematic searching of Medline, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO literature databases, we summarized responses with lithium and controls followed by selective random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: We identified 36 reports with 39 randomized controlled trials: six for monotherapy and 12 for adding lithium to antidepressants for acute major depression, and 21 for long-term treatment. Data for monotherapy of acute depression were few and inconclusive. As an adjunct to antidepressants, lithium was much more effective than placebo ( p<0.0001). For long-term maintenance treatment, lithium was more effective than placebo in monotherapy ( p=0.011) and to supplement antidepressants ( p=0.038), and indistinguishable from antidepressant monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate efficacy of lithium as a treatment for some aspects of major depressive disorder, especially as an add-on to antidepressants and for long-term prophylaxis. It remains uncertain whether some benefits of lithium treatment occur with many major depressive disorder patients, or if efficacy is particular to a subgroup with bipolar disorder-like characteristics or mixed-features.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Undurraga J ; Sim K ; Tondo L ; Gorodischer A ; Azua E ; Tay KH ; Tan D ; Baldessarini RJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0269881118822161 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*administration & dosage\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nLithium\r\nsystematic review\r\nunipolar major depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Undurraga J, Sim K, Tondo L, Gorodischer A, Azua E, Tay KH, Tan D, and Baldessarini RJ (2019) Lithium treatment for unipolar major depressive disorder: Systematic review..

This study compared the acute effects of lamotrigine and placebo as add-on therapy to ongoing treatment with lithium in patients with bipolar depression. METHOD: Outpatients (N = 124) aged 18 years and older with a DSM-IV bipolar I or II disorder and a major depressive episode (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score > or = 18 and Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar Version [CGI-BP] severity of depression score > or = 4) while receiving lithium treatment (0.6-1.2 mmol/L) were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with lamotrigine (titrated to 200 mg/d) or placebo. The primary outcome measure was mean change from baseline in total score on the MADRS at week 8. Secondary outcome measures were response (defined as a reduction of > or = 50% on the MADRS and/or change of depression score on the CGI-BP of \"much improved\" or \"very much improved\" compared to baseline) and switch to mania or hypomania (defined as a CGI-BP severity of mania score of at least mildly ill at any visit). Patients were included in the study between August 2002 (Spain started in October 2003) and May 2005. RESULTS: Endpoint mean change from baseline MADRS total score was -15.38 (SE = 1.32) points for lamotrigine and -11.03 (SE = 1.36) points for placebo (t = -2.29, df = 104, p = .024). Significantly more patients responded to lamotrigine than to placebo on the MADRS (51.6% vs. 31.7%, p = .030), but not on the CGI-BP change of depression (64.1% vs. 49.2%, p = .105). Switch to mania or hypomania occurred in 5 patients (7.8%) receiving lamotrigine and 2 patients (3.3%) receiving placebo (p = .441). CONCLUSION: Lamotrigine was found effective and safe as add-on treatment to lithium in the acute treatment of bipolar depression.

New and efficacious treatments have not been forthcoming partly due to a lack of well-validated models representing both facets of BD. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that cholinergic- and dopaminergic-pharmacological manipulations would model depression and mania respectively, each attenuated by lithium treatment. METHODS: C57BL/6 J mice received the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine or saline before testing for \"behavioral despair\" (immobility) in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swim test (FST). Physostigmine effects on exploration and sensorimotor gating were assessed using the cross-species behavioral pattern monitor (BPM) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) paradigms. Other C57BL/6 J mice received chronic lithium drinking water (300, 600, or 1200 mg/l) before assessing their effects alone in the BPM or with physostigmine on FST performance. Another group was tested with acute GBR12909 (dopamine transporter inhibitor) and chronic lithium (1000 mg/l) in the BPM. RESULTS: Physostigmine (0.03 mg/kg) increased immobility in the TST and FST without affecting activity, exploration, or PPI. Lithium (600 mg/l) resulted in low therapeutic serum concentrations and normalized the physostigmine-increased immobility in the FST. GBR12909 induced mania-like behavior in the BPM of which hyper-exploration was attenuated, though not reversed, after chronic lithium (1000 mg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Increased cholinergic levels induced depression-like behavior and hyperdopaminergia induced mania-like behavior in mice, while chronic lithium treated some, but not all, facets of these effects. These data support a cholinergic-monoaminergic mechanism for modeling BD aspects and provide a way to assess novel therapeutics.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"van Enkhuizen J ; Milienne-Petiot M ; Geyer MA ; Young JW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00213-015-4000-4 ","Keywords":"Acetylcholine\r\nAnimals\r\nAntimanic Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\n*Bipolar Disorder\r\nCholinesterase Inhibitors/*pharmacology\r\nDepression\r\n*Disease Models, Animal\r\nDopamine\r\nDopamine Uptake Inhibitors/*pharmacology\r\nExploratory Behavior/drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nHindlimb Suspension\r\nLithium Compounds/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nPhysostigmine/*pharmacology\r\nPiperazines/*pharmacology\r\nPrepulse Inhibition/drug effects\r\nSensory Gating/drug effects\r\nSwimming","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"van Enkhuizen J, Milienne-Petiot M, Geyer MA, and Young JW (2015) Modeling bipolar disorder in mice by increasing acetylcholine or dopamine: chronic lithium treats most, but not all features..

Steps to address TRD include increasing antidepressant dose, combining antidepressants, adding adjunctive agents, or using nonpharmacological treatments. Their relative efficacy and tolerability remain inadequately tested. In particular, the value and safety of increasingly employed second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and new esketamine, compared to lithium as antidepressant adjuncts remain unclear. METHODS: We reviewed randomized, placebo-controlled trials and used random-effects meta-analysis to compare odds ratio (OR) versus placebo, as well as numbers-needed-to-treat (NNT) and to-harm (NNH), for adding SGAs, esketamine, or lithium to antidepressants for major depressive episodes. RESULTS: Analyses involved 49 drug-placebo pairs. By NNT, SGAs were more effective than placebo (NNT = 11 [CI: 9-15]); esketamine (7 [5-10]) and lithium (5 [4-10]) were even more effective. Individually, aripiprazole, olanzapine+fluoxetine, risperidone, and ziprasidone all were more effective (all NNT < 10) than quetiapine (NNT = 13), brexpiprazole (16), or cariprazine (16), with overlapping NNT CIs. Risk of adverse effects, as NNH for most-frequently reported effects, among SGAs versus placebo was 5 [4-6] overall, and highest with quetiapine (NNH = 3), lowest with brexpiprazole (19), 5 (4-6) for esketamine, and 9 (5-106) with lithium. The risk/benefit ratio (NNH/NNT) was 1.80 (1.25-10.60) for lithium and much less favorable for esketamine (0.71 [0.60-0.80]) or SGAs (0.45 [0.17-0.77]). CONCLUSIONS: Several modern antipsychotics and esketamine appeared to be useful adjuncts to antidepressants for acute major depressive episodes, but lithium was somewhat more effective and better tolerated. LIMITATIONS: Most trials of adding lithium involved older, mainly tricyclic, antidepressants, and the dosing of adjunctive treatments were not optimized.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vázquez GH ; Bahji A ; Undurraga J ; Tondo L ; Baldessarini RJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/02698811211013579 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nKetamine/administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nLithium Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nAntidepressants\r\nantipsychotics\r\ncombination\r\ndepression\r\nefficacy\r\nesketamine\r\nlithium","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vázquez GH, Bahji A, Undurraga J, Tondo L, and Baldessarini RJ (2021) Efficacy and Tolerability of Combination Treatments for Major Depression: Antidepressants plus Second-Generation Antipsychotics vs. Esketamine vs. Lithium..

In this cross-sectional neuroimaging case-control study, we tested the hypothesis that shape characteristics of deep grey matter structures in bipolar disorder are associated with the duration of lithium treatment and with clinical phenomenology. In a setting of neuropsychiatry outpatient clinic, we included 74 patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and 74 matched healthy control subjects (HC). Both groups underwent a Magnetic Resonance Imaging acquisition and an exhaustive assessment of clinical and psychiatrics dimensions. Shape measures of seven deep grey matter structures (hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, nucleus accumbens, putamen, globus pallidus and thalamus) were obtained from T1 weighted images in both groups, using FSL FIRST segmentation tool. The segmented structures were then analysed vertex-by-vertex with FSL Randomise tool. First, we investigated the presence of significant associations between the duration of lithium treatment and shape measures in BD sample. Then, for structures that resulted significantly associated with the duration of lithium treatment, comparisons between BD and HC were performed either considering the BD group as a whole or dividing it in three groups based on the duration of treatment (lithium drug-naïve, short and long treated). Any deformation uncovered by group comparisons was subsequently associated with depressive and hypomanic/manic symptoms. The relationship between structures shape and the duration of lithium treatment in BD sample was significant for bilateral nucleus accumbens. Specifically, significant bilateral extroflection effects, related to longer duration of lithium treatment, were found bilaterally over the surface shape of core accumbens nuclei (r(2)(R-Accu-Core) = 0.12, p = 0.016, r(2)(L-Accu-Core) = 0.1, p = 0.031). Moreover, introflection effect related to longer duration of treatment resulted over the shell of right accumbens (r(2)(R-Accu-Shell) = 0.17, p = 0.002). Nucleus accumbens shape did not differ between BD and HC considering BD group as a whole. By contrast, categorizing BD in subgroups as a function of the duration of lithium treatment revealed significant inward deformation on the core of left accumbens nucleus and outward deformation on the shell of the right accumbens nucleus in lithium-naive patients, compared to both patients with long duration of lithium treatment (p(L-Accu-Core) = 0.016, p(R-Accu-Shell) = 0.005) and HC (p(L-Accu-Core) = 0.002; p(R-Accu-Shell) = 0.005). Moreover, compared to HC, inward deformation on the core of the left accumbens surface was found for patients with short duration of treatment (p(LAccu-Core) = 0.027). Finally, measures of surface deformation on the core of left accumbens observed in the group comparison showed significant positive correlations with depressive symptoms severity, as assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (total score: r(2)(L-AccuCore) = 0.07, p = 0.02, somatic score: r(2)(L-Accu-Core) = 0.1, p = 0.005) and Beck Hopelessness Scale (r(2)(LAccu-Core) = 0.05, p = 0.03). Findings demonstrate that lithium untreated BD patients are characterised by localized shape abnormalities in the nucleus accumbens. Lithium treatment could act modulating these morphometric features as part of its mechanism of action in mood stabilizing.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vecchio D ; Piras F ; Piras F ; Banaj N ; Janiri D ; Simonetti A ; Sani G ; Spalletta G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.nicl.2020.102167 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy/*pathology\r\nCase-Control Studies\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nFemale\r\nGray Matter/diagnostic imaging/*drug effects/*pathology\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*pharmacology\r\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNeuroimaging/*methods\r\nNucleus Accumbens/diagnostic imaging/*drug effects/*pathology\r\nReward\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nGrey matter\r\nLithium\r\nNeuroimaging\r\nNucleus accumbens\r\nReward system\r\nShape analysis","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vecchio D, Piras F, Piras F, Banaj N, Janiri D, Simonetti A, Sani G, and Spalletta G (2020) Lithium treatment impacts nucleus accumbens shape in bipolar disorder..

METHODS: A total of 10 studies (6859 BD; 487 966 controls) were included in the meta-analysis to test whether BD is a risk factor for dementia. In addition, five studies (6483 lithium; 43 496 non-lithium) were included in the meta-analysis about the potential protective effect of lithium in BD. RESULTS: BD increases the risk of dementia (odds ratio (OR): 2.96 [95% CI: 2.09-4.18], P < 0.001), and treatment with lithium decreases the risk of dementia in BD (OR: 0.51 [95% CI: 0.36-0.72], P < 0.0001). In addition, secondary findings from our systematic review showed that the risk of progression to dementia is higher in BD than in major depressive disorder (MDD). Moreover, the number of mood episodes predicted the development of dementia in BD. CONCLUSION: Individuals with BD are at higher risk of dementia than both the general population or those with MDD. Lithium appears to reduce the risk of developing dementia in BD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Velosa J ; Delgado A ; Finger E ; Berk M ; Kapczinski F ; de Azevedo Cardoso T; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/acps.13153 ","Keywords":"Affect\r\nBipolar Disorder/*complications/*drug therapy\r\nDementia/*etiology/*prevention & control\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/complications\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nRisk Factors\r\nAlzheimer’s\r\naging\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ndementia\r\ndepression\r\nlithium\r\nmania\r\nneuroprogression\r\nprevention\r\ntreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Velosa J, Delgado A, Finger E, Berk M, Kapczinski F, and de Azevedo Cardoso T (2020) Risk of dementia in bipolar disorder and the interplay of lithium: a systematic review and meta-analyses..

In this regard, multi-target drugs raise considerable interest as promising therapeutic solutions to complex diseases. Considering the pharmacological effects of the imidazopyridine-derivative moiety imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine and the organoselenium molecules, the combination of both could be a feasible strategy to develop efficient drugs to handle obesity and related comorbidities, for example dyslipidemia and mood disorders. METHODS: The antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like properties of a selanylimidazopyridine compound, 2-Phenyl-3-(phenylselanyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (3-SePh-IP), were evaluated on high-fat/high-fructose diet (HFFD)-fed female Swiss mice. KEY FINDINGS: Our results showed that a short-term HFFD (16 days) could promote a significant body weight gain, hypercholesterolemia, glucose intolerance, and anxiety- and depressive-like behaviour in mice. Concomitant treatment with 3-SePh-IP (10 mg/kg; i.p.) attenuated the HFFD-induced increase in cholesterol levels and blunted the anxiety- and depressive-like behaviour in mice. CONCLUSIONS: 3-SePh-IP holds multimodal pharmacological properties, which provide a rationale for further studies, for example to assess the underlying mechanisms linked to its anxiolytic- and antidepressive-like activities.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Veloso IC ; Delanogare E ; Machado AE ; Braga SP ; Rosa GK ; De Bem AF ; Rafique J ; Saba S ; da Trindade RN ; Galetto FZ ; Moreira ELG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/jpp/rgaa070 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnxiety/chemically induced/*drug therapy\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nDepression/chemically induced/*drug therapy\r\nDiet, High-Fat/*adverse effects\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nFructose/*adverse effects\r\nHindlimb Suspension\r\nImidazoles/*pharmacology\r\nMice\r\nOrganoselenium Compounds/*pharmacology\r\nPyridines/*pharmacology\r\nWeight Gain/drug effects\r\nbehavioural\r\nimidazopyridine\r\nobesity\r\nselenium","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Veloso IC, Delanogare E, Machado AE, Braga SP, Rosa GK, De Bem AF, Rafique J, Saba S, da Trindade RN, Galetto FZ, and Moreira ELG (2021) A selanylimidazopyridine (3-SePh-IP) reverses the prodepressant- and anxiogenic-like effects of a high-fat/high-fructose diet in mice..

METHODS: MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched from inception to January 15th, 2019 following PRISMA and PICAR rules. International guidelines providing recommendations for the long-term treatment of BD-I were included. A methodological quality assessment was conducted with the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-AGREE II. RESULTS: The final selection yielded five international guidelines, with overall good quality. The evaluation of applicability was the weakest aspect across the guidelines. Differences in their updating strategies and the rating of the evidence, particularly for meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies, could be responsible of some level of heterogeneity among recommendations. Nonetheless, the guidelines recommended lithium as the 'gold standard' in the long-term treatment of BD-I. Quetiapine was another possible first-line option as well as aripiprazole (for the prevention of mania). Long-term treatment should contemplate monotherapy, at least initially. Clinicians should check regularly for efficacy and side effects and if necessary, switch to first-line alternatives (i.e. Valproate), combine first-line compounds with different mechanisms of action or switch to second-line options or combinations. CONCLUSIONS: The possibility to monitor improvements in long-term outcomes, namely relapse prevention and inter-episode subthreshold depressive symptoms, based on the application of their recommendations is an unmet need of clinical guidelines. In terms of evidence of clinical guidelines, there is a need for more efficacious treatment strategies for the prevention of bipolar depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Verdolini N ; Hidalgo-Mazzei D ; Del Matto L ; Muscas M ; Pacchiarotti I ; Murru A ; Samalin L ; Aedo A ; Tohen M ; Grunze H ; Young AH ; Carvalho AF ; Vieta E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/bdi.13040 ","Keywords":"Algorithms\r\n*Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nQuetiapine Fumarate/therapeutic use\r\nValproic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nbipolar disorder type I\r\nclinical guidelines\r\nlong-term treatment\r\nmaintenance\r\npractice algorithms","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Verdolini N, Hidalgo-Mazzei D, Del Matto L, Muscas M, Pacchiarotti I, Murru A, Samalin L, Aedo A, Tohen M, Grunze H, Young AH, Carvalho AF, and Vieta E (2021) Long-term treatment of bipolar disorder type I: A systematic and critical review of clinical guidelines with derived practice algorithms..

The use of treatment algorithms may optimize and enhance treatment outcome. METHODS: A single-center 3-phase treatment algorithm was evaluated for inpatients with major depressive disorder, i.e. phase I (n = 85): 7 weeks optimal antidepressant monotherapy (imipramine or venlafaxine); phase II (n = 39): 4 weeks subsequent plasma level-targeted dose lithium addition in case of insufficient improvement of antidepressant monotherapy; and phase III (n = 8): subsequent electroconvulsive therapy in case of insufficient improvement of antidepressant‑lithium treatment. Overall feasibility of the 3-phase algorithm was determined by the number of dropouts, and overall efficacy was evaluated using weekly scores on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) during the treatment phases of the algorithm. This paper is based on an RCT comparing the two antidepressants in phase I and adding lithium in phase II. RESULTS: Of the 85 patients analyzed, overall dropout during the 3-phase treatment algorithm was 24 (28%) patients. When analyzing the 3-phase treatment algorithm on a modified intention-to-treat basis, 39 (46%) patients achieved complete remission (HAM-D score ≤ 7) by the end of the algorithm. Regarding response (HAM-D score reduction ≥50%): of the 85 patients, 60 (71%) were responders by the end of the algorithm. CONCLUSION: The favorable outcome of the 3-phase treatment algorithm emphasizes the importance of pursuing stepwise antidepressant treatment in patients who are nonresponsive to the first antidepressant.

Few well-tolerated treatment options are currently available that are both effective in all phases of bipolar disorder and prevent recurrence of episodes. Lithium has well-established efficacy in the prevention of further manic episodes and may also be effective in the prevention of depression and suicide, but safety is a concern due to narrow therapeutic window. For valproate and carbamazepine, data appear much less compelling. Lamotrigine has shown to be effective for long-term prevention of depressive episodes. Controlled studies suggest that atypical antipsychotics may also have mood-stabilizing properties and might become standard for long-term therapy in the new future. The role of psychoeducation in improving adherence to medication in long-term treatment and overall patient outcomes is also crucial.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vieta E ; Rosa AR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15622970601083280 ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nLong-Term Care\r\nPatient Education as Topic\r\nPsychotherapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vieta E, and Rosa AR (2007) Evolving trends in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder..

METHODS: Patients received open-label quetiapine (400-800 mg/day; flexible, divided doses) with lithium or divalproex (target serum concentrations 0.5-1.2 mEq/L and 50-125 microg/mL, respectively) for up to 36 weeks to achieve at least 12 weeks of clinical stability. Patients were subsequently randomized to double-blind treatment with quetiapine (400-800 mg/day) plus lithium/divalproex or placebo plus lithium/divalproex for up to 104 weeks. The primary endpoint was time to recurrence of any mood event. RESULTS: Treatment with quetiapine in combination with lithium/divalproex significantly increased the time to recurrence of any mood event compared with placebo plus lithium/divalproex. The proportion of patients having a mood event was markedly lower in the quetiapine than in the placebo group (18.5% versus 49.0%). The hazard ratio for time to recurrence of a mood event was 0.28 (P<0.001), a mania event 0.30 (P<0.001), and a depression event 0.26 (P<0.001) corresponding to risk reductions of 72%, 70%, and 74%, respectively. During the randomization phase, the most common adverse events occurring in > or =5% in the quetiapine group were somnolence, nasopharyngitis, and headache. Insomnia was more common in the placebo group. During the randomization phase, there was an increase in weight of 0.5 kg in the quetiapine group and a reduction of 1.9 kg in the placebo group. The incidence and incidence density of a single emergent fasting blood glucose value> or =126 mg/dL was higher with quetiapine than with placebo (9.3% versus 4.1%; 17.6 versus 9.5 patients per 100 patient-years). LIMITATIONS: This was an enriched sample of patients with bipolar I disorder responding to treatment with quetiapine plus lithium/divalproex. CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance treatment with quetiapine in combination with lithium/divalproex significantly increased time to recurrence of any event (mania, depression, or mixed) irrespective of the polarity of the index episode compared with placebo with lithium/divalproex.

METHODS: Completers of a 6-week double-blind comparison of adjunctive aripiprazole versus placebo in bipolar mania partially responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy could enter a 46-week extension treatment with open-label adjunctive aripiprazole plus lithium (ARI + LI) or valproate (ARI + VAL). Safety, efficacy and functioning were assessed. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: CN138-134LT: Study of Aripiprazole in Patients With Bipolar I Disorder; ID number: NCT00257972; registry: www.clinicaltrials.gov. RESULTS: In total, 283 (ARI + LI n = 108; ARI + VAL n = 175) patients entered and 146 (ARI + LI n = 55; ARI + VAL n = 91) completed the 46-week, open-label extension. Frequently reported adverse events (AEs) that occurred with ARI + LI vs. ARI + VAL were: tremor (17.0% vs. 12.1%), akathisia (6.6% vs. 8.6%), headache (6.6% vs. 4.0%), insomnia (9.4% vs. 10.3%), depression (7.5% vs. 9.2%) and weight increase (11.3% vs. 8.6%). Extrapyramidal symptom-related AEs occurred in 24 (22.6%) ARI + LI- and 38 (21.8%) ARI + VAL-treated patients, with eight discontinuations. The majority of new-onset events of akathisia and insomnia occurred early. Mean (SE) weight change from double-blind endpoint to Week 46 (LOCF) was 2.3 (0.6) kg with ARI + LI and 2.0 (0.4) kg with ARI + VAL. Significant improvements from baseline over the 52 weeks (LOCF) occurred with ARI + LI and ARI + VAL on mean (95%CI) YMRS total score (-16.5 [-18.1; -14.8] and -17.6 [-18.9; -16.3], both p < 0.001 vs. baseline) and MADRS total score (-1.7 [-3.3; -0.1], p < 0.05 vs. baseline vs. -2.7 [-4.0; -1.4], p < 0.001 vs. baseline). Over the 46-week extension, continued aripiprazole provided continued YMRS improvement with ARI + LI (-2.9) and ARI + VAL (-3.3), while mean MADRS total changes were +1.1 and +1.0, respectively, and LIFE-RIFT changes were 0.2 and -0.5, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term aripiprazole adjunctive to lithium/valproate in bipolar mania was safe and well tolerated. Improvements in manic symptoms and functioning were maintained. Aripiprazole, adjunctive to either lithium or valproate, appeared to be equally safe and effective combinations for the treatment of bipolar disorder. LIMITATIONS: As an open-label extension study with a low completion rate, a conservative interpretation of the findings is warranted. Additionally, the study population was not randomly selected but chosen at the discretion of the investigator, and patients did not maintain therapeutic levels of their mood stabiliser consistently.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vieta E ; Owen R ; Baudelet C ; McQuade RD ; Sanchez R ; Marcus RN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1185/03007991003779380 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAripiprazole\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPiperazines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nQuinolones/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nValproic Acid/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vieta E, Owen R, Baudelet C, McQuade RD, Sanchez R, and Marcus RN (2010) Assessment of safety, tolerability and effectiveness of adjunctive aripiprazole to lithium/valproate in bipolar mania: a 46-week, open-label extension following a 6-week double-blind study..

It has been broadly defined in the context of unipolar major depression, but alternative definitions for bipolar depression have also been suggested. In both cases, there is a remarkable lack of consensus amongst professionals concerning its operative definition. A relatively wide variety of treatment options for unipolar TRD are available, whilst the evidence is very scanty for bipolar TRD. TRD is associated to poor clinical, functional, and social outcomes. Several novel therapeutic options are currently being investigated as promising alternatives, targeting the neurotransmitter system outside of the standard monoamine hypothesis. Augmentation or combination with lithium or atypical antipsychotics appears as a valid option for both conditions, and the same occurs with electroconvulsive therapy. Other non-pharmacological strategies such as deep brain stimulation may be promising alternatives for the future. The use of cognitive behaviour therapy is recommended for unipolar TRD, but there is no evidence supporting its use in bipolar TRD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vieta E ; Colom F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3109/07853890.2011.583675 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy/methods\r\nDeep Brain Stimulation/methods\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nDrug Delivery Systems\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy/methods\r\nHumans\r\nTreatment Failure","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vieta E, and Colom F (2011) Therapeutic options in treatment-resistant depression..

The majority of patients with bipolar disorder spend much more time in depressive episodes, including subsyndromal depressive symptoms, and bipolar depression accounts for the largest part of the morbidity and mortality of the illness. The pharmacological treatment of bipolar depression mostly consists of combinations of at least two drugs, including mood stabilizers (lithium and anticonvulsants), atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants. Antidepressants are the most frequently prescribed drugs, but recommendations from evidence-based guidelines are not conclusive and do not overtly support their use. Among antidepressants, best evidence exists for fluoxetine, but in combination with olanzapine. Although some guidelines recommend the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or bupropion in combination with antimanic agents as first-choice treatment, others do not, based on the available evidence. Among anticonvulsants, the use of lamotrigine is overall recommended as a first-line choice, but acute monotherapy studies have failed. Valproate is generally mentioned as a second-line treatment. Lithium monotherapy is also suggested by most guidelines as a first-line treatment, but its efficacy in acute use is not totally clear. Amongst atypical antipsychotics, quetiapine, in monotherapy or as adjunctive treatment, is recommended by most guidelines as a first-line choice. Olanzapine monotherapy is also suggested by some guidelines and is approved in Japan. Armodafinil, pramipexole, ketamine, and lurasidone are recent proposals. Long-term treatment in bipolar disorder is strongly recommended, but guidelines do not recommend the use of antidepressants as a maintenance treatment. Lithium, lamotrigine, valproate, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole are the recommended first-line maintenance options.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vieta E ; Valentí M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s40263-013-0073-y ","Keywords":"Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/prevention & control/psychology\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vieta E, and Valentí M (2013) Pharmacological management of bipolar depression: acute treatment, maintenance, and prophylaxis..

Since women with bipolar disorder reportedly have more features that may predict a poor prognosis (depression and rapid cycling), we tested the hypothesis that women respond less well to lithium maintenance treatment. METHODS: Clinical characteristics of 360 women and men with DSM-IV bipolar I or II disorder were compared before and during clinical lithium maintenance monotherapy in a mood disorders clinic by preliminary bivariate comparisons, multivariate analysis, and survival analysis of time stable during treatment. RESULTS: Women (n = 229) versus men (n = 131) were: more likely to have type II disorder (1.6 times), 3.2 years older at illness onset, more often depressed-before-manic (1.4 times), considered unipolar depressive 1.9 years longer and started maintenance treatment 5.5 years later. However, women differed little from men before treatment in overall morbidity, average episode frequency and risk of suicide attempts. Contrary to prediction, women showed non-significantly superior responses to lithium treatment, and a significant 60% longer median time before a first recurrence during treatment, despite 7% lower average serum lithium concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Women were diagnosed as bipolar later than men with corresponding delay of lithium maintenance treatment that proved to be at least as effective as in men.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Viguera AC ; Baldessarini RJ ; Tondo L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1034/j.1399-5618.2001.30503.x ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nChild\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nProspective Studies\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSex Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Viguera AC, Baldessarini RJ, and Tondo L (2001) Response to lithium maintenance treatment in bipolar disorders: comparison of women and men..

There are several definitions and staging models of TRD and a consensus for each has not yet been established. However, in common for each model is the inadequate response to at least 2 trials of antidepressant pharmacotherapy. In this review, a comprehensive analysis of existing literature regarding the challenges and management of TRD has been compiled. A PubMed search was performed to assemble meta-analyses, trials and reviews on the topic of TRD. First, we address the confounds in the definitions and staging models of TRD, and subsequently the difficulties inherent in assessing the illness. Pharmacological augmentation strategies including lithium, triiodothyronine and second-generation antipsychotics are reviewed, as is switching of antidepressant class. Somatic therapies, including several modalities of brain stimulation (electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy and deep brain stimulation) are detailed, psychotherapeutic strategies and subsequently novel therapeutics including ketamine, psilocybin, anti-inflammatories and new directions are reviewed in this manuscript.

It is recommended by all relevant guidelines as a first-line treatment for maintenance therapy. In this review, we outline the current state of evidence for lithium in the treatment of BD over the lifespan. First, we summarize the evidence on efficacy in general, from relapse prevention to acute anti-manic treatment and its role in treating mood episodes with mixed features and bipolar depression. As patients are often treated for many years and different aspects have to be considered in different phases of life, we discuss the particularities of lithium in the treatment of paediatric BD, in older aged individuals and in pregnant women. Lastly, we discuss the evidence on lithium's proposed suicide-preventive effects, the dangers of rapid discontinuation and lithium's adverse effects, particularly with regard to long-term treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Volkmann C ; Bschor T ; Köhler S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00377 ","Keywords":"bipolar disorder\r\ndiscontinuation\r\nefficacy\r\nlifespan\r\nlithium\r\nsuicidality","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Volkmann C, Bschor T, and Köhler S (2020) Lithium Treatment Over the Lifespan in Bipolar Disorders..

Deficient synaptic plasticity is considered one important mechanism of this disease. Lithium inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3β), which is involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. In animal preparations, inhibition of GSK-3β by lithium up-regulated long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses but down-regulated long-term depression (LTD). The effects of lithium on plasticity in the human brain are unexplored. We tested the effects of a single oral dose of 900 mg of lithium on LTP-/LTD-like plasticity in human motor cortex induced by established paired associative transcranial magnetic stimulation (PAS(LTP), PAS(LTD)) protocols. We studied 10 healthy adults in a placebo-controlled double-blind randomized crossover design. PAS-induced plasticity was indexed by change in motor evoked potential amplitude recorded in a hand muscle. In the placebo session, subjects were stratified, according to the known variability of the PAS(LTP) response, into PAS(LTP) 'LTP responders' and PAS(LTP) 'LTD responders' (n = 5 each). Lithium did not affect the PAS(LTP)-induced LTP-like plasticity in the 'LTP responders', but switched the PAS(LTP)-induced LTD-like plasticity in the 'LTD responders' to LTP-like plasticity. In contrast, lithium had no effect on the PAS(LTD)-induced LTD-like plasticity in the 'LTD responders'. We provide first-time evidence that lithium significantly modulates brain stimulation induced plasticity in human cortex. The switch from LTD- to LTP-like plasticity is best explained by the inhibitory action of lithium on GSK-3β. This conclusion is necessarily circumstantial because GSK-3β activity was not directly measured. We discuss that other important plasticity-related modes actions of lithium cannot explain our findings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Voytovych H ; Kriváneková L ; Ziemann U ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuropharm.2012.03.023 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nEvoked Potentials, Motor/*drug effects/physiology\r\nFemale\r\nHand/physiology\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*pharmacology\r\nLong-Term Potentiation/*drug effects/physiology\r\nLong-Term Synaptic Depression/*drug effects/physiology\r\nMale\r\nMotor Cortex/*drug effects/physiology\r\nMovement/physiology\r\n*Neuronal Plasticity\r\nTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Voytovych H, Kriváneková L, and Ziemann U (2012) Lithium: a switch from LTD- to LTP-like plasticity in human cortex..

Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) have been implicated in its putative mechanisms of action. These proteins are integral components of the insulin signaling pathway, which may serve as a critical co-regulator of drug action. Utilizing an animal model of tricyclic antidepressant resistance, we investigated the relationship between insulin signaling and antidepressant response to lithium augmentation. Pre-treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH 100 µg/day i.p.) for 14 days effectively blocked the immobility-reducing effects of an acute dose of imipramine (10 mg/kg i.p.) in the forced swim test (FST). Lithium augmentation (100 mg/kg i.p.) rescued the antidepressant-like effects of imipramine in this model. Total and phosphorylated (p) levels of protein kinase B (Akt), mTOR, and GSK3β protein were quantified in the infralimbic cortex (ILPFC) following FST stress via Western blot. Levels of mTOR and pmTOR were further quantified in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) following insulin stimulation (10 mg/mL for 5 min) via ELISA. Elevated levels of phosphorylated insulin signaling proteins were present in the ILPFC of ACTH-pretreated animals that received both imipramine and lithium, together with a concurrent increase in mTOR activation in PBMCs. Large correlations were observed between immobility time and insulin-stimulated mTOR levels in PBMCs. We propose that PBMC insulin challenge may be a useful probe for predicting antidepressant response to lithium administration, and potentially other therapies acting via similar mechanisms of action.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Walker AJ ; Price JB ; Borreggine K ; Sutor SL ; Gogos A ; McGillivray JA ; Frye MA ; Tye SJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41398-019-0434-5 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/*pharmacology\r\nDepression/drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nImipramine/*pharmacology\r\nInsulin/pharmacology\r\nLeukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*metabolism\r\nLithium/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nPhosphorylation\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSignal Transduction/drug effects\r\nSwimming\r\nTOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Walker AJ, Price JB, Borreggine K, Sutor SL, Gogos A, McGillivray JA, Frye MA, and Tye SJ (2019) Insulin-stimulated mTOR activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells associated with early treatment response to lithium augmentation in rodent model of antidepressant-resistance..

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether LiCl as well as CBZ has similar effects on the bipolar disorder-associated cognitive dysfunctions in rats, particularly the spatial learning and depressive responses. Adult male Wistar rats were administered intracerebroventricularly with 5μl of 10(-3)M ouabain on session 1, and then received an intraperitoneal injection of LiCl or CBZ for 4 sessions (1 session/2days). For the behavioral tests, all rats were subjected to the water maze 15min for spatial learning and the forced swimming test 5min for depression on each session. The present results showed that ouabain resulted in increased latency and longer distance traveled to reach the hidden platform in the water maze, indicating that ouabain impaired the spatial learning. However, ouabain did not affect swimming velocity in the water maze and depressive responses in the forced swimming test. LiCl treatment decreased the ouabain-enhanced latency and the total distance, but not the velocity, swam to reach the hidden platform in the water maze task. Additionally, LiCl did not result in changes of any depressive indices, such as struggling behavior, swimming behavior, and floating behavior. Likewise, CBZ did not affect any behavioral indices of spatial learning and depression. A linear regression analysis suggested that LiCl, but not CBZ, could predict the decreased latency and total distance traveled except the velocity of swimming in the water maze and depressive behaviors. In summary, the present results suggested that lithium provided a better therapeutic effect than CBZ for ouabain-caused dysfunctions of spatial learning in a rat model of bipolar disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wang YC ; Wang EN ; Wang CC ; Huang CL ; Huang AC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pbb.2013.02.004 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBipolar Disorder/*chemically induced/metabolism\r\nCarbamazepine/*pharmacology\r\nDepression/*metabolism\r\n*Disease Models, Animal\r\nLearning/*drug effects\r\nLithium/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nOuabain/*toxicity\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wang YC, Wang EN, Wang CC, Huang CL, and Huang AC (2013) Effects of lithium and carbamazepine on spatial learning and depressive behavior in a rat model of bipolar disorder induced by ouabain..

Developments over the past 9 years suggest that another update is needed. METHODS: The 2010 algorithm and associated references were reevaluated. A literature search was conducted on PubMed for recent studies and review articles to see what changes in the recommendations were justified. Exceptions to the main algorithm for special patient populations, including those with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, and women of childbearing potential, and those with common medical comorbidities were considered. RESULTS: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is still the first-line option for patients in need of urgent treatment. Five medications are recommended for early usage in acute bipolar depression, singly or in combinations when monotherapy fails, the order to be determined by considerations such as side effect vulnerability and patient preference. The five are lamotrigine, lurasidone, lithium, quetiapine, and cariprazine. After trials of these, possible options include antidepressants (bupropion and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are preferred) or valproate (very small evidence-base). In bipolar II depression, the support for antidepressants is a little stronger but depression with mixed features and rapid cycling would usually lead to further postponement of antidepressants. Olanzapine+fluoxetine, though Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for bipolar depression, is not considered until beyond this point, due to metabolic side effects. The algorithm concludes with a table of other possible treatments that have some evidence. CONCLUSIONS: This revision incorporates the latest FDA-approved treatments (lurasidone and cariprazine) and important new studies and organizes the evidence systematically.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wang D ; Osser DN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/bdi.12860 ","Keywords":"Algorithms\r\n*Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\n*Psychopharmacology\r\nQuetiapine Fumarate/therapeutic use\r\nalgorithms\r\nbipolar depression\r\ncariprazine\r\nlurasidone\r\npsychopharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wang D, and Osser DN (2020) The Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project at the Harvard South Shore Program: An update on bipolar depression..

Avoiding a switch is an important part of any therapeutic plan, whether a patient suffers from unipolar or bipolar depression. One method of avoiding switching is use of a mood stabilizer, such as lithium carbonate. DESIGN: The research team performed a narrative review by searching Chinese electronic databases: the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WANFANG, and the Chinese Social Sciences Citation Index (VIP). The search used the keywords depression-bipolar depression and depressive episode-and lithium carbonate. Results such as comments, letters, reviews, and case reports were excluded. SETTING: The study took place at Jinhua Second Hospital, China. RESULTS: A random effect model was used to account for the data, using Revman 5.2. The switch rate for the intervention groups was 8.28% or 29 out of 351 participants and of the control groups was 25.29% or 87 out of 344 participants (OR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.39). Lithium carbonate reduced the switch rate by 67.25% [(25.29%-8.28%) /25.29%]. In the bipolar depression group, lithium carbonate reduced the switch rate by 68.11% [(25.84%-8.24%) /25.84%]. In the depression and unipolar depression groups, lithium carbonate reduced the switch rate by 67.07% [(25.29%-8.26%) /25.29%]. In the group of patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), lithium reduced the switch rate by 60.3% [(29.85%-11.85%) /29.85%]. In group of patients treated by tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), lithium carbonate reduced the switch rate by 73.14% [(22.28%-6.01%) /22.28%]. CONCLUSIONS: As typical mood stabilizer, lithium carbonate can reduce the antidepressant-induced switch rates in patients with depressive episodes regardless of the type of antidepressant and the type of depressive episode. Further research should compare the effectiveness of lithium carbonate to that of other mood stabilizers in preventing switching associated with antidepressants.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wangqiang L ; Hejian T ; Fengli S ; Weidong J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nData Analysis\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\n*Lithium Carbonate/therapeutic use\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wangqiang L, Hejian T, Fengli S, and Weidong J (2022) Preventive Effects of Lithium Carbonate on Antidepressant-Induced Switch During Depressive Episodes: Chinese Data Analysis..

SUICIDAL CRISIS: Acute intervention should start immediately in order to keep the patient alive. DIAGNOSIS: An underlying psychiatric disorder is present in up to 90% of people who completed suicide. Comorbidity with depression, anxiety, substance abuse and personality disorders is high. In order to achieve successful prevention of suicidality, adequate diagnostic procedures and appropriate treatment for the underlying disorder are essential. TREATMENT: Existing evidence supports the efficacy of pharmacological treatment and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in preventing suicidal behaviour. Some other psychological treatments are promising, but the supporting evidence is currently insufficient. Studies show that antidepressant treatment decreases the risk for suicidality among depressed patients. However, the risk of suicidal behaviour in depressed patients treated with antidepressants exists during the first 10-14 days of treatment, which requires careful monitoring. Short-term supplementary medication with anxiolytics and hypnotics in the case of anxiety and insomnia is recommended. Treatment with antidepressants of children and adolescents should only be given under supervision of a specialist. Long-term treatment with lithium has been shown to be effective in preventing both suicide and attempted suicide in patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. Treatment with clozapine is effective in reducing suicidal behaviour in patients with schizophrenia. Other atypical antipsychotics are promising but more evidence is required. TREATMENT TEAM: Multidisciplinary treatment teams including psychiatrist and other professionals such as psychologist, social worker, and occupational therapist are always preferable, as integration of pharmacological, psychological and social rehabilitation is recommended especially for patients with chronic suicidality. FAMILY: The suicidal person independently of age should always be motivated to involve family in the treatment. SOCIAL SUPPORT: Psychosocial treatment and support is recommended, as the majority of suicidal patients have problems with relationships, work, school and lack functioning social networks. SAFETY: A secure home, public and hospital environment, without access to suicidal means is a necessary strategy in suicide prevention. Each treatment option, prescription of medication and discharge of the patient from hospital should be carefully evaluated against the involved risks. TRAINING OF PERSONNEL: Training of general practitioners (GPs) is effective in the prevention of suicide. It improves treatment of depression and anxiety, quality of the provided care and attitudes towards suicide. Continuous training including discussions about ethical and legal issues is necessary for psychiatrists and other mental health professionals.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wasserman D ; Rihmer Z ; Rujescu D ; Sarchiapone M ; Sokolowski M ; Titelman D ; Zalsman G ; Zemishlany Z ; Carli V ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.eurpsy.2011.06.003 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nSchizophrenia/*drug therapy\r\nSuicidal Ideation\r\nSuicide/psychology\r\n*Suicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wasserman D, Rihmer Z, Rujescu D, Sarchiapone M, Sokolowski M, Titelman D, Zalsman G, Zemishlany Z, and Carli V (2012) The European Psychiatric Association (EPA) guidance on suicide treatment and prevention..

Without treatment, there is substantial risk for morbidity and mortality, making BD a considerable public health problem. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the relative effectiveness and tolerability of Acanthopanax senficosus (A senficosus)-an herb that is derived from eleutherosides and polysaccharides found in the plant's root- versus fluoxetine added to lithium in the treatment of BD in adolescents. METHODS: This was a double-blind, 6-week study. The patients were randomized into 2 treatment groups-A senticosus plus lithium (A senticosus group) and fluoxetine plus lithium (fluoxetine group). The patients underwent a baseline assessment using the 17-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) during the screening period. Patients were scheduled for clinical visits at the end of weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6. At the end of the 6-week treatment period, each patient's condition was rated as follows: response (indicating an improvement of ≥50% in the HAMD-17 score from baseline); remission (a HAMD-17 score of ⪯7); and switching to mania (a YMRS score >16, and meeting the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Fourth Edition, Text Revision] for a manic episode). At each visit (with the exception of the enrollment visit), the patients were queried as to whether they experienced any health problems since the previous visit, a Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale assessment was completed, and the serum lithium concentration was analyzed. The patients were instructed to report adverse events (AEs) at any time during the study. AEs were also observed by the investigator(s) at clinical visits. RESULTS: Seventy-nine Chinese adolescents were initially enrolled into the study. However, 76 adolescents were assessed for inclusion (45 females, 31 males; mean [SD] age, 15.4 [30.0] years; age range, 12-17 years) in the study. All included patients completed the study. After 6 weeks of treatment, the response rate between the A senticosus and the fluoxetine groups was similar (67.6% vs 71.8%, respectively). The remission rate between both groups was also similar (51.4% vs 48.7%). Analyzed by a general line model, the HAMD-17 scores revealed there was a significant time effect (F = 183.06; P < 0.01), but not a significant group effect (F = 0.99) or group-by-duration of treatment interaction (F = 0.779). Three patients in the fluoxetine group experienced switching to mania compared with no patient in the A senticosus group. AEs reported by patients in the A senticosus group were as follows: nausea, 2 (5.4%); rash, 1 (2.7%); and diarrhea, 1 (2.7%). AEs reported by patients in the fluoxetine group were as follows: nausea, 4 (10.3%); anxiety, 3 (7.7%); insomnia, 3 (7.7%); constipation, 1 (2.6%); and tinnitus, 1 (2.6%). CONCLUSION: Our study found no significant difference in these adolescents with BD treated with lithium plus adjunctive A senticosus or fluoxetine. All treatments were generally well tolerated.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Weng S ; Tang J ; Wang G ; Wang X ; Wang H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.curtheres.2007.08.004 ","Keywords":"Acanthopanax senticosus\r\nadolescent\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nfluoxetine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Weng S, Tang J, Wang G, Wang X, and Wang H (2007) Comparison of the Addition of Siberian Ginseng (Acanthopanax senticosus) Versus Fluoxetine to Lithium for the Treatment of Bipolar Disorder in Adolescents: A Randomized, Double-Blind Trial..

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of psychopharmacologic and somatic therapies on suicide risk. METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE for studies evaluating the effects of pharmacologic (excluding antidepressants) or somatic interventions on suicide risk was conducted. Studies were included if they used a comparison group, reported on suicide death, assessed a psychopharmacological or somatic intervention, and included adults. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Fifty-seven studies were included from 2940 reviewed citations. RESULTS: In bipolar disorder, lithium was associated with a reduction in the odds of suicide compared to active controls (odds ratio [OR] = .58, p = .005; k = 12) and compared to placebo/no lithium (OR = .46, p = .009; k = 9). In mixed diagnostic samples, lithium was associated with a reduction in the odds of suicide compared to placebo/no lithium (OR = .27, p < .001; k = 12), but not compared to active controls (OR = .89, p = .468; k = 7). In psychotic disorders, clozapine was associated with a reduction in the odds of suicide (OR = .46, p = .007; k = 7). Associations between suicide death and electroconvulsive therapy (OR = .77, p = .053; k = 11), non-clozapine antipsychotics in bipolar disorder (OR = .73, p = .090; k = 6) and antipsychotics in psychotic disorders (OR = .39, p = .069; k = 6) were not significant. There was no consistent relationship between antiepileptic mood stabilizers and suicide. There were insufficient studies to meta-analyze associations of suicide risk with vagus nerve stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy, or transcranial direct current stimulation. CONCLUSION: Lithium and clozapine have consistent data supporting protective effects against suicide in certain clinical contexts.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wilkinson ST ; Trujillo Diaz D; Rupp ZW ; Kidambi A ; Ramirez KL ; Flores JM ; Avila-Quintero VJ ; Rhee TG ; Olfson M ; Bloch MH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/da.23222 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use\r\n*Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation\r\n*Suicide Prevention\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ndepression\r\nsuicide/self harm\r\ntreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wilkinson ST, Trujillo Diaz D, Rupp ZW, Kidambi A, Ramirez KL, Flores JM, Avila-Quintero VJ, Rhee TG, Olfson M, and Bloch MH (2022) Pharmacological and somatic treatment effects on suicide in adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis..

Suicide risk factors include a previous suicide attempt and psychiatric disorders. The highest mortality rate in suicide worldwide is due to depression. Current evidence suggests that suicide etiopathogenesis is associated with neuroinflammation that activates the kynurenine pathway and causes subsequent serotonin depletion and stimulation of glutamate neurotransmission. These changes are accompanied by decreased BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) levels in the brain, which is often linked to impaired neuroplasticity and cognitive deficits. Most suicidal patients have a hyperactive hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Epigenetic mechanisms control the above-mentioned neurobiological changes associated with suicidal behaviour. Suicide risk could be attenuated by appropriate psychological treatment, electroconvulsive treatment, and drugs: lithium, ketamine, esketamine, clozapine. In this review, we present the etiopathogenesis of suicide behaviour and explore the mechanisms of action of anti-suicidal treatments, pinpointing similarities among them.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wisłowska-Stanek A ; Kołosowska K ; Maciejak P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/cells10102519 ","Keywords":"Behavior/physiology\r\nHumans\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*metabolism\r\nNeuroinflammatory Diseases/*metabolism/psychology\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System/*metabolism\r\nRisk Factors\r\n*Suicidal Ideation\r\nBDNF\r\nclozapine\r\ncortisol\r\nepigenetics\r\nesketamine\r\nketamine\r\nkynurenine pathway\r\nlithium\r\nserotonin\r\nsuicide","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wisłowska-Stanek A, Kołosowska K, and Maciejak P (2021) Neurobiological Basis of Increased Risk for Suicidal Behaviour..

In the context of bipolar disorders dysfunctional cognitive structures have received little interest as these patients seem to be less disturbed during the euthymic interval than patients with major depression. METHODS: In the present study, the self-esteem of remitted patients with DSM-III-R diagnosis of major depression (n=20), bipolar disorder (n=20) and healthy controls (n=20) was measured with the Frankfurt Self-concept Scale (FSKN). RESULTS: 1) Statistical analysis by analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed no significant differences as to age, sex, etc. between the psychiatric groups. The clinical groups showed lower self-esteem ratings in comparison to healthy controls. 2) Four groups (T1-T4) of remitted patients with bipolar disorders (20 in each group) were successfully maintained on mood stabilizers (lithium or carbamazepine) and classified by the duration of their episode-free period. T1 included those who were episode-free for only the week before discharge from hospital. T2 were symptom-free for <30 months. T3 were episode-free for >30 months and <60 months. T4 were episode-free for >60 months. The comparison of their FSKN self-esteem ratings by ANOVA suggests that self-esteem improves during successful prophylactic treatment. A posteriori contrasts indicate a normalized self-esteem after a bipolar episode-free period of at least 47 months. CONCLUSIONS: Dysfunctional cognitions can be demonstrated in unipolar as well as in bipolar patients. Successful episode-preventive medication with mood stabilizers seems to counteract lowered self-esteem. Adjunctive cognitive therapy might help to optimize the long-term course of bipolar disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wolf T ; Müller-Oerlinghausen B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1034/j.1399-5618.2002.00136.x ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*complications/diagnosis/*prevention & control\r\nCarbamazepine/*therapeutic use\r\nCognition Disorders/*etiology\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/complications/diagnosis\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nRemission Induction\r\nSelf Concept","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wolf T, and Müller-Oerlinghausen B (2002) The influence of successful prophylactic drug treatment on cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorders..

DSM-IV criteria for BP II require the presence or history of one or more major depressive episode, plus at least one hypomanic episode, which, by definition, must last for at least 4 days. Various studies found distinct patterns of symptoms and familial inheritance for BP II disorder. BP II is commonly underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. Making an early and accurate diagnosis of BP II is utmost importance in the management of BP II disorder. The clinician should have this diagnosis in mind when he is facing a patient presenting with mood problems, particularly unipolar depression. Quetiapine and lamotrigine are the only agents with demonstrated efficacy in double-blind RCT. Although the evidence for the use of lithium in long-term therapy is largely based on observational studies, the many years of close follow-up, comparatively larger subject numbers, and 'harder' clinically meaningful with bipolar disorder outcomes measures, enhance our confidence in its role in treating BP II. With respect to short-term treatment, there is some limited support for the use of risperidone and olanzepine in hypomania and for fluoxetine, venlafaxine and valproate in treating depression. The current clinical debate over whether one should use antidepressants as monotherapy or in combination with a mood stabilizer when treating BP II depression is not yet settled. There is a need for large, well-designed RCTs to cast more definitive light on how best to manage patients with BP II disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wong MM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4103/0253-7176.85391 ","Keywords":"Bipolar\r\nantidepressants\r\ndepression\r\ndisorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wong MM (2011) Management of Bipolar II Disorder..

Treatment began either before or after the onset of symptoms. Chronic treatment with lithium caused a significant improvement in rotarod performance when treatment was started post- but not pre-symptomatically. There was no overall effect on survival in either group, but further analysis revealed that in the post-symptomatic group, mice could be assigned to one of two distinct groups, depending on the effects of lithium. One subgroup of mice lost weight faster, died earlier and showed rotarod performance similar to the vehicle-treated controls. The other subgroup lost weight at a normal rate, died at a similar age, but showed greatly improved motor performance compared to controls. The improvement in rotarod performance suggests that lithium may improve motor symptoms as well as depression in some HD patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wood NI ; Morton AJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0361-9230(03)00141-2 ","Keywords":"Aging/drug effects\r\nAnimals\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nBody Weight/drug effects\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDrug Administration Routes/veterinary\r\nFemale\r\nHuntington Disease/*drug therapy/mortality/physiopathology\r\nLithium Chloride/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nMice, Transgenic\r\nMotor Activity/*drug effects\r\nMutation\r\nNorbornanes\r\nPhenotype\r\nPsychomotor Performance/drug effects\r\nRotation\r\nSurvival\r\nTime Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wood NI, and Morton AJ (2003) Chronic lithium chloride treatment has variable effects on motor behaviour and survival of mice transgenic for the Huntington's disease mutation..

This stress-induced neuronal remodeling is accompanied also by behavioral changes, some of which can be prevented with selective antidepressant and anticonvulsive drug treatments. Lithium is an effective treatment for mood disorders and has neuroprotective effects, which may contribute to its therapeutic properties. Thus, we wanted to determine whether lithium treatment could prevent the effects of chronic stress on CA3 pyramidal cell neuroarchitecture and the associated molecular and behavioral measures. Chronic lithium treatment prevented the stress-induced decrease in dendritic length, as well as the stress-induced increase in glial glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) mRNA expression and the phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding in the hippocampus. Lithium treatment, however, did not prevent stress effects on behavior in the open field or the plus-maze. These data demonstrate that chronic treatment with lithium can protect the hippocampus from potentially deleterious effects of chronic stress on glutamatergic activation, which may be relevant to its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wood GE ; Young LT ; Reagan LP ; Chen B ; McEwen BS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0400208101 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects/physiology\r\nBody Weight/drug effects/physiology\r\nExcitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2/biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics\r\nHippocampus/*metabolism\r\nLithium/blood/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nNeurons/drug effects/metabolism\r\nNeuropeptides/blood\r\nRats\r\nStress, Physiological/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nTranquilizing Agents/*pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wood GE, Young LT, Reagan LP, Chen B, and McEwen BS (2004) Stress-induced structural remodeling in hippocampus: prevention by lithium treatment..

We decided to investigate whether a combination of agents with antidepressant activity (i.e., imipramine, ketamine, and Zn(2+)) may influence/reverse the depressogenic effect of dexamethasone therapy. The antidepressant-like effect was assessed by the forced swim test in adult mice. The inhibitory activity of dexamethasone was dose-dependent: only the highest tested dose of the glucocorticoid (i.e., 64 μg/kg) given as a single injection increased immobility time, whereas 16 μg/kg/day of dexamethasone administered repeatedly (for 14 days) induced a significant alteration in animal behavior. Both the acute or sub-chronic administration of the active doses of imipramine (10 mg/kg), Zn(2+) (30 mg/kg), and ketamine (30 mg/kg), and the combinations of their per se inactive doses reversed the inhibitory activity of dexamethasone (16 μg/kg/day) administered for 14 consecutive days. Whereas a single injection of an inhibitory dose of dexamethasone (64 μg/kg) was not able to abolish the antidepressant effect of imipramine (5 mg/kg), Zn(2+) (10 mg/kg), and imipramine-Zn(2+) combination (2.5 and 5 mg/kg, respectively) given once a day for 14 consecutive days. Our findings indicate that the chronic dexamethasone injection procedure has some potential as an animal model of depression and they further support the theory of interplay between glutamatergic neurotransmission and the chronic or excessive exposition to glucocorticoids.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wróbel A ; Serefko A ; Wlaź P ; Poleszak E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11011-015-9709-6 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*chemically induced/*drug therapy/psychology\r\n*Dexamethasone\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nExcitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/*therapeutic use\r\nImipramine/*therapeutic use\r\nKetamine/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nSwimming/psychology\r\nSynaptic Transmission/drug effects\r\nZinc/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressant-like activity\r\nDexamethasone\r\nForced swim test\r\nMice","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wróbel A, Serefko A, Wlaź P, and Poleszak E (2015) The effect of imipramine, ketamine, and zinc in the mouse model of depression..

With the industrialization of nanostructured materials and increasing public exposure, the biosafety and potential influences on central nervous system (CNS) have received more attention. Nanosized zinc oxide (nanoZnO) was suggested to up-regulate neuronal excitability and to induce glutamate release in vitro. Therefore, we hypothesized nanoparticles of nanoZnO may lead to changes in balance of neurotransmitter or neuronal excitability of CNS. This study was to investigate if there were effects of nanoZnO on animal model of depression. METHODS: Male Swiss mice were given lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 100 μg/kg, 100 μg/ml, every other day, 8 times, i.p.) from weaning to induce depressive-like behaviors. NanoZnO (5.6 mg/kg, 5.6 mg/ml, every other day, 8 times, i.p.) was given as the interaction. The mouse model was characterized using the methods of open field test, tail suspension test and forced swim test. Furthermore, the spatial memory was evaluated using Morris water maze (MWM) and the synaptic plasticity was assessed by measuring the long-term potentiation (LTP) in the perforant pathway (PP) to dentate gyrus (DG) in vivo. RESULTS: Results indicated that model mice showed disrupted spatial memory and LTP after LPS injections and the behavioral and electrophysiological improvements after nanoZnO treatment. CONCLUSION: Data suggested that nanoZnO may play some roles in CNS of mental disorders, which could provide some useful direction on the new drug exploring and clinical researches.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Xie Y ; Wang Y ; Zhang T ; Ren G ; Yang Z ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1423-0127-19-14 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nCognition/*drug effects\r\nDentate Gyrus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nDepression/chemically induced/*physiopathology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nInjections, Intraperitoneal\r\nLipopolysaccharides/toxicity\r\nLong-Term Potentiation/*drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMaze Learning/drug effects\r\nMemory, Short-Term/drug effects\r\nMice\r\nNanoparticles/administration & dosage/*adverse effects\r\nPerforant Pathway/drug effects/metabolism\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nSpatial Behavior/drug effects\r\nSynaptic Transmission/*drug effects\r\nZinc Oxide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/chemistry","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Xie Y, Wang Y, Zhang T, Ren G, and Yang Z (2012) Effects of nanoparticle zinc oxide on spatial cognition and synaptic plasticity in mice with depressive-like behaviors..

This umbrella review aimed to summarize comprehensively the current evidence reporting the effects of dietary factors on the prevention and treatment of depression. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched up to June 2021 to identify relevant meta-analyses of prospective studies. Twenty-eight meta-analyses, with 40 summary estimates on dietary patterns (n = 8), food and beverages (n = 19), and nutrients (n = 13) were eligible. The methodological quality of most meta-analyses was low (50.0%) or very low (25.0%). Quality of evidence was moderate for inverse associations for depression incidence with healthy diet [risk ratio (RR): 0.74, 95% confidential interval (CI), 0.48-0.99, I(2) = 89.8%], fish (RR: 0.88, 95% CI, 0.79-0.97, I(2 )= 0.0%), coffee (RR: 0.89, 95% CI, 0.84-0.94, I(2 )= 32.9%), dietary zinc (RR: 0.66, 95% CI 0.50-0.82, I(2 )= 13.9%), light to moderate alcohol (<40 g/day, RR: 0.77, 95% CI, 0.74-0.83, I(2 )= 20.5%), as well as for positive association with sugar-sweetened beverages (RR: 1.05, 95% CI, 1.01-1.09, I(2 )= 0.0%). For depression treatment, moderate-quality evidence was identified for the effects of probiotic [standardized mean difference (SMD): -0.31, 95% CI, -0.56 to -0.07, I(2 )= 48.2%], omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (SMD: -0.28, 95% CI, -0.47 to -0.09, I(2) = 75.0%) and acetyl-L-carnitine (SMD: -1.10, 95% CI, -1.65 to -0.56, I(2) = 86.0%) supplementations. Overall, the associations between dietary factors and depression had been extensively evaluated, but none of them were rated as high quality of evidence, suggesting further studies are likely to change the summary estimates.

We investigated whether depression and suicidal symptoms in the chronic phase are related to remote future clinical outcomes in patients with schizophrenia and whether psychotropics improved clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The subjects included 462 outpatients of working age (15 to 64 years old) with schizophrenia treated at Okayama University Hospital from January 2010 to December 2011. We investigated the relationship between the Clinical Global Impression-Severity score at the last visit (average 19.2 years) and the existence of previous depression, suicidal ideas, and suicide attempts. We adjusted by several possible confounders including medical history using multiple regression analysis or logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 462 patients, 168 (36.4%) presented with depression 2 years after schizophrenia onset. A history of suicidal ideas and attempts was related to worse clinical outcome. In males, a history of depression was related to worse clinical outcome, but not in females. Lithium carbonate was related to better clinical outcome in all schizophrenia patients with depression, especially in males. Treatment with antidepressants was related to better clinical outcome only in males.

The development of depression is correlated with neuronal atrophy, insufficient secretion of monoamine neurotransmitters, extreme deviations from the normal microglial activation status, and immune-inflammatory response. Studies found that Se supplementation was related to the improvement of depression. In this study, we applied selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) for F-induced depression disease mitigation by regulating the histopathology, metabolic index, genes, and protein expression related to the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway in vivo. Results showed that F and 2 mg Se/kg BW/day SeNPs lowered the dopamine (DA) content (P < 0.05), altered the microglial morphology, ramification index as well as solidity, and triggered the microglial neuroinflammatory response by increasing the p-STAT3 nuclear translocation (P < 0.01). Furthermore, F reduced the cortical Se content and the number of surviving neurons (P < 0.05), increasing the protein expressions of p-JAK2/JAK2 and p-STAT3/STAT3 of the cortex (P < 0.01), accompanied by the depression-like behavior. Importantly, 1 mg Se/kg BW/day SeNPs alleviated the microglial ramification index as well as solidity changes and decreased the interleukin-1β secretion induced by F by suppressing the p-STAT3 nuclear translocation (P < 0.01). Likewise, 1 mg Se/kg BW/day SeNPs restored the F-disturbed dopamine and noradrenaline secretion, increased the number of cortical surviving neurons, and reduced the vacuolation area, ultimately suppressing the occurrence of depression-like behavior through inhibiting the JAK2-STAT3 pathway activation. In conclusion, 1 mg Se/kg BW/day SeNPs have mitigation effects on the F-induced depression-like behavior. The mechanism of how SeNPs repair neural functions will benefit depression mitigation. This study also indicates that inhibiting the JAK/STAT pathway can be a promising novel treatment for depressive disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yang J ; Li H ; Hao Z ; Jing X ; Zhao Y ; Cheng X ; Ma H ; Wang J ; Wang J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1021/acsami.1c18417 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBiocompatible Materials/chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nDepression/chemically induced/*drug therapy\r\nFluorides\r\nMale\r\nMaterials Testing\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred Strains\r\nMicroglia/*drug effects\r\nNanoparticles/*chemistry\r\nSelenium/chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nJAK2-STAT3 pathway\r\ndepression-like behavior\r\ndopamine\r\nfluoride\r\nmicroglia\r\nselenium nanoparticles","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yang J, Li H, Hao Z, Jing X, Zhao Y, Cheng X, Ma H, Wang J, and Wang J (2022) Mitigation Effects of Selenium Nanoparticles on Depression-Like Behavior Induced by Fluoride in Mice via the JAK2-STAT3 Pathway..

The aetiology of depression is partly unclear; however, intake of nutrients, such as magnesium, have been suggested to affect depressive symptoms and modify depression risk. METHODS: This research is a part of the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, conducted on a sample of 2320 Eastern Finnish men aged 42-61 years old at the baseline. Magnesium intake was assessed by a 4-day food record. Hospital discharge diagnosis of unipolar depressive disorder was used as an outcome variable. RESULTS: Participants in the middle tertile of dietary magnesium intake had a statistically significantly decreased risk of getting a hospital discharge diagnosis of depression compared to participants in the lowest tertile of magnesium intake (HR 0.49, CI 0.25-0.95, P=0.035) in the prospective setting after multivariable adjustments. In addition, an inverse association between magnesium intake and the risk of depression was found when the combined middle and highest tertiles of magnesium intake were compared with the lowest tertile (HR 0.53, CI 0.29-0.95, P=0.033). LIMITATIONS: Our findings may not be generalizable to individuals below middle-age or women. Moreover, we were unable to consider cases with mild depression in the longitudinal setting. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that magnesium intake may have an effect on the risk to develop depression. Further studies are needed to investigate whether sufficient magnesium intake could have implications for prevention or treatment of depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yary T ; Lehto SM ; Tolmunen T ; Tuomainen TP ; Kauhanen J ; Voutilainen S ; Ruusunen A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2015.12.056 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDepression/*epidemiology\r\nDiet/*statistics & numerical data\r\nDiet Records\r\nFinland/epidemiology\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nIncidence\r\nMagnesium/*administration & dosage\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nProspective Studies\r\nRisk\r\nDepression\r\nMagnesium\r\nProspective study","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yary T, Lehto SM, Tolmunen T, Tuomainen TP, Kauhanen J, Voutilainen S, and Ruusunen A (2016) Dietary magnesium intake and the incidence of depression: A 20-year follow-up study..

The rating for classification of recommendation for an intervention was made taking both the efficacy and the side effects into consideration. RESULTS: Mood stabilizers, cyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are all effective in treating bipolar depression. Almost all antidepressant treatments with the exception of mood stabilizers have been reported to induce a manic-hypomanic switch and rapid cycling. CONCLUSIONS: Mood stabilizers, lithium in particular, are recommended as the first-line treatment. Addition of a second mood stabilizer or a cyclic antidepressant would be an appropriate next step.

Patients receiving lithium or valproate at baseline were drawn from the database of a 12-week, open-label risperidone study. The primary efficacy measure was the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Other assessments included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), Clinical Global Impression (CGI) of improvement, and safety measures. The analysis included 33 patients on lithium plus risperidone and 46 patients on valproate plus risperidone. Both subgroups had comparable baseline YMRS scores (lithium 28.2, valproate 28.7) and both had significant reductions in score by week 1 (P<0.0001). Comparable reductions in score continued for both subgroups until the end of the study (YMRS scores at week 12: lithium 4.6 and valproate 6.7). There were no significant differences in response rates (> or =50% improvement on YMRS) or remission rates (YMRS score < or = 8) between the two subgroups. At week 12, 88% of the lithium plus risperidone patients and 80% of the valproate plus risperidone patients were in remission. Similarly, HAM-D scores were significantly and comparably reduced in both subgroups, and improvement in CGI was the same. There was no difference between subgroups in the incidence of adverse events or weight gain. These data suggest that risperidone can be safely combined with either lithium or valproate, and that the efficacy is similar regardless of the mood stabilizer used.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yatham LN ; Binder C ; Kusumakar V ; Riccardelli R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00004850-200403000-00008 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nProspective Studies\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nRisperidone/*therapeutic use\r\nValproic Acid/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yatham LN, Binder C, Kusumakar V, and Riccardelli R (2004) Risperidone plus lithium versus risperidone plus valproate in acute and continuation treatment of mania..

In particular, correct diagnosis of bipolar II disorder may be delayed by years due to the predominance of depressive symptoms and the relative subtlety of hypomania, which may manifest only briefly and without elevated mood. The prevalence of bipolar II disorder varies from 0.5% to about 5% depending on the criteria used. Diagnosis can be improved by using mood disorder questionnaires, systematic probing, and prospective mood diary charting. There is a dearth of research into treatment of bipolar disorder. The limited available evidence suggests that lithium and lamotrigine may have efficacy in preventing relapse of mood episodes. Acute bipolar II depression could be treated with a combination of a mood stabilizer plus an antidepressant or pramipexole and in rare cases with antidepressant monotherapy. Hypomania will likely respond to monotherapy with antimanic agents.

The present guidelines review the new evidence and use criteria to rate strength of evidence and incorporate effectiveness, safety, and tolerability data to determine global clinical recommendations for treatment of various phases of bipolar disorder. The guidelines suggest that although pharmacotherapy forms the cornerstone of management, utilization of adjunctive psychosocial treatments and incorporation of chronic disease management model involving a healthcare team are required in providing optimal management for patients with bipolar disorder. Lithium, valproate and several atypical antipsychotics are first-line treatments for acute mania. Bipolar depression and mixed states are frequently associated with suicidal acts; therefore assessment for suicide should always be an integral part of managing any bipolar patient. Lithium, lamotrigine or various combinations of antidepressant and mood-stabilizing agents are first-line treatments for bipolar depression. First-line options in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder are lithium, lamotrigine, valproate and olanzapine. Historical and symptom profiles help with treatment selection. With the growing recognition of bipolar II disorders, it is anticipated that a larger body of evidence will become available to guide treatment of this common and disabling condition. These guidelines also discuss issues related to bipolar disorder in women and those with comorbidity and include a section on safety and monitoring.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yatham LN ; Kennedy SH ; O'Donovan C ; Parikh S ; MacQueen G ; McIntyre R ; Sharma V ; Silverstone P ; Alda M ; Baruch P ; Beaulieu S ; Daigneault A ; Milev R ; Young LT ; Ravindran A ; Schaffer A ; Connolly M ; Gorman CP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1399-5618.2005.00219.x ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAge of Onset\r\nAnticonvulsants/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety Disorders/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nBenzodiazepines/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nCanada\r\nChronic Disease\r\nComorbidity\r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\r\nDrug Monitoring\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLamotrigine\r\nLithium Carbonate/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMass Screening/methods\r\nMood Disorders/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nOlanzapine\r\nPersonality Disorders/epidemiology\r\nPrevalence\r\nQuality of Life\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSubstance-Related Disorders/epidemiology\r\nTriazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nValproic Acid/adverse effects/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yatham LN, Kennedy SH, O'Donovan C, Parikh S, MacQueen G, McIntyre R, Sharma V, Silverstone P, Alda M, Baruch P, Beaulieu S, Daigneault A, Milev R, Young LT, Ravindran A, Schaffer A, Connolly M, and Gorman CP (2005) Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder: consensus and controversies..

The last two updates were published in collaboration with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD). These 2018 CANMAT and ISBD Bipolar Treatment Guidelines represent the significant advances in the field since the last full edition was published in 2005, including updates to diagnosis and management as well as new research into pharmacological and psychological treatments. These advances have been translated into clear and easy to use recommendations for first, second, and third- line treatments, with consideration given to levels of evidence for efficacy, clinical support based on experience, and consensus ratings of safety, tolerability, and treatment-emergent switch risk. New to these guidelines, hierarchical rankings were created for first and second- line treatments recommended for acute mania, acute depression, and maintenance treatment in bipolar I disorder. Created by considering the impact of each treatment across all phases of illness, this hierarchy will further assist clinicians in making evidence-based treatment decisions. Lithium, quetiapine, divalproex, asenapine, aripiprazole, paliperidone, risperidone, and cariprazine alone or in combination are recommended as first-line treatments for acute mania. First-line options for bipolar I depression include quetiapine, lurasidone plus lithium or divalproex, lithium, lamotrigine, lurasidone, or adjunctive lamotrigine. While medications that have been shown to be effective for the acute phase should generally be continued for the maintenance phase in bipolar I disorder, there are some exceptions (such as with antidepressants); and available data suggest that lithium, quetiapine, divalproex, lamotrigine, asenapine, and aripiprazole monotherapy or combination treatments should be considered first-line for those initiating or switching treatment during the maintenance phase. In addition to addressing issues in bipolar I disorder, these guidelines also provide an overview of, and recommendations for, clinical management of bipolar II disorder, as well as advice on specific populations, such as women at various stages of the reproductive cycle, children and adolescents, and older adults. There are also discussions on the impact of specific psychiatric and medical comorbidities such as substance use, anxiety, and metabolic disorders. Finally, an overview of issues related to safety and monitoring is provided. The CANMAT and ISBD groups hope that these guidelines become a valuable tool for practitioners across the globe.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yatham LN ; Kennedy SH ; Parikh SV ; Schaffer A ; Bond DJ ; Frey BN ; Sharma V ; Goldstein BI ; Rej S ; Beaulieu S ; Alda M ; MacQueen G ; Milev RV ; Ravindran A ; O'Donovan C ; McIntosh D ; Lam RW ; Vazquez G ; Kapczinski F ; McIntyre RS ; Kozicky J ; Kanba S ; Lafer B ; Suppes T ; Calabrese JR ; Vieta E ; Malhi G ; Post RM ; Berk M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/bdi.12609 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAged\r\nAlgorithms\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/psychology/*therapy\r\nBupropion/therapeutic use\r\nChild\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLamotrigine/therapeutic use\r\nLithium Compounds/therapeutic use\r\nOlanzapine/therapeutic use\r\nQuetiapine Fumarate/therapeutic use\r\nSocieties, Medical\r\nSuicide/psychology\r\nValproic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nSuicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yatham LN, Kennedy SH, Parikh SV, Schaffer A, Bond DJ, Frey BN, Sharma V, Goldstein BI, Rej S, Beaulieu S, Alda M, MacQueen G, Milev RV, Ravindran A, O'Donovan C, McIntosh D, Lam RW, Vazquez G, Kapczinski F, McIntyre RS, Kozicky J, Kanba S, Lafer B, Suppes T, Calabrese JR, Vieta E, Malhi G, Post RM, and Berk M (2018) Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder..

While these guidelines included commentary on how mixed features may direct treatment selection, specific recommendations were not provided-a critical gap which the current update aims to address. METHOD: Overview of research regarding mixed presentations in BD, with treatment recommendations developed using a modified CANMAT/ISBD rating methodology. Limitations are discussed, including the dearth of high-quality data and reliance on expert opinion. RESULTS: No agents met threshold for first-line treatment of DSM-5 manic or depressive episodes with mixed features. For mania + mixed features second-line treatment options include asenapine, cariprazine, divalproex, and aripiprazole. In depression + mixed features, cariprazine and lurasidone are recommended as second-line options. For DSM-IV defined mixed episodes, with a longer history of research, asenapine and aripiprazole are first-line, and olanzapine (monotherapy or combination), carbamazepine, and divalproex are second-line. Research on maintenance treatments following a DSM-5 mixed presentation is extremely limited, with third-line recommendations based on expert opinion. For maintenance treatment following a DSM-IV mixed episode, quetiapine (monotherapy or combination) is first-line, and lithium and olanzapine identified as second-line options. CONCLUSION: The CANMAT and ISBD groups hope these guidelines provide valuable support for clinicians providing care to patients experiencing mixed presentations, as well as further influence investment in research to improve diagnosis and treatment of this common and complex clinical state.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yatham LN ; Chakrabarty T ; Bond DJ ; Schaffer A ; Beaulieu S ; Parikh SV ; McIntyre RS ; Milev RV ; Alda M ; Vazquez G ; Ravindran AV ; Frey BN ; Sharma V ; Goldstein BI ; Rej S ; O'Donovan C ; Tourjman V ; Kozicky JM ; Kauer-Sant'Anna M ; Malhi G ; Suppes T ; Vieta E ; Kapczinski F ; Kanba S ; Lam RW ; Kennedy SH ; Calabrese J ; Berk M ; Post R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/bdi.13135 ","Keywords":"*Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety\r\nAripiprazole/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis/drug therapy\r\nCanada\r\nHumans\r\nOlanzapine/therapeutic use\r\nValproic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nguidelines\r\nmixed features\r\npharmacotherapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yatham LN, Chakrabarty T, Bond DJ, Schaffer A, Beaulieu S, Parikh SV, McIntyre RS, Milev RV, Alda M, Vazquez G, Ravindran AV, Frey BN, Sharma V, Goldstein BI, Rej S, O'Donovan C, Tourjman V, Kozicky JM, Kauer-Sant'Anna M, Malhi G, Suppes T, Vieta E, Kapczinski F, Kanba S, Lam RW, Kennedy SH, Calabrese J, Berk M, and Post R (2021) Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) recommendations for the management of patients with bipolar disorder with mixed presentations..

However, it is unclear whether lithium has beneficial effect on neuronal repair following neuronal damage in neuronal degenerative diseases. Here, we evaluated the effect of in vivo treatment with lithium on the hippocampal neuronal repair in a mouse model of trimethyltin (TMT)-induced neuronal loss/self-repair in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (such mice referred to as \"impaired animals\") [Ogita et al. (2005) J Neurosci Res 82: 609-621]. The impaired animals had a dramatically increased number of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-incorporating cells in their dentate gyrus at the initial time window (days 3 to 5 post-TMT treatment) of the self-repair stage. A single treatment with lithium produced no significant change in the number of BrdU-incorporating cells in the dentate granule cell layer and subgranular zone on day 3 post-TMT treatment. On day 5 post-TMT treatment, however, BrdU-incorporating cells were significantly increased in number by lithium treatment for 3 days. Most interestingly, chronic treatment (15 days) with lithium increased the number of BrdU-incorporating cells positive for NeuN or doublecortin in the dentate granule cell layer of the impaired animals, but not in that of naïve animals. The results of a forced swimming test revealed that the chronic treatment with lithium improved the depression-like behavior seen in the impaired animals. Taken together, our data suggest that lithium had a beneficial effect on neuronal repair following neuronal loss in the dentate gyrus through promoted proliferation and survival/neuronal differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells in the subgranular zone.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yoneyama M ; Shiba T ; Hasebe S ; Umeda K ; Yamaguchi T ; Ogita K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0087953 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nBromodeoxyuridine/metabolism\r\nCell Survival/drug effects\r\nDentate Gyrus/*drug effects/metabolism/*pathology\r\nDepression/drug therapy/*pathology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism/pathology\r\nLithium/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nNeurons/*drug effects\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nTrimethyltin Compounds/adverse effects\r\nbeta Catenin/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yoneyama M, Shiba T, Hasebe S, Umeda K, Yamaguchi T, and Ogita K (2014) Lithium promotes neuronal repair and ameliorates depression-like behavior following trimethyltin-induced neuronal loss in the dentate gyrus..

METHOD: This 2 × 2 factorial, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with obese/overweight patients with depressive symptoms was conducted in the Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Center (EMRC), Vali-Asr, Emam Khomeini Hospital between July 2016 and February 2017. The intervention period was 12 wk. There were 140 randomized participants who were obese or overweight (mean ± SD, 38.35± 6.70 y of age; mean ± SD body mass index, 30.1 ± 3.78 kg/m(2)) with BDI ≥ 10. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio: 2000 IU/d vitamin D + zinc placebo; 30 mg/d zinc gluconate + vitamin D placebo; 2000 IU/d vitamin D + 30 mg/d zinc gluconate; or vitamin D placebo + zinc placebo for 12 wk. RESULTS: We analyzed 125 participants, and a significant decrease in BDI-II was found among those who received zinc, vitamin D, or joint zinc-vitamin D supplements compared with the placebo group (P < 0.001). Zinc was significantly more effective than vitamin D on decreasing the depression score. Supplementation with zinc, vitamin D, or a combination of the two had no significant effects on serum cortisol (P = 0.974) or BDNF (P = 0.076).

However, it remains unclear whether zinc status can predict the risk of depression development, or whether the monotherapy of zinc is superior to the combination of zinc supplementation and antidepressant medications in the treatment of depression. Therefore, this meta-analysis aimed to clarify the impact of zinc status and supplementation on depression development and status across all available evidence. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and ISI web of science were searched, up to 14 May 2020, for relevant publications. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) in observational studies, and mean and standard deviation (SD) for the change in depression score in RCTs were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: The meta-analysis of RCTs indicated that zinc supplementation significantly lowered depressive symptom scores of depressed patients [weighted mean difference (WMD = -4.15 point; 95% CI: -6.56, -1.75 point; P < 0.01)], and the improvement in depression status occurred only when zinc supplementation was prescribed as a monotherapy. The cohort studies showed that the highest level of zinc intake was associated with a 28% reduced risk of depression (RR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.82; I(2) = 13.90). Dose-response analyses revealed a significant non-linear effect of baseline mood status on depression score. CONCLUSION: Current evidence from observational studies and RCT's supports the potential benefits zinc to reduce the risk of, and alleviate, depression. However, further trials are needed to confirm the beneficial effect of zinc as a monotherapy versus adjunctive therapies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yosaee S ; Clark CCT ; Keshtkaran Z ; Ashourpour M ; Keshani P ; Soltani S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.08.001 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\n*Depression/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\n*Zinc\r\nDepression\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nMonotherapy\r\nZinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yosaee S, Clark CCT, Keshtkaran Z, Ashourpour M, Keshani P, and Soltani S (2022) Zinc in depression: From development to treatment: A comparative/ dose response meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials..

It has been reported, however, that 30-40% of patients with MDD who received SSRIs failed to respond to treatment. Use of lithium (Li) to augment SSRIs seems to be the most common strategy in such cases. It was recently demonstrated that atypical antipsychotics are effective augmentation agents in MDD. Here, we present a randomized controlled study that compared augmentation with Li, olanzapine (OLA) or aripiprazole (ARI) in paroxetine-refractory patients with MDD. METHODS: Participants were 30 patients who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria for MDD and refractory to paroxetine treatment. Treatment with Li, OLA or ARI was added to paroxetine in a randomized protocol for 4 weeks. We defined the patients whose scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression decreased 50% or more as responders. RESULTS: Two patients dropped out because of adverse effects. Response rates to Li, OLA or ARI augmentation were 4/10 (40%), 3/10 (30%) and 4/10 (40%), respectively. In addition, Li, OLA and ARI did not influence plasma paroxetine concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that OLA or ARI could be used as alternatives to Li as options for patients who do not respond to paroxetine treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yoshimura R ; Hori H ; Umene-Nakano W ; Ikenouchi-Sugita A ; Katsuki A ; Atake K ; Nakamura J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/2045125313514767 ","Keywords":"aripiprazole\r\naugmentation\r\nlithium\r\nmajor depressive disorder olanzapine\r\nparoxetine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yoshimura R, Hori H, Umene-Nakano W, Ikenouchi-Sugita A, Katsuki A, Atake K, and Nakamura J (2014) Comparison of lithium, aripiprazole and olanzapine as augmentation to paroxetine for inpatients with major depressive disorder..

RESULTS: The remission rate in the AGT group (60.2%) was approximately 10% greater than that in the TAU group (49.7%). The median number of days to achieve remission in the AGT group (93 days) was half as long as that in the TAU group (191 days). The hazard ratio of remission was 1.5 (95% confidence interval: = 1.2-1.8). A higher rate of lithium augmentation in the AGT group (20.5%) compared to the TAU (4.7%) may have led to the greater remission rate. Most participants who did not achieve remission either during the initial or second treatment steps dropped out from AGT. CONCLUSIONS: AGT may be superior to TAU for patients with mild or moderate MDD, based on the remission rates achieved.

They have also observed that lithium causes granulocytosis and lymphopenia while it enhances immunological activities of monocytes and lymphocytes. In fact, clinicians have long used lithium to treat granulocytopenia resulting from radiation and chemotherapy, to boost immunoglobulins after vaccination, and to enhance natural killer activity. Recent studies revealed a mechanism that ties together these disparate effects of lithium. Lithium acts through multiple pathways to inhibit glycogen synthetase kinase-3beta (GSK3 beta). This enzyme phosphorylates and inhibits nuclear factors that turn on cell growth and protection programs, including the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and WNT/beta-catenin. In animals, lithium upregulates neurotrophins, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor, neurotrophin-3 (NT3), as well as receptors to these growth factors in brain. Lithium also stimulates proliferation of stem cells, including bone marrow and neural stem cells in the subventricular zone, striatum, and forebrain. The stimulation of endogenous neural stem cells may explain why lithium increases brain cell density and volume in patients with bipolar disorders. Lithium also increases brain concentrations of the neuronal markers n-acetyl-aspartate and myoinositol. Lithium also remarkably protects neurons against glutamate, seizures, and apoptosis due to a wide variety of neurotoxins. The effective dose range for lithium is 0.6-1.0 mM in serum and >1.5 mM may be toxic. Serum lithium levels of 1.5-2.0 mM may have mild and reversible toxic effects on kidney, liver, heart, and glands. Serum levels of >2 mM may be associated with neurological symptoms, including cerebellar dysfunction. Prolonged lithium intoxication >2 mM can cause permanent brain damage. Lithium has low mutagenic and carcinogenic risk. Lithium is still the most effective therapy for depression. It \"cures\" a third of the patients with manic depression, improves the lives of about a third, and is ineffective in about a third. Recent studies suggest that some anticonvulsants (i.e., valproate, carbamapazine, and lamotrigene) may be useful in patients that do not respond to lithium. Lithium has been reported to be beneficial in animal models of brain injury, stroke, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal cord injury, and other conditions.

Lithium in various forms was used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders before falling into disuse because of concerns over toxicity. The Australian psychiatrist John Cade rediscovered lithium for the treatment of mania in 1949 and the Danish psychiatrist Mogens Schou did one of the first randomised controlled trials in mania in 1954 assessing lithium use, also suggesting the potential for use of lithium as a prophylactic drug for depressive illness. The use of lithium was opposed in the 1960s by some researchers from the Maudsley Hospital, 1 although evidence from later clinical trials did not support this position. Lithium is now accepted as a treatment for bipolar disorder in evidence-based guidelines, and systematic reviews show the adverse effects to be acceptable, albeit with a continuing concern about the effects of long-term use on renal function. 2 Despite the increasing evidence of benefits, lithium seems to be being used less. Other benefits of lithium treatment have been described, including a reduction of mortality and suicide by more than 60% in people with major depression or bipolar disorder, 3 a putative preventative effect for dementia, 4 and, perhaps most notably, a report published in 2016 showed that lithium is associated with a reduced overall cancer risk in patients with bipolar disorder, and a dose–response relationship for cancer risk reduction was observed. 5","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Young AH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30232-8 ","Keywords":"*Bipolar Disorder\r\nCohort Studies\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major\r\nFinland\r\nHumans\r\nLithium\r\nPatient Readmission","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Young AH (2017) Lithium for long-term treatment of unipolar depression..

Depression affects nearly 15% of the population. The standard of care for the last 50 years has focused on monoamine neurotransmitters, including such treatments as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). However, these treatments have significant limitations: they can take weeks before showing mood-altering effects, and only one to two out of ten patients shows clinical effects beyond those associated with placebo. A major paradigm shift in research into the treatment of depression is underway, based on promising results with the glutamatergic NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine. Further research has demonstrated the significance of glutamatergic pathways in depression and the association of this system with the stress pathway and magnesium homeostasis. Treatment with NMDA receptor antagonists and magnesium have shown the ability to sprout new synaptic connections and reverse stress-induced neural changes, opening up promising new territory for the development of drugs to meet the unmet need in patients with clinical depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zarate C ; Duman RS ; Liu G ; Sartori S ; Quiroz J ; Murck H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/nyas.12223 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Depression/drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nExcitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nKetamine/*therapeutic use\r\nMagnesium/*metabolism\r\nReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use\r\nSynapses/metabolism\r\nCP-AMPA\r\nNMDA\r\nSNRI\r\nSSRI\r\ndepression\r\nglutamate antagonist\r\nglutamine\r\nketamine\r\nmagnesium\r\nscopolamine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zarate C, Duman RS, Liu G, Sartori S, Quiroz J, and Murck H (2013) New paradigms for treatment-resistant depression..

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the antidepressant-like effect of (p-ClPhSe)(2) on mice made diabetic by streptozotocin (STZ) and the contribution of cerebral cortical Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway for this effect. METHODS: Male adult Swiss mice received streptozotocin (STZ, 200 mg/kg, i.p.) to induce diabetes (glycemia ≥ 200 mg/dl) or citrate buffer (5 ml/kg, control group). The mice were treated with (p-ClPhSe)(2) at the dose of 5 mg/kg, i.g., for 7 days. Mice performed behavior tests, tail suspension (TST), and forced swimming tests (FST), to evaluate depressive-like phenotype. RESULTS: Diabetic mice showed an increase in immobility time in the TST and FST when compared to the control group. The protein contents of Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway were decreased in the cerebral cortex of diabetic mice. Diabetic mice had an increase in the relative adrenal weight and a decrease in the protein content of glucocorticoid receptor. The levels of TBARS and RS and SOD activity were found altered in the cerebral cortex of diabetic mice. The number of FJC-positive cells was increased in the cerebral cortex of diabetic mice. Treatment with (p-ClPhSe)(2) was effective against depressive-like phenotype, oxidative stress, and FJC-positive cells of diabetic mice. (p-ClPhSe)(2) did not reverse the parameters of HPA axis evaluated in this study. (p-ClPhSe)(2) modulated the cerebral cortical Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in diabetic mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the contribution of cerebral cortical Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in the (p-ClPhSe)(2) antidepressant-like action in diabetic mice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zborowski VA ; Heck SO ; Vencato M ; Pinton S ; Marques LS ; Nogueira CW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00213-019-05372-3 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nCerebral Cortex/drug effects/metabolism\r\nDepression/blood/drug therapy\r\nDiabetes Mellitus, Experimental/blood/chemically induced/*drug therapy\r\nHeme Oxygenase-1/*metabolism\r\nKelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1/*metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMembrane Proteins/*metabolism\r\nMice\r\nNF-E2-Related Factor 2/*metabolism\r\nOrganoselenium Compounds/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nOxidative Stress/drug effects/physiology\r\nSignal Transduction/drug effects/physiology\r\nStreptozocin/toxicity\r\nDepressive-like\r\nDiabetes\r\nKeap1/Nrf2/HO-1\r\nOrganoselenium\r\nSelenium","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zborowski VA, Heck SO, Vencato M, Pinton S, Marques LS, and Nogueira CW (2020) Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway contributes to p-chlorodiphenyl diselenide antidepressant-like action in diabetic mice..

At present, the mechanisms underlying these side-effects are not fully understood, and no effective treatment is available. Here, we show that the short-term memory deficits and anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors induced by intraperitoneal injections of OXA (4 mg/kg per day for 5 consecutive days) were accompanied by synaptic dysfunction and downregulation of the NR2B subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the hippocampus, which is critically involved in memory and emotion. The OXA-induced behavioral and synaptic changes were prevented by chronic oral administration of magnesium-L-threonate (L-TAMS, 604 mg/kg per day, from 2 days before until the end of experiments). We found that OXA injections significantly reduced the free Mg(2+) in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (from ~ 0.8 mmol/L to ~ 0.6 mmol/L). The Mg(2+) deficiency (0.6 mmol/L) upregulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and phospho-p65 (p-p65), an active form of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), and downregulated the NR2B subunit in cultured hippocampal slices. Oral L-TAMS prevented the OXA-induced upregulation of TNF-α and p-p65, as well as microglial activation in the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex. Finally, similar to oral L-TAMS, intracerebroventricular injection of PDTC, an NF-κB inhibitor, also prevented the OXA-induced memory/emotional deficits and the changes in TNF-α, p-p65, and microglia. Taken together, the activation of TNF-α/NF-κB signaling resulting from reduced brain Mg(2+) is responsible for the memory/emotional deficits induced by OXA. Chronic oral L-TAMS may be a novel approach to treating chemotherapy-induced memory/emotional deficits.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zhou X ; Huang Z ; Zhang J ; Chen JL ; Yao PW ; Mai CL ; Mai JZ ; Zhang H ; Liu XG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s12264-020-00563-x ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAnimals\r\nButyrates\r\nEmotions\r\n*Magnesium\r\n*NF-kappa B\r\nOxaliplatin\r\nRats\r\nTumor Necrosis Factor-alpha\r\nCognitive deficit\r\nHippocampus\r\nMagnesium-L-threonate\r\nMedial prefrontal cortex\r\nNuclear factor-kappaB\r\nOxaliplatin\r\nTumor necrosis factor-alpha","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zhou X, Huang Z, Zhang J, Chen JL, Yao PW, Mai CL, Mai JZ, Zhang H, and Liu XG (2021) Chronic Oral Administration of Magnesium-L-Threonate Prevents Oxaliplatin-Induced Memory and Emotional Deficits by Normalization of TNF-α/NF-κB Signaling in Rats..

However, so far, it is lack of evidence to support this proposition. The main aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that lithium bidirectionally regulates depression- and mania-related brain functional abnormalities in patients with BP. We also assessed the effects of lithium, alone and in combination with other pharmacological treatments, on patients' cognitive performance. We enrolled 149 drug-naïve patients with BP; 99 patients experiencing first depressive episodes were allocated randomly to four treatment groups [lithium (DP/Li), lithium with lamotrigine (LTG; DP/Li+LTG), LTG (DP/LTG), and valproate (VPA) with LTG (DP/VPA+LTG)], and 50 experiencing first hypo-manic episodes were allocated to two treatment groups (MA/Li and MA/VPA). For comparative analysis, 60 age-matched healthy individuals were also recruited. Whole-brain global and regional resting-state cerebral blood flow (rs-CBF) and cognitive alterations were examined before and after 12-week treatment. We have the following findings: DP/Li+LTG, and to a lesser extent DP/Li, alleviated the depression-related reduction in rs-CBF. MA/VPA and MA/Li reversed the mania-related elevation of rs-CBF completely and partially, respectively. Lithium alone improved cognitive performance during depressive and manic episodes; other tested treatments have no such effect or worsened cognitive ability. Our results showed that lithium bidirectionally regulates depression- and mania-associated brain functional abnormalities in patients with BP. Lithium monotherapy has a better antimanic effect than VPA, is superior to other tested treatments in improving cognition during the course of BP, and has satisfactory antidepressant effects in patients with BP.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zhuo C ; Chen G ; Chen J ; Tian H ; Ma X ; Li Q ; Yang L ; Zhang Q ; Li R ; Song X ; Huang C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyt.2022.963005 ","Keywords":"bipolar disorder\r\ncerebral blood flow\r\ncognition\r\ndepression\r\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\r\nlithium\r\nmania","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zhuo C, Chen G, Chen J, Tian H, Ma X, Li Q, Yang L, Zhang Q, Li R, Song X, and Huang C (2022) Lithium bidirectionally regulates depression- and mania-related brain functional alterations without worsening cognitive function in patients with bipolar disorder..

Bi-directional regulation (i.e. affecting manic symptoms and depressive symptoms) by Li has not been demonstrated. This study explored: (1) bidirectional regulation by Li in murine models of depression, mania, and bipolar disorder (BP); and (2) potential Li synergism with antidepressant/anti-mania agents. The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and ketamine-induced mania (KM) models were used. These methods were used in series to produce a BP model. In vivo two-photon imaging was used to visualize Ca(2+) activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Depressiveness, mania, and cognitive function were assessed with the forced swim task (FST), open field activity (OFA) task, and novel object recognition task, respectively. In CUMS mice, Ca(2+) activity was increased strongly by Li and weakly by lamotrigine (LTG) or valproate (VPA), and LTG co-administration reduced Li and VPA monotherapy effects; depressive immobility in the FST was attenuated by Li or LTG, and attenuated more strongly by LTG-VPA or LTG-Li; novel object exploration was increased strongly by Li and weakly by LTG-Li, and reduced by LTG, VPA, or LTG-VPA. In KM mice, Li or VPA attenuated OFA mania symptoms and normalized Ca(2+) activity partially; Li improved cognitive function while VPA exacerbated the KM alteration. These patterns were replicated in the respective BP model phases. Lithium had bi-directional, albeit weak, mood regulation effects and a cognitive supporting effect. Li co-administration with antidepressant/-manic agents enhanced mood-regulatory efficacy while attenuating their cognitive-impairing effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zhuo C ; Zhou C ; Tian H ; Li Q ; Chen J ; Yang L ; Zhang Q ; Li R ; Ma X ; Cai Z ; Chen G ; Xu Y ; Song X ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41398-022-02087-6 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnticonvulsants/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/psychology\r\n*Cognitive Dysfunction/drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nLamotrigine/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nLithium/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nMice\r\nValproic Acid","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zhuo C, Zhou C, Tian H, Li Q, Chen J, Yang L, Zhang Q, Li R, Ma X, Cai Z, Chen G, Xu Y, and Song X (2022) Lithium produces bi-directionally regulation of mood disturbance, acts synergistically with anti-depressive/-manic agents, and did not deteriorate the cognitive impairment in murine model of bipolar disorder..

Research has been conducted in order to explore the factors that led to this development and to provide arguments for the need to reverse this trend. METHOD: This paper represents a narrative review of the literature containing retrieved research articles focusing on the efficacy of lithium. The papers included in this overview were published prior to June 2016; additional papers were identified by searching the reference lists of reviewed articles. Taking into account the amount of literature available, no search can be exhaustive; on the other hand, the studies consulted, all of which explore the effectiveness of various compounds, may have their own limitations as well. RESULTS: The evidence of the effectiveness of lithium in the treatment of acute mania, acute bipolar depression and the prevention of manic and depressive episodes is compelling. Lithium is the most effective augmentation agent in treatment-resistant depression. Its anti-suicidal effects are well established. The neuroprotective effects of lithium have been demonstrated in case-control studies and in population-based research. It has been established that starting lithium early in the course of the disorder reduces the rates of treatment non-response. CONCLUSIONS: Despite abundant evidence regarding the efficacy of lithium and its effectiveness in the treatment of bipolar disorders, its use is declining at the beginning of the 21st century. It is of paramount importance to keep reminding psychiatrists and educating physicians about the unique properties of lithium and about monitoring patients treated with lithium, since it has been suggested that lithium should once again become the first-line treatment for bipolar disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zivanovic O ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0004867417695889 ","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\n*Drug Prescriptions\r\nHumans\r\nLithium Compounds/*pharmacology\r\n*Practice Patterns, Physicians'\r\nLithium\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nlong-term treatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zivanovic O (2017) Lithium: A classic drug-Frequently discussed, but, sadly, seldom prescribed!.

We reviewed all available published studies of \"standard\" somatic treatments (lithium, antidepressant and anticonvulsant agents, and electroconvulsive therapy [ECT]) reporting three or more depressed bipolar patients who were not psychotic, rapid cycling, or previously treatment refractory. We also reviewed all studies of \"nonstandard\" pharmacologic treatments involving even a single case of a depressed bipolar patient. Data sources included the MEDLINE database and relevant references from articles obtained in this search and in major reviews. Five of seven studies comparing ECT with antidepressant agents find ECT more efficacious. Eight of nine controlled comparisons find lithium superior to placebo in depressed bipolar patients. Three controlled comparisons of lithium to tricyclic antidepressants suggest that lithium is equivalent to tricyclic drugs in such patients. Three double-blind, controlled studies indicate that carbamazepine is more effective than placebo. Limited data on other antidepressant classes suggest that monoamine oxidase inhibitors, bupropion, and serotonergic agents may offer some advantages over tricyclic antidepressants in this population. Some \"nonstandard\" treatments also show some potential in bipolar patients. The possibility of switching into a manic episode is an important consideration with many of the agents studied, although little remains known about spontaneous versus treatment-associated mood shifts. In contrast to the extensive literature on the acute treatment of the manic phase of bipolar disorder and on the prophylaxis of manic and depressive episodes, there are few studies of treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder, and their results generally are limited or inconclusive. Lithium generated a revolution in psychiatric treatment, but the treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder remains a relatively neglected corner of the field. Several study designs may help to augment knowledge in the treatment of bipolar depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zornberg GL ; Pope HG Jr; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLithium/therapeutic use\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zornberg GL, and Pope HG Jr (1993) Treatment of depression in bipolar disorder: new directions for research..
