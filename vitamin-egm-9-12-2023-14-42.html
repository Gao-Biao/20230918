Herein, we investigated the chemical composition of hexane extract from Origanum vulgare (O. vulgare) leaves as well as its possible protective effects against thioacetamide (TAA)-induced HE in rats. GC-MS analysis of the extract revealed tentative identification of twenty-five compounds (82.93%), predominated by cholesten-3-one (27.30%), followed by γ-tocopherol (13.52%), α-tocopherol (5.01%), β-amyrin (5.24%) and α-amyrin (4.89%). Albino rats were distributed into seven groups (n = 7). G(1) served as negative control; G(2) and G(3) served as controls treated with O. vulgare (100 and 200 mg/kg/p.o b.w, respectively); G(4) served as TAA-positive control group (100 mg/kg/day/i.p., three alternative days per week for six weeks); G5, G6, and G7 served as TAA -induced HE rat model that received O. vulgare 100, O. vulgare 200, and silymarin (100 mg/kg of SILY, as standard drug), respectively. TAA showed depressive and anxiety-like behaviors in forced swimming test (FST) and reduction of cognitive score in elevated plus-maze test (EPMT) as well as impairment of locomotor and exploratory activities in open-field test (OFT). TAA caused a significant decline in body weight gain; however, the relative liver weight and brain water content were statistically increased. TAA-intoxicated rats showed significant increase of serum biomarker enzymes, proinflammatory cytokines, blood ammonia levels, brain serotonin, acetyl cholinesterase and cellular lipid peroxidation with significant decrease of brain dopamine, norepinephrine, antioxidant status. The hepatoprotective/neuro-protective activities of O. vulgare was found to be comparable with that of SILY in HE rats model. Where, treatment of TAA-intoxicated rats with O. vulgare attenuated anxiety, depressive-related behaviors, and reduced the biochemical changes in HE-induced by TAA. Therefore, O. vulgare could be an excellent hepato-/neuroprotective against hepatic injury and HE via improving the oxidative/inflammatory status through its antioxidant and neuro-modulatory properties and its effect is equal to that of SILY.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Abdelghffar EAR ; El-Nashar HAS ; Fayez S ; Obaid WA ; Eldahshan OA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-022-20412-3 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nRats\r\nalpha-Tocopherol/metabolism\r\nAmmonia/metabolism\r\nAntioxidants/metabolism\r\nBiomarkers/metabolism\r\nCholinesterases/metabolism\r\nCytokines/metabolism\r\nDopamine/metabolism\r\ngamma-Tocopherol/pharmacology\r\n*Hepatic Encephalopathy/metabolism\r\nHexanes\r\nLiver/metabolism\r\nNeurotransmitter Agents/metabolism\r\nNorepinephrine/metabolism\r\n*Origanum/chemistry\r\nOxidative Stress\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\n*Silymarin/pharmacology\r\nThioacetamide\r\nWater/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Abdelghffar EAR, El-Nashar HAS, Fayez S, Obaid WA, and Eldahshan OA (2022) Ameliorative effect of oregano (Origanum vulgare) versus silymarin in experimentally induced hepatic encephalopathy..

The syndrome appears during luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and is a common disorder of reproductive age. Different treatments have been introduced for the syndrome due to its unknown complicated causes. Vitamin B1 (Thiamin) may reduce symptoms of the syndrome through affecting the performance of coenzymes in the metabolism of carbohydrates and main branch of amino acid that plays an important role in appearance of physical and mental symptoms of the PMS. Vitamin B1 is the first water-soluble discovered vitamin. As it is effective in neural activity and muscle tonus in different body activities, including hematopoiesis, metabolism of carbohydrates, activities of the central nervous system and neuromuscular system, etc., it can be effective in this dysmenorrhea that is a disorder resulting from uterine muscular contraction. There are no enough studies and research on the effect of vitamin B1 on the symptoms of PMS, therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effect of vitamin B1 on the symptoms of PMS in students residing at dormitories of Jahrom University of Medical Sciences in 2013. METHODS: In this double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, 80 students with PMS residing at dormitories of Jahrom University of Medical Sciences were divided randomly into two groups, vitamin B1 and placebo. The severity of the symptoms of PMS in two cycles, before the intervention and during the intervention, was recorded by the students. The data were collected using an information collection form, PMS provisional diagnosis form, daily status record form, Beck Depression Inventory. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: There was no significant difference among the studied variables in terms of confounding variables. The comparison of vitamin B1 group before the intervention with that after the intervention showed that vitamin B1 reduced mean mental (35.08%) and physical (21.2%) symptoms significantly (P < 0.0001). Moreover, there was a significant difference between vitamin B1 and placebo groups in terms of mean mental and physical symptoms, as mean symptoms in vitamin B1 group was significantly lower than that in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: It seems that vitamin B1 is effective in recovery of mental and physical symptoms of PMS. Therefore, this vitamin can be used to reach a major goal of midwifery, that is, reduction of symptom severity of PMS, without any side effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Abdollahifard S ; Rahmanian Koshkaki A; Moazamiyanfar R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.5539/gjhs.v6n6p144 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIran\r\nPlacebos\r\nPremenstrual Syndrome/*drug therapy\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nThiamine/*therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Abdollahifard S, Rahmanian Koshkaki A, and Moazamiyanfar R (2014) The effects of vitamin B1 on ameliorating the premenstrual syndrome symptoms..

In Jordan, the number of people visiting psychiatric clinics has been increasing over the past few years. Low level of vitamin D is associated with musculoskeletal pain (MSP) and is increasingly linked to the pathology of mental disorders. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among psychiatric outpatients and their response to vitamin D supplementation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 74 outpatients and gender- and age-matched controls were involved. Outpatients were prediagnosed by a psychiatrist to have mental disorders (anxiety, depression, others). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess psychological symptoms before and after treatment. Patients with low vitamin D received oral vitamin D supplementation. RESULTS: 83.8% had vitamin D deficiency, and 95.95% experienced MSP compared to 40.6% and 0.0% of the controls, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in vitamin D level (p = 0.011) and the total number of pain sites (p = 0.032) among psychiatric outpatient subgroups. HADS-anxiety and HADS-depression were significantly and inversely associated with vitamin D level and total daily calcium intake, and positively associated with pain severity. Relative to baseline, all measured outcome parameters significantly improved after vitamin D supplementation plus dairy products in 40 psychiatric outpatients. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency and MSP were very common among Jordanian psychiatric outpatients independent of diagnostic categories. Vitamin D supplementation plus increased dairy-product intake had a significant positive impact on physical and mental health status in psychiatric outpatients. Screening for vitamin D deficiency and daily calcium intake could be routine for psychiatric evaluation. .","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Abdul-Razzak KK ; Almanasrah SO ; Obeidat BA ; Khasawneh AG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.5414/CP203309 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAffect/*drug effects\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nCase-Control Studies\r\nDairy Products\r\nDepression/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nJordan/epidemiology\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNutritive Value\r\n*Outpatients\r\nPrevalence\r\nRecommended Dietary Allowances\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin D/adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/blood/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Abdul-Razzak KK, Almanasrah SO, Obeidat BA, and Khasawneh AG (2018) Vitamin D is a potential antidepressant in psychiatric outpatients ..

Vitamin D is shown to be linked to OAB syndrome, which exacerbated by stress conditions. This study evaluated the relationship between vitamin D status, daily calcium intake and OAB, and the associated psychological symptoms. METHODS: The study included 55 patients with OAB and 129 healthy controls. Psychological symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Serum vitamin D was measured. Patients with OAB with low vitamin D level received orally vitamin D supplementation. Urinary symptoms, psychological symptoms, and quality of life were evaluated before and after vitamin D supplementation plus dairy products. RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency was more prevalent in cases (80%) vs controls (34.9%). Depression (43.7% vs 20.2%) and anxiety (52.8% vs 10.9%) scores (HADS, ≥8) were also more frequent in cases vs controls, respectively. Some 85.5% of the patients' group had musculoskeletal pain vs 0.0% for the control. Depression was negatively correlated with daily calcium intake and positively with anxiety. Logistic regression analysis revealed that age, vitamin D, and anxiety scores were significant predictors of OAB. Vitamin D supplements with increased calcium intake had significant improvement in urinary symptoms, psychological distress, and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplements and improved calcium intake may improve urinary and psychological symptoms and quality of life among patients with OAB syndrome. Assessment for vitamin D status in patients with OAB may be warranted.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Abdul-Razzak KK ; Alshogran OY ; Altawalbeh SM ; Al-Ghalayini IF ; Al-Ghazo MA ; Alazab RS ; Halalsheh OM ; Sahawneh FE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/nau.23975 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAnxiety/blood/*complications/psychology\r\nCalcium/*blood\r\nCase-Control Studies\r\nDepression/blood/*complications/psychology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nQuality of Life\r\nUrinary Bladder, Overactive/blood/*complications/psychology\r\nVitamin D/*blood\r\nYoung Adult\r\nanxiety\r\ncalcium\r\noveractive bladder\r\nquality of life\r\nvitamin D\r\nvitamin D supplementation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Abdul-Razzak KK, Alshogran OY, Altawalbeh SM, Al-Ghalayini IF, Al-Ghazo MA, Alazab RS, Halalsheh OM, and Sahawneh FE (2019) Overactive bladder and associated psychological symptoms: A possible link to vitamin D and calcium..

Because there is more than one syndrome and nervous tension is one of the most common symptoms, the term premenstrual tension syndromes (PMTS) is used. The most common subgroup, PMT-A, consists of premenstrual anxiety, irritability and nervous tension, sometimes expressed in behavior patterns detrimental to self, family and society. Elevated blood estrogen and low progesterone have been observed in this subgroup. Administration of vitamin B6 at doses of 200-800 mg/day reduces blood estrogen, increases progesterone and results in improved symptoms under double-blind conditions. Women in this subgroup consume an excessive amount of dairy products and refined sugar, and progesterone may be of value in them. The second-most-common subgroup, PMT-H, is associated with symptoms of water and salt retention, abdominal bloating, mastalgia and weight gain. The severe form of PMT-H is associated with elevated serum aldosterone. Vitamin B6 at high dosage suppresses aldosterone and results in diuresis and clinical improvement. Vitamin E helps the breast symptoms. Methylxanthines and nicotine should be curtailed and sodium limited to 3 gm/day. PMT-C is characterized by premenstrual craving for sweets, increased appetite and indulgence in eating refined sugar followed by palpitation, fatigue, fainting spells, headache and sometimes the shakes. PMT-C patients have increased carbohydrate tolerance and low red-cell magnesium. Adequate magnesium replacement results in improved glucose tolerance tests and decreased PMT-C symptoms. Deficiency of the prostaglandin PGE1 may also be involved in PMT-C. PMT-D is the least common but most dangerous because suicide is most frequent in this subgroup. The symptoms are depression, withdrawal, insomnia, forgetfulness and confusion. In ten PMT-D patients the mean blood estrogen was lower and the mean blood progesterone higher than normal during the midluteal phase. Elevated adrenal androgens are observed in some hirsute PMT-D patients. Two PMT-D patients with normal blood progesterone and estrogens had high lead levels in hair tissue and chronic lead intoxication. This subgroups needs careful medical attention when the symptoms are severe. Therapy should be individualized according to the results of the evaluation.","Comments":"narrative review","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Abraham GE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Diet\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMagnesium Deficiency/complications\r\nPremenstrual Syndrome/diagnosis/*diet therapy/etiology\r\nVitamin B Deficiency/complications","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Abraham GE (1983) Nutritional factors in the etiology of the premenstrual tension syndromes..

The potentials of polyphenols and antioxidants as effective protective agents following heavy metal-induced neurotoxicity are emerging. We therefore explored the neuroprotective potentials of gallic and ascorbic acids in CdCl(2)-induced neurotoxicity. Seventy-two Wistar rats were divided into six groups. Group A received distilled water, B: 3 mg/kg CdCl(2), C: 3 mg/kg CdCl(2) + 20 mg/kg gallic acid (GA), D: 3 mg/kg CdCl(2) + 10 mg/kg ascorbic acid (AA), E: 20 mg/kg GA and F: 10 mg/kg AA orally for 21 days. Depression, anxiety, locomotion, learning and memory were assessed using a battery of tests. Neuronal structure and myelin expression were assessed with histological staining and immunofluorescence. The Morris Water Maze test revealed significant increase in escape latency in CdCl(2) group relative to rats concurrently treated with GA or AA. Similarly, time spent in the target quadrant was reduced significantly in CdCl(2) group relative to other groups. Concomitant administration of gallic acid led to significant reduction in the durations of immobility and freezing that were elevated in CdCl(2) group during forced swim and open field tests respectively. Furthermore, GA and AA restored myelin integrity and neuronal loss observed in the CdCl(2) group. We conclude that gallic and ascorbic acids enhance learning and memory, decrease anxiety and depressive-like behavior in CdCl(2)-induced neurotoxicity with accompanying myelin-protective ability.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Adebiyi O ; Adigun K ; David-Odewumi P ; Akindele U ; Olayemi F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-022-18432-0 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntioxidants/metabolism/pharmacology\r\n*Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology\r\nCadmium/pharmacology\r\n*Cadmium Chloride/pharmacology\r\nCognition\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nGallic Acid/pharmacology\r\nOxidative Stress\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Adebiyi O, Adigun K, David-Odewumi P, Akindele U, and Olayemi F (2022) Gallic and ascorbic acids supplementation alleviate cognitive deficits and neuropathological damage exerted by cadmium chloride in Wistar rats..

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a study to examine the effect of Vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation on neuropsychiatric manifestations, CD4 count, and anthropometric measurements in HIV-positive patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three different groups of HIV patients, namely, HIV patients with tuberculosis, HIV patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations, and asymptomatic HIV patients with 50 patients in each group were included in the study. Baseline and follow-up CD4 count, anthropometric measurements, neuropsychiatric assessments, Vitamin B12, and folic acid estimation were done. RESULTS: The prevalence of folic acid deficiency was 27.1% in Group I, 31.9% in Group II, and 23.4% in Group III. The prevalence of Vitamin B12 deficiency was 8.16% in Group I, 6.12% in Group II, and 4.16% in Group III. HIV patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations were noted to have the lowest mean mini-mental score. After the supplementation of vitamins, anthropometric measurements, MMSE as well as Hamilton depression scores, improved in all the three groups whereas Hamilton anxiety scores improved only in Group III. The CD4 count also improved in Groups I and II after the supplementation of vitamins. CONCLUSION: Folic acid deficiency was highest among neuropsychiatric patients. The majority of people who had a folic acid deficiency have shown improvement in their neuropsychiatric assessment scores as well as CD4 count after its supplementation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Adhikari PM ; Chowta MN ; Ramapuram JT ; Rao SB ; Udupa K ; Acharya SD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4103/0976-3147.182774 ","Keywords":"CD4 count\r\nHIV\r\nVitamin B12\r\nfolic acid","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Adhikari PM, Chowta MN, Ramapuram JT, Rao SB, Udupa K, and Acharya SD (2016) Effect of Vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation on neuropsychiatric symptoms and immune response in HIV-positive patients..

One of the possible mechanisms in the pathophysiology of these mood disorders has been reported as oxidative stress and inflammation. In the light of this information, it is important to determine the relationship between antioxidant nutrients (such as vitamin D) and these diseases. There are points where the brain regions involved in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety and vitamin D metabolism intersect. RECENT FINDINGS: Low vitamin D levels are associated with increased symptoms of depression and anxiety. For this reason, vitamin D screening should be performed in the prevention and treatment planning of these mood disorders. Vitamin D, which has antioxidant properties and activity in brain tissue, is important for mood disorders preventions or treatments but serum levels must be followed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Akpınar Ş ; Karadağ MG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s13668-022-00441-0 ","Keywords":"Antioxidant\r\nAnxiety\r\nCholecalciferol\r\nDepression\r\nMood disorders\r\nVitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Akpınar Ş, and Karadağ MG (2022) Is Vitamin D Important in Anxiety or Depression?

AIM: This study aimed to assess the association between levels of daytime vs. nighttime outdoor activity and mental health among a sample of UAE residents during the lockdown period. METHOD: An opportunity sample of 245 participants completed an online survey assessing levels of depression, somatic symptoms, daytime and nighttime activity levels. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression revealed that daytime activity, but not nighttime activity, was associated with a lower risk of clinically significant depressive and somatic symptomatology. CONCLUSION: The association of better mental health with daytime not nighttime outdoor activity could be possibly attributed to vitamin D, but further studies are needed to confirm this speculation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Al Anouti F ; Thomas J ; Karras S ; El Asswad N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fpubh.2022.829362 ","Keywords":"*COVID-19/epidemiology\r\nCommunicable Disease Control\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nHealth Status\r\nHumans\r\nPandemics\r\nUnited Arab Emirates/epidemiology\r\nCOVID-19\r\nUnited Arab Emirates\r\ndepressive symptoms\r\nsomatization\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Al Anouti F, Thomas J, Karras S, and El Asswad N (2022) Outdoor Activity in the Daytime, but Not the Nighttime, Predicts Better Mental Health Status During the COVID-19 Curfew in the United Arab Emirates..

Previous studies focused on DS use for maintaining or improving overall health; Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of DSs for mental health among the SA population and to determine the factors that affect their use. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was based on an online survey of Saudi Arabian participants between July and August 2021 with an anonymous, self-completed questionnaire distributed using convenience sampling. The questionnaire included queries related to demographic information, DS use assessment, and mental health evaluation using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), questionnaire, and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). RESULTS: In total, 443 participants from various regions of Saudi Arabia completed the questionnaire. The prevalence of DS use in the Saudi population was 44%. Vitamin D (28%) and melatonin (20%) were the most commonly reported DSs used for mental health. The odds of DS use were three times higher in responders with previous mental health diagnoses (OR: 2.972; 95% CI: 1.602-5.515). Furthermore, the chances of using DSs almost doubled in patients with sub-threshold and moderate to severe insomnia (OR: 1.930; 95% CI: 1.191-3.126 and OR: 2.485; 95% CI: 1.247-4.954, respectively). CONCLUSION: Responders diagnosed by a specialist with psychiatric disorders or current insomnia had a higher chance of using DSs. Thus, healthcare providers must provide evidence-based information regarding DSs for mental health improvement and encourage the public to consult healthcare professionals before self-medicating for mental health problems.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alateeq D ; Alsubaie MA ; Alsafi FA ; Alsulaiman SH ; Korayem GB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsps.2022.03.017 ","Keywords":"Anxiety\r\nCI, confidence level\r\nDS, dietary supplements\r\nDepression\r\nDietary supplements\r\nGAD-7, generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire\r\nIRB, institutional review board\r\nISI, insomnia severity index\r\nOR, odds ratio\r\nPHQ-9, patient health questionnaire\r\nPNU, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University\r\nSA, Saudi Arabia\r\nSD, standard deviation\r\nSleep","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alateeq D, Alsubaie MA, Alsafi FA, Alsulaiman SH, and Korayem GB (2022) The use of dietary supplements for mental health among the Saudi population: A cross-sectional survey..

The effect of vitamin D supplementation on treatment of depression in older adults was investigated in this clinical trial. METHODS: It was an 8-week, randomized clinical trial of vitamin D supplementation and placebo in the treatment of depression in 3 psychiatric clinics. The study sample included 78 older adults aged over 60 years with moderate to severe depression. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive 50,000 U vitamin D3 pearl weekly for 8 weeks or placebo (39 subjects in each group). Main outcome measures comprised Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15) questionnaire and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3]. The analysis utilized Mann Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed ranks test, chi-square and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: The mean baseline 25(OH)D3 concentration was 22.57 ± 6.2 ng/ml in vitamin D group and 21.2 ± 5.8 ng/ml in placebo group (p = 0.16). The Vitamin D increased to 43.48 ± 9.5 ng/ml in vitamin D and 25.9 ± 15.3 ng/ml in placebo group. The depression score decreased from 9.25 to 7.48 in vitamin D group (p = 0.0001), while there was a non-significant increase in depression score in placebo group. The multiple regression analysis showed that the vitamin D group and the score of depression before study were the variables that could explain 81.8% of depression score after intervention. CONCLUSION: The findings indicated that vitamin D supplementation can improve the depression score in persons aged 60 and over.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alavi NM ; Khademalhoseini S ; Vakili Z ; Assarian F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.clnu.2018.09.011 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIran\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nVitamin D/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/drug therapy\r\nDepression\r\nElderly\r\nSupplements\r\nVitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alavi NM, Khademalhoseini S, Vakili Z, and Assarian F (2019) Effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression in elderly patients: A randomized clinical trial..

Since December 2019, a pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has swept the globe. To contain the spread of COVID-19, immediate measures such as quarantine and isolation were implemented. These containment measures have contributed to exacerbate situations of anxiety and stress, especially in pregnant women, who are already particularly anxious about their condition. Alterations in the psychological state of pregnant women are related to alterations in the immune system, which is more vulnerable under stress. COVID-19 could therefore find fertile soil in these individuals and risk more severe forms. Normally a controlled dietary regimen is followed during pregnancy, but the use of particular vitamins and micronutrients can help counteract depressive-anxiety states and stress, can improve the immune system, and provide an additional weapon in the defense against COVID-19 to bring the pregnancy to fruition. This review aims to gather data on the impact of COVID-19 on the immune system and psychological condition of pregnant women and to assess whether some micronutrients can improve their psychophysical symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alesci A ; Pergolizzi S ; Fumia A ; Miller A ; Cernigliaro C ; Zaccone M ; Salamone V ; Mastrantonio E ; Gangemi S ; Pioggia G ; Cicero N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu14122534 ","Keywords":"Anxiety/psychology\r\n*COVID-19/epidemiology\r\nDepression/diagnosis/epidemiology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nImmune System\r\nMicronutrients\r\n*Pandemics\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnant Women/psychology\r\nSARS-CoV-2\r\nStress, Psychological/psychology\r\nCOVID-19\r\nimmune system\r\nmicronutrients\r\npregnancy\r\nstress\r\nvitamins","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alesci A, Pergolizzi S, Fumia A, Miller A, Cernigliaro C, Zaccone M, Salamone V, Mastrantonio E, Gangemi S, Pioggia G, and Cicero N (2022) Immune System and Psychological State of Pregnant Women during COVID-19 Pandemic: Are Micronutrients Able to Support Pregnancy?.

One of the recommended treatment strategies in the international evidence-based guidelines is lifestyle modification, which includes diet and exercise, with the aim of improving a range of health outcomes. The incurable nature of PCOS reinforces the importance of developing novel and innovative symptomatic relief strategies, which are currently the only available approaches for improving quality of life for these women. Women with PCOS tend to be nutrient deficient in many common vitamins and minerals, thought to be associated with the psychological (depression, anxiety, etc.) and physiological (insulin resistance, diabetes, infertility, etc.) sequelae of the condition. Nutrient supplementation and the integration of complementary medicine as adjuncts to traditional lifestyle-based therapies in PCOS could therefore provide additional benefits to these women. In this review, we synthesize the evidence regarding nutrient supplementation and complementary therapies in PCOS, predominantly from randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, to provide an overview of the state of knowledge in this field. The evidence to date suggests that specific vitamins (B-12, inositols, folate, vitamins D, E, and K), vitamin-like nutrients (bioflavonoids and α-lipoic acid), minerals (calcium, zinc, selenium, and chromium picolinate), and other formulations (melatonin, ω-3 fatty acids, probiotics, and cinnamon), as well as some complementary approaches such as acupuncture and yoga may be beneficial in PCOS. However, there remain areas of uncertainty and key limitations in the literature that must be overcome before these therapies can be integrated into routine clinical practice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alesi S ; Ee C ; Moran LJ ; Rao V ; Mousa A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/advances/nmab141 ","Keywords":"*Complementary Therapies\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\n*Polycystic Ovary Syndrome/complications/drug therapy\r\nQuality of Life\r\nVitamins/therapeutic use\r\nPCOS\r\ncomplementary medicine\r\ndiet\r\nminerals\r\nnutraceutical\r\nnutrition\r\npolycystic ovary syndrome\r\nreview\r\nsupplementation\r\nvitamins","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alesi S, Ee C, Moran LJ, Rao V, and Mousa A (2022) Nutritional Supplements and Complementary Therapies in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome..

Low vitamin D (25-OH D) levels have been hypothesized to contribute to the pathophysiology of MDD. To investigate the therapeutic role of vitamin D in MDD, we recruited 62 male and female patients diagnosed with MDD and randomized them into two groups: the first group (49 patients) received vitamin D supplementation as cholecalciferol vitamin D(3) (50,000 I.U.) for 3 months, in addition to standard of care (SOC) which included pharmacological treatment and psychological support, and the second group (13 patients) received only SOC without vitamin D supplementation for 3 months. The Beck depression inventory (BDI) scale was used to assess the severity of MDD symptoms. Immunoassays were utilized to determine levels of serum vitamin D(3) and serotonin in all patients. The results showed significant gender differences; female patients showed the most improvement in their depressive symptoms after 3-month vitamin D supplementation. Females with moderate, severe, and extreme depression had significantly lower BDI scores after vitamin D treatment (p < 0.05). Among males, only those diagnosed with severe depression showed significant improvement in their BDI scores (p < 0.05). Serum serotonin levels were significantly increased after vitamin D supplementation compared to baseline in both male and female patients. No significant changes in other biochemical parameters were detected between the two groups. These findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation may ameliorate symptoms of MDD, particularly in females, via a serotonin-dependent mechanism.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alghamdi S ; Alsulami N ; Khoja S ; Alsufiani H ; Tayeb HO ; Tarazi FI ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s12031-019-01461-2 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nCase-Control Studies\r\nCholecalciferol/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nCombined Modality Therapy/methods\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychotherapy/*methods\r\nVitamins/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressant drugs\r\nBeck depression inventory (BDI)\r\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD)\r\nSerotonin\r\nVitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alghamdi S, Alsulami N, Khoja S, Alsufiani H, Tayeb HO, and Tarazi FI (2020) Vitamin D Supplementation Ameliorates Severity of Major Depressive Disorder..

Further, the effect of the addition of FA to LTG therapy was also investigated. The increasing current electroshock seizure test was used to evaluate the anticonvulsant effect of drugs, while the forced swimming test (FST) and spontaneous alternation behaviour (SAB) models were employed for assessing the effects on mood and memory, respectively. LTG exhibited a dose-dependent increase in seizure threshold, whereas FA did not have any effect. LTG did not affect, whereas FA decreased, behavioural depression in the FST in mice. Neither LTG nor FA affected memory scores in the SAB test. The combination of LTG and FA significantly reduced depression while enhancing the effects on memory and seizure threshold. The present observations have confirmed the antiepileptic action of LTG in yet another rodent model of epilepsy. Further, the results clearly demonstrate the additional benefits on epilepsy, mood and memory brought about by the inclusion of FA in the LTG regimen.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ali A ; Pillai KK ; Pal SN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1211/002235702757 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnticonvulsants/*therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nElectroshock\r\nEpilepsy/*drug therapy\r\nFolic Acid/*therapeutic use\r\nLamotrigine\r\nMale\r\nMaze Learning/physiology\r\nMice\r\nSwimming/psychology\r\nTriazines/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ali A, Pillai KK, and Pal SN (2003) Effects of folic acid and lamotrigine therapy in some rodent models of epilepsy and behaviour..

Vitamin D supplements are a potentially important public health intervention, but the response to supplementation varies between individuals. AIM: We aimed to assess the association between several neuropsychological parameters and the magnitude of response to vitamin D supplementation using an artificial neural network method. METHODS: Neuropsychological function was assessed in 619 participants using standard questionnaires. The study participants received vitamin D capsules containing 50,000 IU vitamin D per week over 9 weeks. To assess the relationship between responsiveness to vitamin D supplements and the impact on these neuropsychological parameters, the best-performing artificial neural network algorithms were selected from a combination of different transfer functions in hidden and output layers and variable numbers of hidden layers (between two and 50). The performance of the artificial neural network algorithm was assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis and variables of importance were identified. RESULTS: The artificial neural network algorithm with sigmoid transfer function in both hidden and output layers could predict responsiveness to vitamin D supplementation effectively. The sensitivity and specificity were between 0.60 and 0.70 and 0.66 and 0.70, respectively. Cognitive abilities (42.5%), basal vitamin D (21.3%), body mass index (9.5%), and daytime sleepiness (8%) are the most widely used variables to predict changes in serum vitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive abilities status and baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D are important novel modifiers of the enhancement in circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D after vitamin D supplementation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Allahyari E ; Hanachi P ; Ariakia F ; Kashfi TE ; Ferns GA ; Bahrami A ; Mobarhan MG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0260106020937190 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nBody Mass Index\r\nChild\r\nCognition/*drug effects\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nNeural Networks, Computer\r\nNeuropsychological Tests\r\nROC Curve\r\nSleepiness\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nVitamin D/*administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/blood\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/drug therapy\r\nVitamins/*administration & dosage\r\nYoung Adult\r\nCognitive abilities\r\nartificial intelligence\r\ndepression\r\ninsomnia\r\nsleep disorders\r\nsleepiness","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Allahyari E, Hanachi P, Ariakia F, Kashfi TE, Ferns GA, Bahrami A, and Mobarhan MG (2020) The relationship between neuropsychological function and responsiveness to vitamin D supplementation using artificial neural networks..

It is unclear if treatment with B-vitamins can reduce the long-term prevalence of depression in people at risk, such as stroke survivors. The purpose of this research was to determine if treatment with B-vitamins reduces the hazard of poststroke depression compared with placebo. METHODS: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of tHcy-lowering treatment with daily folic acid (2 mg), vitamin B6 (25 mg), and vitamin B12 (0.5 mg) for 1 to 10.5 years in survivors of stroke. The primary endpoint was the onset of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) major depression after randomization. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of DSM-IV major or minor depression at the end of treatment. Other measured factors included age, gender, poststroke handicap associated with stroke, recurrence of strokes, cognitive impairment, and use of antidepressants. RESULTS: Among 273 people who completed the final assessment after 7.1 ± 2.1 years (mean ± standard deviation) of follow up, random assignment to B-vitamins was associated with a lower hazard of major depression compared with placebo (18.4% vs 23.3%, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.31-0.76) and a trend toward a lower odds of major or minor depression at the end of the trial compared with placebo (19.1% vs 27.7%; adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.58; 95%CI = 0.31-1.09). INTERPRETATION: Long-term treatment of poststroke survivors with folic acid, B6, and B12 was associated with a reduction in the hazard of major depression in our patient population. If these findings can be validated externally, B-vitamin supplementation offers hope as an effective, safe, and affordable intervention to reduce the burden of poststroke depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Almeida OP ; Marsh K ; Alfonso H ; Flicker L ; Davis TM ; Hankey GJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/ana.22189 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nConfidence Intervals\r\nDepression/blood/*diet therapy/*etiology\r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOdds Ratio\r\nProportional Hazards Models\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nStroke/*complications/diet therapy\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin B Complex/blood/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Almeida OP, Marsh K, Alfonso H, Flicker L, Davis TM, and Hankey GJ (2010) B-vitamins reduce the long-term risk of depression after stroke: The VITATOPS-DEP trial..

High plasma homocysteine has been consistently associated with depression, and treatment with certain B vitamins demonstrably reduces its concentration. AIMS: To determine whether vitamins B6, B12 and folic acid enhance response to antidepressant treatment over 52 weeks. METHOD: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of citalopram (20-40 g) together with 0.5 mg of vitamin B12, 2 mg of folic acid and 25 mg of vitamin B6 for 52 weeks (Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: 12609000256279). Participants were community-dwelling adults aged 50 years or over with DSM-IV-TR major depression. We measured severity of symptoms with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The primary outcome was remission of the depressive episode after 12, 26 and 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included reduction of MADRS scores over time and relapse of major depression after recovery by week 12. Results In total, 153 people were randomised (76 placebo, 77 vitamins). Remission of symptoms was achieved by 78.1 and 79.4% of participants treated with placebo and vitamins by week 12 (P = 0.840), by 76.5 and 85.3% at week 26 and 75.8 and 85.5% at week 52 (effect of intervention over 52 weeks: odds ratio (OR) = 2.49, 95% CI 1.12-5.51). Group differences in MADRS scores over time were not significant (P = 0.739). The risk of subsequent relapse among those who had achieved remission of symptoms at week 12 was lower in the vitamins than placebo group (OR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.12-0.94). CONCLUSIONS: B vitamins did not increase the 12-week efficacy of antidepressant treatment, but enhanced and sustained antidepressant response over 1 year. Replication of these findings would mandate that treatment guidelines adopt the adjunctive use of B vitamins as a safe and inexpensive strategy to manage major depression in middle-aged and older adults.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Almeida OP ; Ford AH ; Hirani V ; Singh V ; vanBockxmeer FM ; McCaul K ; Flicker L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1192/bjp.bp.114.145177 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage\r\nCitalopram/*administration & dosage\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy\r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\r\nDrug Monitoring\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/*administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nRemission Induction/methods\r\nSecondary Prevention/methods\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin B 12/*administration & dosage\r\nVitamin B 6/*administration & dosage\r\nVitamins/administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Almeida OP, Ford AH, Hirani V, Singh V, vanBockxmeer FM, McCaul K, and Flicker L (2014) B vitamins to enhance treatment response to antidepressants in middle-aged and older adults: results from the B-VITAGE randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial..

METHODS: This systematic review searched the PubMed, PsychInfo, Embase, and Cochrane databases from inception to 6 June 2014, using the following terms and strategy: (vitamin B12 or vitamin B9 or folate or folic acid or cobalamin or cyanocobalamin) and (depression or depressive disorder or depressive symptoms) and (randomized controlled trial or RCT). The electronic search was supplemented by manual search. Two independent reviewers assessed all papers retrieved for eligibility and bias, and extracted crude data. Review Manager 5 was used to manage and analyze the data. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-nine manuscripts were identified, of which 52 were RCTs and 11 fulfilled criteria for review. We found that the short-term use of vitamins (days to a few weeks) does not contribute to improve depressive symptoms in adults with major depression treated with antidepressants (5 studies, standardized mean difference = -0.12, 95% confidence interval--95% CI = -0.45, 0.22), but more prolonged consumption (several weeks to years) may decrease the risk of relapse (1 study, odds ratio (OR) = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.12, 0.94) and the onset of clinically significant symptoms in people at risk (2 studies, risk ratio = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.43, 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: The number of available trials remains small and heterogeneity between studies high. The results of these meta-analyses suggest that treatment with folate and vitamin B12 does not decrease the severity of depressive symptoms over a short period of time, but may be helpful in the long-term management of special populations.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Almeida OP ; Ford AH ; Flicker L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S1041610215000046 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nFolic Acid/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nVitamin B 12/*therapeutic use\r\nrandomized controlled trial","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Almeida OP, Ford AH, and Flicker L (2015) Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials of folate and vitamin B12 for depression..

Folate supplementation in MDD has been studied in other settings with promising results. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of methylfolate as an adjunctive treatment among adults with MDD and inadequate response to an SSRI. Twenty-two adults (59% female; mean age 45.2 +/- 11.0 years) with DSM-IV MDD, partial or nonresponse to an SSRI after at least 4 weeks of treatment, and a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) score > or = 12 were enrolled in this 8-week prospective open trial. Exclusion criteria included current use of anticonvulsants or psychotropics other than an SSRI, or B12 deficiency. Leucovorin (folinic acid), which is metabolized to methylfolate, was added to SSRIs at 15-30 mg/day. Folate levels rose from 28 +/- 19 ng/mL to 301 +/- 203 ng/mL (p < 0.001). HAM-D-17 scores among the 16 completers decreased from 19.1 +/- 3.9 to 12.8 +/- 7.0 (p < 0.01). However only 31% of completers and 27% of the intent-to-treat (ITT) sample achieved response (> or = 50% reduction in HAM-D-17 scores), and only 19% of completers and 18% of the ITT sample achieved remission (HAM-D-17 < or = 7). Leucovorin appears to be modestly effective as an adjunct among SSRI-refractory depressed individuals with normal folate levels. The application of leucovorin as an adjunct in the setting of refractory depression deserves further study.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alpert JE ; Mischoulon D ; Rubenstein GE ; Bottonari K ; Nierenberg AA ; Fava M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1023/a:1015271927517 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLeucovorin/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSerotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alpert JE, Mischoulon D, Rubenstein GE, Bottonari K, Nierenberg AA, and Fava M (2002) Folinic acid (Leucovorin) as an adjunctive treatment for SSRI-refractory depression..

Higher FOL levels at baseline predicted greater improvement. Further study of FOL interaction with SSRI is warranted.

The clinical management of this condition is frequently based on the use of some pharmacological antidepressant agents, together with psychotherapy and other alternatives in most severe cases. However, an important percentage of depressed patients fail to respond to the use of conventional therapies. This has created the urgency of finding novel approaches to help in the clinical management of those individuals. Nutraceuticals are natural compounds contained in food with proven benefits either in health promotion or disease prevention and therapy. A growing interest and economical sources are being placed in the development and understanding of multiple nutraceutical products. Here, we summarize some of the most relevant nutraceutical agents evaluated in preclinical and clinical models of depression. In addition, we will also explore less frequent but interest nutraceutical products which are starting to be tested, also evaluating future roads to cover in order to maximize the benefits of nutraceuticals in MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alvarez-Mon MA ; Ortega MA ; García-Montero C ; Fraile-Martinez O ; Monserrat J ; Lahera G ; Mora F ; Rodriguez-Quiroga A ; Fernandez-Rojo S ; Quintero J ; Alvarez-Mon M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ph14080821 ","Keywords":"S-Adenosyl-methionine (SAMe)\r\nbioactive compounds\r\nmajor depressive disorder (MDD)\r\nmethylfolate\r\nmicronutrients\r\nnutraceuticals\r\nomega 3 fatty acids\r\npre/probiotics\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alvarez-Mon MA, Ortega MA, García-Montero C, Fraile-Martinez O, Monserrat J, Lahera G, Mora F, Rodriguez-Quiroga A, Fernandez-Rojo S, Quintero J, and Alvarez-Mon M (2021) Exploring the Role of Nutraceuticals in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): Rationale, State of the Art and Future Prospects..

Currently available treatment options can have substantial side effects and take weeks to be fully effective. Therefore, it is important to find safe alternatives, which act more rapidly and in a larger number of patients. While much research on MDD focuses on chronic stress as a main risk factor, we here make a point of exploring dietary factors as a somewhat overlooked, yet highly promising approach towards novel antidepressant pathways. Deficiencies in various groups of nutrients often occur in patients with mental disorders. These include vitamins, especially members of the B-complex (B6, B9, B12). Moreover, an imbalance of fatty acids, such as omega-3 and omega-6, or an insufficient supply with minerals, including magnesium and zinc, are related to MDD. While some of them are relevant for the synthesis of monoamines, others play a crucial role in inflammation, neuroprotection and the synthesis of growth factors. Evidence suggests that when deficiencies return to normal, changes in mood and behavior can be, at least in some cases, achieved. Furthermore, supplementation with dietary factors (so called \"nutraceuticals\") may improve MDD symptoms even in the absence of a deficiency. Non-vital dietary factors may affect MDD symptoms as well. For instance, the most commonly consumed psychostimulant caffeine may improve behavioral and molecular markers of MDD. The molecular structure of most dietary factors is well known. Hence, dietary factors may provide important molecular tools to study and potentially help treat MDD symptoms. Within this review, we will discuss the role of dietary factors in MDD risk and symptomology, and critically discuss how they might serve as auxiliary treatments or preventative options for MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aly J ; Engmann O ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fnins.2020.582853 ","Keywords":"antidepressants\r\ncaffeine\r\ndietary factors\r\nfatty acids\r\nmajor depressive disorder\r\nminerals\r\nvitamins","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aly J, and Engmann O (2020) The Way to a Human's Brain Goes Through Their Stomach: Dietary Factors in Major Depressive Disorder..

This study was designed to determine the effect of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on the severity of symptoms and some related inflammatory biomarkers in women with PPD.Materials and Methods: Eighty-one women with a PPD score >12 participated in this study. A total of 27 patients were randomly assigned into three groups (1:1:1 ratio) to receive either 50,000 IU vitamin D3 fortnightly + 500 mg calcium carbonate daily; or 50,000 IU vitamin D3 fortnightly + placebo of calcium carbonate daily, or placebo of vitamin D3 fortnightly + placebo of calcium carbonate daily (placebo group) for 8 weeks. At the baseline and end of the study, the severity score of PPD, levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D, calcium, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), interleukin 6 (IL6) and estradiol were measured.Results: The PPD score had more reduction in the vitamin D + calcium and vitamin D + calcium placebo groups than that of the placebo group (-1.7 ± 3.44, -4.16 ± 5.90 and 0.25 ± 2.81, respectively; p = 0.008). The effect of vitamin D on the PPD score was larger when vitamin D was given alone than given together with calcium (p = 0.042 and p = 0.004, respectively). No significant differences in estradiol, IL6 and TNFα were observed between the three groups.Discussion: Vitamin D may be effective in improving the clinical symptoms of PPD; however, the mechanism of the effect might not entirely operate through inflammatory and/or hormonal changes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Amini S ; Amani R ; Jafarirad S ; Cheraghian B ; Sayyah M ; Hemmati AA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/1028415X.2019.1707396 ","Keywords":"Biomarkers/*blood\r\nCalcium/*administration & dosage/blood\r\nDepression, Postpartum/blood/*drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nEstradiol/*blood\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInflammation/*blood\r\nInterleukin-6/blood\r\nTumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/blood\r\nVitamin D/*administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/blood\r\nVitamin D\r\ndepression\r\nestradiol\r\nhigh sensitive C-reactive protein\r\ninflammatory mediators\r\ninterleukin 6\r\npostpartum\r\ntumor necrosis factor-alpha","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Amini S, Amani R, Jafarirad S, Cheraghian B, Sayyah M, and Hemmati AA (2022) The effect of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on inflammatory biomarkers, estradiol levels and severity of symptoms in women with postpartum depression: a randomized double-blind clinical trial..

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of vitamin C as an adjuvant agent in the treatment of pediatric major depressive disorder in a six-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial. METHODS: The study group (n=12) was given fluoxetine (10-20 mg/day) plus vitamin C (1000 mg/day) and control group (n=12) administered fluoxetine (10-20 mg/day) plus placebo. The data were analyzed by ANOVA and t-test for independent samples. RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated significantly improved scores on the Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS), the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). ANOVA was significantly different on all clinical measurements (group effect, time effect, and interaction), with the exception of group effect and interaction for CGI. Patients treated for six months with fluoxetine and vitamin C showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms in comparison to the fluoxetine plus placebo group as measured by the CDRS (t=11.36, P<0.0001) and CDI (t=12.27, P<0.0001), but not CGI (t=0.13, P=0.90). No serious adverse effects were observed.

The essence of the association of O&NS pathways with autoimmune responses in depression is via damage to lipid membranes, anchorage molecules and functional proteins that lead to changes in their chemical structures creating new modified epitopes (neoepitopes), which are highly immunogenic. The abovementioned pathways together with decreased antioxidant levels, including zinc, coenzyme Q10, glutathione and vitamin E, and melatonin are intimately involved in different aspects of depression, including mitochondrial functions and the regulation of cAMP / circadian genes, allowing for impacts across different aspects of symptom patterning. Immuno- inflammatory and O&NS processes may additionally cause alterations in blood-brain barrier permeability and neuroprogression, that is tissue damage, including neurodegeneration and apoptosis, and decreased neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. Activation of those interconnected pathways is relevant to the pathophysiology of acute and chronic depression and the progressive course (staging) of clinical depression. This implies that compounds that target these pathways may be useful to treat acute episodes and prevent further progression of the disease. We herein review some promising compounds, such as melatonin, melatonin receptor agonists, allopregnanolone, PDE4 inhibitors, statins, aspirin, sodium benzoate, tryptophan-enriched diets, and antioxidants, including epigallocatechin gallate, curcumin, quercitin, alpha-lipoic acid and resveratrol.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Anderson G ; Maes M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/13816128113196660738 ","Keywords":"Adaptive Immunity/drug effects\r\nAnimals\r\nAntioxidants/metabolism\r\nApoptosis/drug effects\r\n*Autoimmunity/drug effects\r\n*Depression/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nImmunity, Cellular/drug effects\r\nNeurons/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology\r\nNitrogen/*metabolism\r\n*Oxidative Stress/drug effects/immunology\r\nReactive Nitrogen Species/metabolism\r\nReactive Oxygen Species/metabolism\r\nTryptophan/*metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Anderson G, and Maes M (2014) Oxidative/nitrosative stress and immuno-inflammatory pathways in depression: treatment implications..

The benefits of vitamin D intake to treat or prevent cognitive impairment remain unknown. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether weekly dietary intake of vitamin D could be associated with global cognitive performance among older adults. METHODS: A total of 5,596 community-dwelling women (mean age 80.5 ± 0.1 years) free of vitamin D drug supplements from the Epidémiologie de l'Ostéoporose (EPIDOS) study were divided into 2 groups according to baseline weekly vitamin D dietary intake (either inadequate <35 μg/wk or recommended ≥35μg/wk). Weekly vitamin D dietary intakes were estimated from a self-administered food frequency questionnaire. Cognitive impairment was defined as a Pfeiffer Short Portable Mental State Questionnaire (SPMSQ) score <8. Age, body mass index, sun exposure at midday, season, disability, number of chronic diseases, hypertension, depression, use of psychoactive drugs, and education level were considered as potential confounders. RESULTS: Compared to women with recommended weekly vitamin D dietary intakes (n = 4,802; mean age 80.4 ± 3.8 years), women with inadequate intakes (n = 794; mean age 81.0 ± 3.8 years) had a lower mean SPMSQ score (p < 0.001) and more often had an SPMSQ score <8 (p = 0.002). We found an association between weekly vitamin D dietary intake and SPMSQ score (β = 0.002, p < 0.001).

The relationship between vitamin D intakes and cognitive decline is not well understood. Our objective was to determine whether the dietary intake of vitamin D was an independent predictor of the onset of dementia within 7 years among women aged 75 years and older. METHODS: Four hundred and ninety-eight community-dwelling women (mean, 79.8 ± 3.8 years) free of vitamin D supplements from the EPIDemiology of OSteoporosis Toulouse cohort study were divided into three groups according to the onset of dementia within 7 years (ie, no dementia, Alzheimer's disease [AD], or other dementias). Baseline vitamin D dietary intakes were estimated from self-administered food frequency questionnaire. Age, body mass index, initial cognitive performance, education level, physical activity, sun exposure, disability, number of chronic diseases, hypertension, depression, use of psychoactive drugs, and baseline season were considered as potential confounders. RESULTS: Women who developed AD (n = 70) had lower baseline vitamin D intakes (mean, 50.3 ± 19.3 μg/wk) than nondemented (n = 361; mean intake = 59.0 ± 29.9 μg/wk, p = .027) or those who developed other dementias (n = 67; mean intake = 63.6 ± 38.1 μg/wk, p = .010). There was no difference between other dementias and no dementia (p = .247). Baseline vitamin D dietary intakes were associated with the onset of AD (adjusted odds ratio = 0.99 [95% confidence interval = 0.98-0.99], p = .041) but not with other dementias (p = .071). Being in the highest quintile of vitamin D dietary intakes was associated with a lower risk of AD compared with the lower 4 quintiles combined (adjusted odds ratio = 0.23 [95% confidence interval = 0.08-0.67], p = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Higher vitamin D dietary intake was associated with a lower risk of developing AD among older women.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Annweiler C ; Rolland Y ; Schott AM ; Blain H ; Vellas B ; Herrmann FR ; Beauchet O ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/gerona/gls107 ","Keywords":"Age Distribution\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAlzheimer Disease/*epidemiology/prevention & control\r\nAnthropometry\r\nBody Mass Index\r\nChi-Square Distribution\r\nCognition Disorders/*epidemiology/prevention & control\r\nCohort Studies\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nIncidence\r\nLogistic Models\r\nNeuropsychological Tests\r\nProspective Studies\r\nRisk Assessment\r\nTime Factors\r\nVitamin D/*administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Annweiler C, Rolland Y, Schott AM, Blain H, Vellas B, Herrmann FR, and Beauchet O (2012) Higher vitamin D dietary intake is associated with lower risk of alzheimer's disease: a 7-year follow-up..

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a parallel-group, randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effect of the DASH diet on these health outcomes in women with migraine. Of 102 eligible women (20-50 years), fifty one randomised to the DASH and fifty one to the usual dietary advice (control) groups completed a 12-week intervention. The DASH diet was designed using a 7-d menu cycle to provide 15-20 % of total daily energy requirements from proteins, 25-30 % from fats and 55-60 % from carbohydrates. Dietary records and serum vitamin C levels were used to assess women's compliance with the DASH diet. The clinical symptoms of migraine (i.e., frequency, duration and severity) and quality of life and mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety and stress) outcomes were assessed in groups pre-and post-intervention. We observed greater decreases in the frequency (-3·00 v. -1·40, P = 0·025) and severity (-1·76 v. -0·59, P < 0·001) of migraine in the DASH v. control group post-intervention. Similarly, the DASH group exhibited a tendency towards greater decreases in migraine duration (-0·58 v. -0·33 d, P = 0·053) and had lower scores of depression (-4·50 v. -2·73, P = 0·019) and stress (-5·84 v. -2·98, P = 0·011) v. controls. However, the quality of life and anxiety outcomes remained comparable in groups post-intervention. Together, evidence supports the benefits of the DASH diet on improving migraine health outcomes in reproductive-aged women. Further research is needed to confirm our findings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Arab A ; Khorvash F ; Kazemi M ; Heidari Z ; Askari G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S000711452100444X ","Keywords":"Clinical symptoms\r\nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\r\nMigraine\r\nNutrition\r\nQuality of life","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Arab A, Khorvash F, Kazemi M, Heidari Z, and Askari G (2021) Effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on clinical, quality of life and mental health outcomes in women with migraine: a randomised controlled trial..

Vitamin D, owing to its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, developmental roles, and regulating calcium homeostasis, is predicted to have a significant influence on maternal and fetal health status. Several observational studies and clinical trials, determining the impact of vitamin D on gestational diabetes, C-section, postpartum depression, pre-eclampsia, miscarriages, and preterm delivery, have been elaborated in this review. In addition, fetal birth defects including neurological development, reduced birth weight, respiratory infections, bone development, and altered anthropometrics have also been summarized with available evidences. Other important mechanisms related to the roles of vitamin D in the body are also explained. Furthermore, recent studies determining the effect of vitamin D at genetic level will also help in understanding and future design of research in the area of maternal and fetal health.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Arshad R ; Sameen A ; Murtaza MA ; Sharif HR ; Iahtisham-Ul-Haq  ; Dawood S ; Ahmed Z ; Nemat A ; Manzoor MF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/fsn3.2948 ","Keywords":"birth defects\r\ncalcitriol\r\nfetal growth\r\nmaternal health\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Arshad R, Sameen A, Murtaza MA, Sharif HR, Iahtisham-Ul-Haq , Dawood S, Ahmed Z, Nemat A, and Manzoor MF (2022) Impact of vitamin D on maternal and fetal health: A review..

Malonaldehyde (MDA) levels were also measured in the adrenal tissues. Anxiety level (0.023), depression level (p=0.042) and MDA values (p=0.01) were significantly increased in the stress group. Histological sections of the stress group showed cortical atrophy, medullary hypertrophy, vascular dilation and hemorrhage. Azan staining revealed a thinned capsule and corticomedullary fibrosis in the stress group. Pathologies induced by immobilization stress were mostly reversed after vitamin E administration.

AIM: The current study investigated the association between dietary intake and seven aspects of cognitive abilities among healthy young women. METHODS: The study was carried out among 182 women aged 18-25 years. A valid and reliable food frequency questionnaire containing 65 food items was used to estimate dietary intake. Neuropsychological function and cognitive abilities of participants were determined using standard questionnaires. RESULTS: Significant differences were found in depression, anxiety, stress, physical, and mental health-related quality of life as well as daytime sleepiness for the participants in different quartiles of cognitive abilities score (p<0.05). Participants in the fourth quartile of cognitive abilities score consumed significantly higher energy, carbohydrate, protein, calcium, iron, zinc, vitamin A, thiamin, and riboflavin compared to those in the lowest quartile (p<0.05). There were strong correlations between total cognitive abilities score and dietary sodium, calcium, phosphorus, and thiamin (p<0.05). Using stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, iron and thiamin were statistically significant factors for the prediction of cognitive abilities. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that neurocognitive function is related to dietary macro and micronutrients including energy, carbohydrate, protein, calcium, iron, zinc, vitamin A, thiamin, and riboflavin on cognitive performance among young women without memory deficit.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Askari M ; Abbaszadeh A ; Saharkhiz M ; Karbasi S ; Talebpour A ; Fashami AAA ; Rezapour H ; Hoseini ZS ; Mahmoudzadeh S ; Ayadilord M ; Ferns GA ; Bahrami A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0260106020940116 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nCognition/*physiology\r\n*Diet\r\nDiet Surveys\r\nEating\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMicronutrients\r\n*Nutrients\r\nQuality of Life\r\nYoung Adult\r\nInsomnia\r\ncognition\r\ndepression\r\niron\r\nthiamin","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Askari M, Abbaszadeh A, Saharkhiz M, Karbasi S, Talebpour A, Fashami AAA, Rezapour H, Hoseini ZS, Mahmoudzadeh S, Ayadilord M, Ferns GA, and Bahrami A (2020) A study of the association between cognitive abilities and dietary intake in young women..

In a subsample of 1864 subjects (809 men and 1055 women) from the French SU.VI.MAX cohort, dietary habits have been measured at the beginning of the follow-up (six 24 h records) and declarations of antidepressant prescription, taken as markers of depressive episodes, have been recorded during the 8-year follow-up. No significant association was observed between folate intake and the risk of any depressive episode or of a single depressive episode during the follow-up, in both men and women. In contrast, the risk of experiencing recurrent depressive episodes (two or more) during the follow-up was strongly reduced in men with high folate intake (OR 0.25 (95 % CI 0.06, 0.98) for the highest tertile v. the lowest, P for trend 0.046).

Diet has been identified as a modifiable risk factor and opportunity for intervention in many physical illnesses and more recently in mental illnesses such as unipolar depression; however, no dietary guidelines exist for patients with SSD. OBJECTIVE: This review sought to systematically scope the existing literature in order to identify nutritional interventions for the prevention or treatment of mental health symptoms in SSD as well as gaps and opportunities for further research. METHODS: This review followed established methodological approaches for scoping reviews including an extensive a priori search strategy and duplicate screening. Because of the large volume of results, an online program (Abstrackr) was used for screening and tagging. Data were extracted based on the dietary constituents and analyzed. RESULTS: Of 55,330 results identified by the search, 822 studies met the criteria for inclusion. Observational evidence shows a connection between the presence of psychotic disorders and poorer quality dietary patterns, higher intake of refined carbohydrates and total fat, and lower intake or levels of fibre, ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids, vegetables, fruit, and certain vitamins and minerals (vitamin B12 and B6, folate, vitamin C, zinc, and selenium). Evidence illustrates a role of food allergy and sensitivity as well as microbiome composition and specific phytonutrients (such as L-theanine, sulforaphane, and resveratrol). Experimental studies have demonstrated benefit using healthy diet patterns and specific vitamins and minerals (vitamin B12 and B6, folate, and zinc) and amino acids (serine, lysine, glycine, and tryptophan). DISCUSSION: Overall, these findings were consistent with many other bodies of knowledge about healthy dietary patterns. Many limitations exist related to the design of the individual studies and the ability to extrapolate the results of studies using dietary supplements to dietary interventions (food). Dietary recommendations are presented as well as recommendations for further research including more prospective observational studies and intervention studies that modify diet constituents or entire dietary patterns with statistical power to detect mental health outcomes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aucoin M ; LaChance L ; Cooley K ; Kidd S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000493399 ","Keywords":"*Diet\r\nHumans\r\n*Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\n*Psychotic Disorders/diet therapy/etiology/prevention & control\r\n*Schizophrenia/diet therapy/etiology/prevention & control\r\nDietary constituents\r\nMental health\r\nNutritional guidelines\r\nSchizophrenia spectrum disorders","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aucoin M, LaChance L, Cooley K, and Kidd S (2020) Diet and Psychosis: A Scoping Review..

Vit D regulator acts via a Vit D receptor (VDR). WAG/Rij rats have a genetically epileptic model of absence epilepsy with comorbidity of depression. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Vit D and paricalcitol (PRC) on WAG/Rij rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-three male WAG/Rij rats and seven male Wistar rats were used. The effects of acute and chronic treatment with Vit D (5.000 and 60.000 IU/kg, i.p) and PRC (0.5, 5 and 10 μg/kg, i.p) on absence seizures, and related psychiatric comorbidity were investigated in WAG/Rij rats. Depression-like behavior was assayed by using the forced swimming test (FST) and; anxiety-like behavior by using the open field test (OFT). RESULTS: Acute Vit D treatments (5.000 and 60.000 IU/kg) similarly reduced the number and duration of spike-wave discharges (SWDs) and showed anxiolytic-antidepressive effect whereas there were no significant changes in other measured parameters between the daily and the bolus dose of Vit D. Acute administration of PRC (0.5, 5 and 10 μg/kg) showed anti-convulsive and anxiolytic-antidepressive effect. The dose (0.5 μg/kg) of PRC was the most effective dose. Chronic treatment was more effective than acute therapy in all parameters. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study demonstrate that Vit D and PRC have antiepileptic and anxiolytic-antidepressive effects on the absence epilepsy in WAG/Rij rats.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aygun H ; Ayyildiz M ; Agar E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2019.106208 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnticonvulsants/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety/drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects/physiology\r\nBrain/*drug effects/physiopathology\r\nDepression/drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nElectrocorticography\r\nEpilepsy, Absence/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nErgocalciferols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSwimming\r\nVitamin D/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAbsence epilepsy\r\nParicalcitol\r\nSeizure\r\nVitamin D\r\nWAG/Rij rat","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aygun H, Ayyildiz M, and Agar E (2019) Effects of vitamin D and paricalcitol on epileptogenesis and behavioral properties of WAG/Rij rats with absence epilepsy..

In this article, we review folate metabolism, its relationship with bipolar disorder, and its therapeutic potential. METHODS: We searched PubMed and the Cochrane Library for relevant articles up to and including the year 2012. Background information, proposed mechanisms of action, and results from clinical trials were reviewed. RESULTS: Folate is an essential cofactor involved in methylation reactions, which are critical for monoamine synthesis and homocysteine regulation. Folate level is thought to be associated with mood disorders and limited response to antidepressants. Functional deficiency, due to a common genetic variant of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (NAD(P)H) (MTHFR) gene, could also affect the presentation of bipolar disorder. Sodium valproate and lamotrigine, commonly used mood stabilizers for the treatment of bipolar disorder, can potentially interfere with folate and homocysteine metabolism. Previous studies consistently support the efficacy of folate in the treatment of depression; one study showed efficacy in the treatment of mania. Biologically active forms of folate formulations, which do not require biochemical conversion, could be beneficial in the treatment of bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Folate augmentation could be effective for the treatment of bipolar disorder. A common genetic variant of the MTHFR gene might impact the treatment effect of folate augmentation. The biologically active form of folate could potentially correct mood stabilizer-associated functional folate deficiency, help normalize monoamine synthesis, and improve outcomes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baek JH ; Bernstein EE ; Nierenberg AA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0004867413502091 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/pharmacology\r\nAntimanic Agents/pharmacology\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism\r\nBrain/drug effects/metabolism\r\nFolic Acid/*metabolism/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nLamotrigine\r\nMethylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/genetics\r\nTriazines/pharmacology\r\nValproic Acid/pharmacology\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nfolate\r\nmood disorder\r\nnutraceuticals","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baek JH, Bernstein EE, and Nierenberg AA (2013) One-carbon metabolism and bipolar disorder..

This study evaluated the effects of vitamin D on mental health symptoms, nicotine misuse, and biomarkers of metabolic diseases in individuals with a tobacco use disorder. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted with 60 CS subjects receiving either 50,000 IU vitamin D supplements (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) every 2 weeks for 24-weeks. Nicotine misuse, mental health scale, and metabolic parameters were measured before and after the intervention in the CS subjects. Compared with the placebo-group, after the 24-weeks intervention, serum 25 (OH) vitamin D levels increased in the intervention group (β 2.96; 95% CI, 0.91, 5.01; P = 0.006). In addition, vitamin D supplementation significantly improved Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (β -2.06; 95% CI, -3.84, -0.28; P = 0.02). In addition, vitamin D administration significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (β -4.56; 95% CI, -8.94, -0.19; P = 0.04), insulin (β -0.50; 95% CI, -0.88, -0.13; P = 0.009), and homeostasis model of assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) levels (β -0.21; 95% CI, -0.33, -0.08; P = 0.001). Furthermore, vitamin D resulted in a significant elevation in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (β 81.20; 95% CI, 18.30, 144.11; P = 0.01), and plasma glutathione (GSH) levels (β 73.05; 95% CI, 18.56, 127.54; P = 0.01), compared with the placebo-group. Administration of vitamin D for 24-weeks to CS subjects had beneficial effects on symptoms of depression and several metabolic biomarkers. While this preliminary study suggests that vitamin D might have beneficial effects, its clinical efficacy in individuals with a tobacco use disorder should be further validated in future clinical trials.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bagheri S ; Saghazade AR ; Abbaszadeh-Mashkani S ; Banafshe HR ; Ghoreishi FS ; Mesdaghinia A ; Ghaderi A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/10550887.2021.2010971 ","Keywords":"Biomarkers\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nGlutathione\r\nHumans\r\nNicotine\r\nTobacco\r\n*Tobacco Use Disorder/complications/drug therapy\r\nVitamin D/therapeutic use\r\nVitamin D supplementation\r\ncigarette smokers\r\nmental health\r\nmetabolic biomarkers\r\nnicotine misuse","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bagheri S, Saghazade AR, Abbaszadeh-Mashkani S, Banafshe HR, Ghoreishi FS, Mesdaghinia A, and Ghaderi A (2022) The effect of vitamin D supplementation on tobacco-related disorders in individuals with a tobacco use disorder: a randomized clinical trial..

We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on depression and aggression scores in adolescent girls. Nine hundred forty adolescent girls received vitamin D(3) at a dose of 50,000 IU/week for 9 weeks. Anthropometric parameters and blood pressure were measured using standard protocols at the baseline and at the end of the study. Depression score was evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory-II and aggression was evaluated using the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire at baseline and at the end of the study. Comparison among the four categories of depression score (normal, mild, moderate, and severe) revealed no significant differences in demographic and anthropometric parameters at baseline. After 9 weeks of vitamin D supplementation, there was a significant reduction on mild, moderate, and severe depression score. However, vitamin D supplementation had no significant effect on aggression score.

The importance of dietary factors in the causation of depression is suggested from epidemiologic studies in Western countries, but evidence from non-Western populations are lacking. We aimed to assess the relationship between dietary factors with depression scores in a cohort from north eastern Iran. METHODS: A total of 7172 subjects (2725 men and 4447 women) were recruited. Dietary intake was assessed using a 24-h dietary recall questionnaire, and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck's depression questionnaire. RESULTS: The age of the population samples were 49.3 ± 8.2 years for the male and 48.1 ± 8.0 years for the female subgroups. Crude intake of MUFA, SFA and TFA in patients was associated with depression scores. On the other hand, there were significant correlations between depression score and total energy adjusted intake of trans-fatty acid (TFA), cholesterol, vitamin E (p < 0.01 for all parameters). CONCLUSION: There was an association between diet and depression score among a representative sample of individuals from north eastern Iran, with MUFA intake being inversely related, and vitamin E intake being directly related to Beck's depression score. However it cannot be determined whether this is related to the causation of depression in this cross sectional study.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Banikazemi Z ; Mokhber N ; Safarian M ; Mazidi M ; Mirzaei H ; Esmaily H ; Azarpazhooh MR ; Ghafouri-Taleghani F ; Ghayour-Mobarhan M ; Ferns GA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.clnesp.2014.12.001 ","Keywords":"Depression\r\nDietary intake\r\nMicronutrients","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Banikazemi Z, Mokhber N, Safarian M, Mazidi M, Mirzaei H, Esmaily H, Azarpazhooh MR, Ghafouri-Taleghani F, Ghayour-Mobarhan M, and Ferns GA (2015) Dietary vitamin E and fat intake are related to Beck's depression score..

There was an increase in both the concentration of tryptophan in the brain and the uptake into the brain of peripherally administered [3H]tryptophan, accompanied by a small increase in the rate of synthesis of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the brain. It is suggested that this increase in the uptake of tryptophan into the brain following a relatively large dose of vitamin B6 may explain the beneficial action of the vitamin in some cases of depressive illness.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bender DA ; Totoe L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1471-4159.1984.tb12793.x ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBiological Transport/drug effects\r\nBrain/drug effects/*metabolism\r\nCarbon Radioisotopes\r\nFemale\r\nLiver/drug effects/*metabolism\r\nPyridoxal Phosphate/metabolism\r\nPyridoxine/*pharmacology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Inbred Strains\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nTryptophan/*metabolism/urine\r\nTryptophan Oxygenase/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bender DA, and Totoe L (1984) High doses of vitamin B6 in the rat are associated with inhibition of hepatic tryptophan metabolism and increased uptake of tryptophan into the brain..

We performed a post hoc analysis of a randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind study in which patients with frequent RTIs were randomized to placebo or vitamin D (4000 IE/day for 1 year, n = 124). At the last visit of the study, patients were asked to perform a general assessment of their well-being during the study. RESULTS: The majority of patients, both placebo- and vitamin D treated, stated that they had felt 'better' during the study; 52% in the placebo group and 70% in the vitamin D group, relative risk 1.3 (95% CI 1.0-1.8; p = 0.06, Fisher's exact test). Statement of better well-being was associated with an increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels (p < 0.001). In contrast, worse well-being was associated with unchanged 25-OHD levels. Notably, a 25-OHD level above 100 nmol/L at the study end was associated with a higher chance of having a better well-being (p < 0.01). Four patients on anti-depressive treatment could terminate their antidepressant medication during the study. These patients had a significant increase in 25-OHD levels from low levels at study-start. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation to patients with frequent RTIs might be beneficial, not only for infections, but also for their general well-being. However, given the post hoc design of this study, these findings need to be confirmed in additional clinical trials before firm conclusions can be drawn.

We investigated whether vitamin B6, B12, and folate have an effect on brain structure, especially among depressed people who follow a specific diet. The study sample comprised 9426 participants from the UK Biobank cohort with a mean age of 62.4 years. A generalized linear model controlling for age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, town send deprivation index, educational qualification, smoking, and alcohol intake was used to test the association between study groups and structural brain volumes. Depression was more prevalent, and intake of vitamin B6 and B12 was lower among vegetarians, while non-vegetarians had a lower intake of folate. Overall, no significant association was observed between vitamin B6, B12, and folate intakes and both global and subcortical brain volumes among participants with depression. However, vitamin B12 intake was positively associated with right pallidum among non-depressed participants, and a significant interaction between vitamin B12 intake and depression status on the right pallidum was observed. Also, a significant interaction between folate intake and depression status on grey matter (GM) volume and left thalamus was observed. Upon diet stratification, folate intake is associated with total brain volume and GM volume among vegetarians with depression. Furthermore, no significant associations were observed for subcortical regions. Our findings suggest that dietary intake of vitamin B6 and B12 might have an effect on brain structure. Vegetarians, particularly those who suffer from depression may benefit from supplementing their diets with vitamins B6, B12, and folate to ensure brain health. Further studies, especially with a larger sample size and longitudinal design, are needed to confirm these findings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Berkins S ; Schiöth HB ; Rukh G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu13061790 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nBrain/*anatomy & histology/diagnostic imaging\r\nDepression/*epidemiology\r\nDiet\r\nEating\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/*administration & dosage\r\nFolic Acid Deficiency/epidemiology\r\nGray Matter/diagnostic imaging\r\nHumans\r\nLinear Models\r\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging/methods\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNutritional Status\r\nUnited Kingdom/epidemiology\r\nVegetarians/*statistics & numerical data\r\nVitamin B 12/*administration & dosage\r\nVitamin B 12 Deficiency/epidemiology\r\nVitamin B 6/*administration & dosage\r\nVitamin B 6 Deficiency/epidemiology\r\nbrain structure\r\ndepression\r\nvegetarians\r\nvitamin B12\r\nvitamin B6","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Berkins S, Schiöth HB, and Rukh G (2021) Depression and Vegetarians: Association between Dietary Vitamin B6, B12 and Folate Intake and Global and Subcortical Brain Volumes..

Disturbances in the metabolism of tryptophan have been shown to be responsible for such symptoms as depression, anxiety, decrease of libido and impairment of glucose tolerance occurring in some of the OCA users. Administration of 40 mg of vitamin B6 daily not only restores normal biochemical values but also relieves the clinical symptoms in those vitamin B6 deficient women taking OCA's.

The current difficulty is in trying to isolate the conditions that are most likely to respond. Treating seizures is a major part of a neurologic practice. Our current therapeutic agents are only partially successful and limited by multiple side effects. One problem is that patients often have to take these agents for an entire lifetime, further raising the risk of toxicity. If pyridoxine supplementation can improve the efficacy of currently used medications, it will be gladly accepted into our therapeutic arsenal. Headache, chronic pain, and depression all appear to run together in many of our patients. The observations that serotonin deficiency is a common thread between them and that pyridoxine can raise serotonin levels open a wide range of therapeutic options. Small studies have been carried out with mixed success. Comparison with amitriptyline in the treatment of headache appears to show about equal efficacy, although side effects would be expected to be more of a problem with the amitriptyline. Behavioral disorders are relatively common and continue to be a major problem, disrupting the lives of the patients and their families. Current treatments are not acceptable to most people because of the risk of side effects with long-term usage. If, as Dr. Feingold suggests, many of these problems are caused by \"toxic\" exposures to chemicals that are pyridoxine antagonists, supplementation at early ages may reduce the incidence of hyperactivity and aggressive behavior. This raises the question of safety. Is pyridoxine safe for long-term use in large segments of the population, including children? The studies on children with Down's syndrome and autism, utilizing much higher doses than are used for other therapeutic purposes, seem to indicate relative safety if carefully monitored. Studies involving large population groups with carpal tunnel syndrome, all adults, using 100-150 mg/day have shown minimal or no toxicity in five- to 10-year studies. Women self-medicating for PMS taking 500 to 5000 mg/day have shown peripheral neuropathy within one to three years. It would appear from this retrospective analysis that pyridoxine is safe at doses of 100 mg/day or less in adults. In children there is not enough data to make any sort of suggestion. Because the major neurologic complication is a peripheral neuropathy and the causes of this condition are myriad, pyridoxine may cause neuropathy only in patients with a pre-existing susceptibility to this condition.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bernstein AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1749-6632.1990.tb28058.x ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome/drug therapy\r\nChronic Disease\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nHeadache/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nMovement Disorders/drug therapy\r\n*Nervous System Diseases/drug therapy/etiology\r\nPain/drug therapy\r\nPeripheral Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced/drug therapy\r\nPyridoxine/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology/therapeutic use/toxicity\r\nSeizures/drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bernstein AL (1990) Vitamin B6 in clinical neurology..

This imbalance between the excitatory and inhibitory neurons may contribute to the onset of depression. At the cellular level there is an increase in the concentration of intracellular Ca(2+) within the inhibitory neurons that is driven by an increase in entry through the NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and through activation of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway that generates inositol trisphosphate (InsP(3)) that releases Ca(2+) from the internal stores. The importance of these two pathways in driving the elevation of Ca(2+) is supported by the fact that depression can be alleviated by ketamine that inhibits the NMDARs and scopolamine that inhibits the M1 receptors that drive InsP(3)/Ca(2+) pathway. This increase in Ca(2+) not only contributes to depression but it may also explain why individuals with depression have a strong likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease. The enhanced levels of Ca(2+) may stimulate the formation of Aβ to initiate the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Just how vitamin D acts to reduce depression is unclear. The phenotypic stability hypothesis argues that vitamin D acts by reducing the increased neuronal levels of Ca(2+) that are driving depression. This action of vitamin D depends on its function to maintain the expression of the Ca(2+) pumps and buffers that reduce Ca(2+) levels, which may explain how it acts to reduce the onset of depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Berridge MJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1124/pr.116.013227 ","Keywords":"Alzheimer Disease/metabolism\r\nAnimals\r\nCalcium Signaling\r\nDepression/*metabolism/physiopathology\r\nHumans\r\nInflammation/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nNeurons/physiology\r\nVitamin D/*metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Berridge MJ (2017) Vitamin D and Depression: Cellular and Regulatory Mechanisms..

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a cross-sectional and prospective analysis of vitamin D intake from foods and supplements and risk of depressive symptoms. DESIGN: Study participants were 81,189 members of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study who were aged 50-79 y at baseline. Vitamin D intake at baseline was measured by food-frequency and supplement-use questionnaires. Depressive symptoms at baseline and after 3 y were assessed by using the Burnam scale and current antidepressant medication use. RESULTS: After age, physical activity, and other factors were controlled for, women who reported a total intake of ≥800 IU vitamin D/d had a prevalence OR for depressive symptoms of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.89; P-trend < 0.001) compared with women who reported a total intake of <100 IU vitamin D/d. In analyses limited to women without evidence of depression at baseline, an intake of ≥400 compared with <100 IU vitamin D/d from food sources was associated with 20% lower risk of depressive symptoms at year 3 (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.95; P-trend = 0.001). The results for supplemental vitamin D were less consistent, as were the results from secondary analyses that included as cases women who were currently using antidepressant medications. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings support a potential inverse association of vitamin D, primarily from food sources, and depressive symptoms in postmenopausal women. Additional prospective studies and randomized trials are essential in establishing whether the improvement of vitamin D status holds promise for the prevention of depression, the treatment of depression, or both.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bertone-Johnson ER ; Powers SI ; Spangler L ; Brunner RL ; Michael YL ; Larson JC ; Millen AE ; Bueche MN ; Salmoirago-Blotcher E ; Liu S ; Wassertheil-Smoller S ; Ockene JK ; Ockene I ; Manson JE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3945/ajcn.111.017384 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/drug therapy/*epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control\r\n*Diet\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPostmenopause\r\nPrevalence\r\nProspective Studies\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nRisk\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nUnited States/epidemiology\r\nVitamin D/*administration & dosage\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/physiopathology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bertone-Johnson ER, Powers SI, Spangler L, Brunner RL, Michael YL, Larson JC, Millen AE, Bueche MN, Salmoirago-Blotcher E, Liu S, Wassertheil-Smoller S, Ockene JK, Ockene I, and Manson JE (2011) Vitamin D intake from foods and supplements and depressive symptoms in a diverse population of older women..

In this study, we attempted to cross-link plasma folate, depressive symptoms, and dietary quality (or dietary intake of folate) together in a comprehensive framework, while examining effect modification of those associations by sex. This was a cross-sectional, population-based study of 1681 participants aged 30-64 y (Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Lifespan Study). Participants were administered the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D). Measures of plasma folate and dietary intakes (2 24-h recalls) from which the 2005-Healthy Eating Index (HEI) was computed were available. Multivariate logistic regression and structural equation modeling (SM) were conducted. Compared with the lowest tertile, the middle and uppermost tertiles of plasma folate were associated with a 39-40% reduced odds of elevated CES-D (> or =16) among women [adjusted odds ratio (T(3) vs. T(1)) = 0.60 (95% CI = 0.42-0.86); P = 0.006]. Confounding of this association by HEI(total) was noted among both men and women, although dietary folate did not confound this association appreciably. In SM, plasma folate completely mediated the inverse HEI(total)-CES-D association among men only, specifically for HEI(2) (higher intakes of whole fruits), HEI(3) (total vegetables), HEI(5) (total grains), HEI(6) (whole grains), HEI(7) (milk), and HEI(12) (lower discretionary energy). Among women, HEI(total) and 4 components had an inverse direct effect on CES-D score, suggesting a mechanism that is independent of plasma folate. Depressive symptoms in our study may be alleviated by improving overall dietary quality, with plasma folate playing a potential mediating role only among men.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Beydoun MA ; Fanelli Kuczmarski MT; Beydoun HA ; Shroff MR ; Mason MA ; Evans MK ; Zonderman AB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3945/jn.109.113878 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/*etiology\r\nDiet/*standards\r\nDiet Records\r\nDiet Surveys\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/administration & dosage/*blood\r\nFolic Acid Deficiency/*complications\r\nHumans\r\nLogistic Models\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOdds Ratio\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSex Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Beydoun MA, Fanelli Kuczmarski MT, Beydoun HA, Shroff MR, Mason MA, Evans MK, and Zonderman AB (2010) The sex-specific role of plasma folate in mediating the association of dietary quality with depressive symptoms..

We describe associations of dietary antioxidants with cognitive function in a large biracial population, while testing moderation by sex, race, and age and mediation by depressive symptoms. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of 1274 adults (541 men and 733 women) aged 30 to 64 years at baseline (mean [standard deviation] = 47.5 [9.3]) in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Lifespan Study, Baltimore city, MD. Cognitive performance in the domains of memory, language/verbal, attention, spatial, psychomotor speed, executive function, and global mental status were assessed. The 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale was used to measure depressive symptoms. Dietary intake was assessed with two 24-hour recalls, estimating daily consumption of total carotenoids and vitamins A, C, and E per 1000 kcal. RESULTS: Among key findings, 1 standard deviation (∼ 2.02 mg/1000 kcal) higher vitamin E was associated with a higher score on verbal memory, immediate recall (β = +0.64 [0.19], p = .001), and better language/verbal fluency performance (β = +0.53 [0.16], p = .001), particularly among the younger age group. Women with higher vitamin E intake (β = +0.68 [0.21], p = .001) had better performance on a psychomotor speed test. The vitamin E-verbal memory association was partially mediated by depressive symptoms (proportion mediated = 13%-16%). CONCLUSIONS: In sum, future cohort studies and dietary interventions should focus on associations of dietary vitamin E with cognitive decline, specifically for domains of verbal memory, verbal fluency, and psychomotor speed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Beydoun MA ; Fanelli-Kuczmarski MT ; Kitner-Triolo MH ; Beydoun HA ; Kaufman JS ; Mason MA ; Evans MK ; Zonderman AB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/PSY.0000000000000129 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAfrican Americans\r\n*Antioxidants\r\nAscorbic Acid\r\nAttention\r\nCarotenoids\r\n*Cognition\r\nCohort Studies\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nExecutive Function\r\n*Feeding Behavior\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMemory\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNeuropsychological Tests\r\nPsychomotor Performance\r\nUnited States\r\nVitamin A\r\nVitamin E\r\nWhites","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Beydoun MA, Fanelli-Kuczmarski MT, Kitner-Triolo MH, Beydoun HA, Kaufman JS, Mason MA, Evans MK, and Zonderman AB (2015) Dietary antioxidant intake and its association with cognitive function in an ethnically diverse sample of US adults..

This review sought to examine literature investigating the role of kiwifruit in supporting psychological well-being in adult populations through increased vitamin C intake. The literature search using CINAHL, Embase and PubMed databases was restricted to English-language articles published from 2005 through July 2022. Inclusion criteria were randomized trials that delivered kiwifruit interventions to adult populations assessing psychological well-being. Studies were assessed for bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool for randomized controlled trials. The literature search identified two eligible trials involving 202 participants that delivered gold kiwifruit interventions and evaluated aspects of psychological well-being (e.g., mood disturbance, vitality, vigour, depression). Daily consumption of two gold kiwifruit was associated with significant reductions in mood disturbance and fatigue, and significant increases in well-being and vigour. Larger effects were observed in participants with higher baseline mood disturbance. Additional research involving a broader range of cohorts and isolating the effects of other micronutrients within gold kiwifruit implicated in the pathophysiology of depression is warranted. Overall, preliminary evidence suggests that daily consumption of two gold kiwifruit might improve psychological well-being in adult populations.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Billows M ; Kakoschke N ; Zajac IT ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu14214657 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nHumans\r\n*Anxiety/therapy\r\nAnxiety Disorders\r\nFatigue/therapy\r\n*Fruit\r\nkiwifruit\r\nmood\r\npsychological well-being\r\nvitamin C status","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Billows M, Kakoschke N, and Zajac IT (2022) The Role of Kiwifruit in Supporting Psychological Well-Being: A Rapid Review of the Literature..

This study investigated the effect of ascorbic acid in the tail suspension test (TST) and in the forced swimming test (FST) in mice and the contribution of the monoaminergic system to its antidepressant-like effect. Moreover, the effects of fluoxetine, imipramine and bupropion in combination with ascorbic acid in the TST were investigated. Ascorbic acid (0.1-10 mg/kg, i.p., 1-10 mg/kg p.o. or 0.1 nmol/mice i.c.v.) produced an antidepressant-like effect in the TST, but not in the FST, without altering the locomotor activity. The effect of ascorbic acid (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) in the TST was prevented by i.p. pre-treatment with NAN-190 (0.5 mg/kg), ketanserin (5 mg/kg), MDL72222 (0.1 mg/kg), prazosin (62.5 microg/kg), yohimbine (1 mg/kg), propranolol (2 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg), sulpiride (50 mg/kg), but not with SCH23390 (0.05 mg/kg, s.c.). Additionally, ascorbic acid (1 mg/kg, p.o.) potentiated the effect of subeffective doses (p.o. route) of fluoxetine (1 mg/kg), imipramine (0.1 mg/kg), or bupropion (1 mg/kg) in the TST. The combined treatment of ascorbic acid with antidepressants produced no alteration in the locomotion in the open-field test. In conclusion, our results show that administration of ascorbic acid produces an antidepressant-like effect in TST, which is dependent on its interaction with the monoaminergic system. Moreover, ascorbic acid caused a synergistic antidepressant-like effect with conventional antidepressants. Therefore, the present findings warrant further studies to evaluate the therapeutical relevance of ascorbic acid for the treatment of depression and as a co-adjuvant treatment with antidepressants.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Binfaré RW ; Rosa AO ; Lobato KR ; Santos AR ; Rodrigues AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2009.02.003 ","Keywords":"Analysis of Variance\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAscorbic Acid/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBiogenic Monoamines/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Administration Routes\r\nDrug Interactions\r\nFemale\r\nHindlimb Suspension/methods\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nNeurotransmitter Agents/pharmacology\r\nSwimming\r\nSynaptic Transmission/*drug effects/physiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Binfaré RW, Rosa AO, Lobato KR, Santos AR, and Rodrigues AL (2009) Ascorbic acid administration produces an antidepressant-like effect: evidence for the involvement of monoaminergic neurotransmission..

We aimed to evaluate the quantity, validity, and credibility of evidence regarding associations between folate and multiple health outcomes by using umbrella review of meta-analysis. Methods: We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases from inception to May 20, 2018, to identify potential meta-analyses that examined the association of folate with any health outcome. For each included meta-analysis, we estimated the summary effect size and their 95% confidence interval using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model. We used the AMSTAR 2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) to assess methodological quality and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation working group classification) to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome included in the umbrella review. Results: Overall, 108 articles reporting 133 meta-analyses of observational studies and 154 meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the study. Among them, 108 unique exposure-outcome-population triplets (referred to as unique meta-analyses hereafter) of RCTs and 87 unique meta-analyses of observational studies were reanalyzed. Beneficial effects of folate were observed in the all-cause mortality rate and in a number of chronic diseases, including several birth/pregnancy outcomes, several cancers, cardiovascular disease and metabolic-related outcomes, neurological conditions, and several other diseases. However, adverse effects of folate were observed for prostate cancer, colorectal adenomatous lesions, asthma or wheezing, and wheezing as an isolated symptom and depression. Conclusions: Current evidence allows for the conclusion that folate is associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality and a wide range of chronic diseases. However, folate may be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. Further research is warranted to improve the certainty of the estimates.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bo Y ; Zhu Y ; Tao Y ; Li X ; Zhai D ; Bu Y ; Wan Z ; Wang L ; Wang Y ; Yu Z ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fpubh.2020.550753 ","Keywords":"*Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\n*Neoplasms/epidemiology\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Outcome\r\nchronic diseases\r\nfolate\r\nmeta-analysis\r\nmultiple health outcomes\r\numbrella review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bo Y, Zhu Y, Tao Y, Li X, Zhai D, Bu Y, Wan Z, Wang L, Wang Y, and Yu Z (2020) Association Between Folate and Health Outcomes: An Umbrella Review of Meta-Analyses..

Poor diet quality, ubiquitous in the United States, may be a modifiable risk factor for depression. The objective was to review and synthesize the current knowledge of the role of nutrition in depression, and address implications for childbearing-aged women. Poor omega-3 fatty acid status increases the risk of depression. Fish oil and folic acid supplements each have been used to treat depression successfully. Folate deficiency reduces the response to antidepressants. Deficiencies of folate, vitamin B12, iron, zinc, and selenium tend to be more common among depressed than nondepressed persons. Dietary antioxidants have not been studied rigorously in relation to depression. Childbearing-aged women are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of poor nutrition on mood because pregnancy and lactation are major nutritional stressors to the body. The depletion of nutrient reserves throughout pregnancy and a lack of recovery postpartum may increase a woman's risk of depression. Prospective research studies are needed to clarify the role of nutrition in the pathophysiology of depression among childbearing-aged women. Greater attention to nutritional factors in mental health is warranted given that nutrition interventions can be inexpensive, safe, easy to administer, and generally acceptable to patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bodnar LM ; Wisner KL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.05.009 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDepression/*psychology\r\nHumans\r\n*Mental Health\r\n*Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nNutritional Status\r\nWomen/*psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bodnar LM, and Wisner KL (2005) Nutrition and depression: implications for improving mental health among childbearing-aged women..

Dietary vitamin K intake was collected through a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and categorized in quartiles. Depressive symptoms were diagnosed using the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) ≥ 16. To investigate the associations between vitamin K intake and depressive symptoms, logistic regression analysis were run, which adjusted for potential confounders. Overall, 437 (=10%) subjects had depressive symptoms. After adjusting for 11 confounders, people with the highest dietary vitamin K intake had lower odds of having depressive symptoms (OR = 0.58; 95%CI: 0.43⁻0.80). This effect was only present in people not taking vitamin D supplementation. In conclusion, higher dietary vitamin K intake was significantly associated with a lower presence of depressive symptoms, also after accounting for potential confounders. Future longitudinal research is required to explore the directionality of the association.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bolzetta F ; Veronese N ; Stubbs B ; Noale M ; Vaona A ; Demurtas J ; Celotto S ; Cacco C ; Cester A ; Caruso MG ; Reddavide R ; Notarnicola M ; Maggi S ; Koyanagi A ; Fornaro M ; Firth J ; Smith L ; Solmi M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu11040787 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nCohort Studies\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/*etiology\r\n*Diet\r\nFemale\r\nFood Analysis\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nVitamin K/*administration & dosage\r\nVitamin K Deficiency/*complications\r\nOsteoarthritis Initiative\r\ndepression\r\ndiet\r\nmental health\r\nnutrition\r\nvitamin K","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bolzetta F, Veronese N, Stubbs B, Noale M, Vaona A, Demurtas J, Celotto S, Cacco C, Cester A, Caruso MG, Reddavide R, Notarnicola M, Maggi S, Koyanagi A, Fornaro M, Firth J, Smith L, and Solmi M (2019) The Relationship between Dietary Vitamin K and Depressive Symptoms in Late Adulthood: A Cross-Sectional Analysis from a Large Cohort Study..

We also aimed to gather the evidence supporting the recommendations for supplementation in clinical practice. METHODS: Performed between March 2020 and September 2021, the main inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with patients ≥ 18 years old, both sexes, fulfilling target diagnoses of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or mild to severe depressive and anxiety symptoms. In addition, the RCTs were included if the scales to assess the severity of the symptoms were standardized rating scales in psychiatric. Trials that reported diagnoses of schizophrenia, perinatal depression, bipolar depression, sleep disorders, eating disorders, cancer, and multiple sclerosis in association with any of the mentioned diagnoses were excluded. RESULTS: We identified 20 RCTs that matched all eligibility criteria, totaling 2,256 subjects, diagnosed with MDD, GAD, and depressive or anxiety symptoms. Supplementation with folic acid or L-methylfolate, B1, B12 or methylcobalamin, and vitamin D (in different doses and study duration) significantly decreased depression score scales by increasing response to standard pharmacological treatment or as monotherapy, including partial or complete remission. As for anxiety symptoms, the availability of results is limited to adjuvant vitamin D therapy. DISCUSSION: B vitamins and vitamin D associated with other compounds also showed significant results, so the improvement in symptoms cannot be attributed strictly to those. Our results suggest that intervention with B vitamins and/or vitamin D may be an effective and well-tolerated adjuvant strategy for improving the symptoms of depression and anxiety, according to the patient's clinical status and nutritional biomarkers.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Borges-Vieira JG ; Cardoso CKS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/1028415X.2022.2031494 ","Keywords":"B vitamins\r\nHomocysteine\r\nL-methylfolate\r\ngeneralized anxiety disorder\r\nmajor depressive disorder\r\nthiamine\r\nvitamin B12\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Borges-Vieira JG, and Cardoso CKS (2022) Efficacy of B-vitamins and vitamin D therapy in improving depressive and anxiety disorders: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials..

The second group (9 patients) comprised idiopathic cases of folic acid deficiency. Their main subjective complaints were chronic fatigability and familial restless legs syndrome. The neurological findings were similar to those of the patients with acquired disorders. Neuropsychological testing procedures revealed an abnormal intellectual functioning in all 16 patients. Abnormal patterns of radionuclide cisternograms and computerized transaxial tomography (CTT) were found in 11 patients. After 6-12 months of folic acid therapy a striking improvement regarding their intellectual functioning was noticed: the IQ, Kohs Block Design and Category tests were significantly improved. The correlation of neuropsychological findings with CTT and radionuclide cisternograms led to the conclusion that chronic folate deficiency could induce cerebral atrophy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Botez MI ; Fontaine F ; Botez T ; Bachevalier J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000114904 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAtrophy\r\nCerebral Ventricles/diagnostic imaging/pathology\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid Deficiency/*complications\r\nHumans\r\nIntelligence Tests\r\nIntestinal Mucosa/pathology\r\nJejunum/pathology\r\nMale\r\nMental Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNervous System Diseases/diagnostic imaging/*etiology\r\nRadionuclide Imaging\r\nRestless Legs Syndrome/diagnostic imaging/etiology\r\nTomography, X-Ray Computed","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Botez MI, Fontaine F, Botez T, and Bachevalier J (1977) Folate-responsive neurological and mental disorders: report of 16 cases.

Because of the high intensity of urbanization, our lifestyle and food have altered dramatically in the last twenty years. These food modifications have been associated with scores of depression and other affective-related disorders in urbanized countries with high economic levels. Nutrients imbalance is considered as one of the critical causes enabling the pathophysiological mechanisms for the development of psychiatric disorders. The application of additional nutritional interventions for treatment of mood deteriorations can be beneficial for both the prophylaxis and therapy of affective-related disorders.

RECENT FINDINGS: Oral supplementation with nicotinamide riboside can inhibit the accumulation of pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease and improve learning and memory in various murine models for dementia. Nicotinamide riboside can also reduce DNA damage, neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and improved hippocampal synaptic plasticity in diabetic mice, and another Alzheimer's disease mouse model. The cognitive benefits of nicotinamide riboside in Alzheimer's disease models may be modulated in part by upregulation of proliferator-activated-γ coactivator 1α-mediated β-secretase 1(BACE-1) ubiquitination and degradation, preventing Aβ production in the brain. Nicotinamide riboside also maintained blood-brain barrier integrity and maintained the gut microbiota in a mouse model for cerebral small vessel disease and alcohol-induced depression, respectively. Oral nicotinamide riboside has been shown to be bioavailable and well tolerated in humans with limited adverse effects compared to other NAD+ precursors. SUMMARY: Oral nicotinamide riboside may represent a promising stratagem to improve cognitive decline during 'normal' ageing, Alzheimer's disease and other diseases. Results from recent clinical trials are needed to enumerate the preclinical benefits in humans.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Braidy N ; Liu Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/MCO.0000000000000691 ","Keywords":"Alzheimer Disease/prevention & control/*therapy\r\nAmyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/metabolism\r\nAnimals\r\nAspartic Acid Endopeptidases/metabolism\r\nBrain/metabolism\r\nCognitive Aging/*physiology\r\nCognitive Dysfunction/prevention & control/*therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nHumans\r\nMice\r\nNiacinamide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives\r\nPyridinium Compounds/*administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Braidy N, and Liu Y (2020) Can nicotinamide riboside protect against cognitive impairment?.

Requirements for riboflavin, thiamine, B12, and B6 may be increased by the use of oral contraceptives, whereas niacin requirements may be reduced. Fat-soluble vitamins are also influenced by oral contraceptives. There is evidence of increases in plasma Vitamin-A and decreases in plasma tocopherols in users of oral contraceptives; Vitamin-D, Vitamin-K, and biotin, however, have not been shown to be affected. Normalization of vitamin status can be effected fairly quickly by use of a daily multivitamin. Desirable doses are as follows: ascorbic acid, 400-500 mg; ribovlavin, 10 mg; B6, 5 mg; B12, 4 mcg; and d-alpha-tocopherol, 10 mg; optimal thiamine intake is not known . Clinical signs of hypovitaminosis include depression, susceptibility to infections, and skin signs, all of which were found in users of oral contraceptives in an epidemiological survey of 46,000 women in Great Britain. Adverse psychological, dermatological, and hematological side effects of oral contraceptives have also responded to vitamin therapy. Routine prophylactic prescription of carefully formulated supplemental vitamin mixtures is recommended.\n\n皮普: 大多数使用口服避孕药的妇女应该每天服用维生素补充剂，其剂量要经过仔细调整，以避免特定维生素过量。对核黄素、抗神经炎维生素、维生素 b12和维生素 b6的需求可能会因使用口服避孕药而增加，而对烟酸的需求则可能会减少。脂溶性维生素也受口服避孕药的影响。有证据表明，口服避孕药使用者血浆中维生素 a 含量增加，血浆生育酚含量降低，但维生素 D、维生素 K 和生物素并未受到影响。维生素状态的正常化可以通过使用每日复合维生素相当迅速地实现。适当剂量如下: 抗坏血酸(400-500毫克)、核黄素(10毫克)、维生素 B6(5毫克)、维生素 B12(4微克)和 d-α-生育酚(10毫克) ，抗神经炎维生素的最佳摄入量尚不清楚。维生素缺乏症的临床症状包括抑郁、易感染和皮肤症状，所有这些症状都是在使用口服避孕药的流行病学调查中发现的。口服避孕药的不良心理、皮肤和血液副作用也对维生素治疗有反应。常规预防处方仔细配制补充维生素混合物是推荐的。","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Briggs M ; Briggs M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Avitaminosis/*chemically induced/prevention & control\r\nContraceptives, Oral/*adverse effects\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nNutritional Requirements\r\nVitamins/administration & dosage\r\n*Ascorbic Acid\r\nBiology\r\nContraception\r\nContraceptive Methods--side effects\r\nFamily Planning\r\n*Oral Contraceptives--side effects\r\nPhysiology\r\n*Vitamin A\r\n*Vitamin B Complex\r\nVitamins","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Briggs M, and Briggs M (1975) Letter: Oral contraceptives and vitamin requirements..

However, very few studies have investigated its effect in behavioral models of depression. Hence, this study tested its effect in the forced swimming test (FST) and the tail suspension test (TST), two models predictive of antidepressant activity, in mice. Folic acid administered by oral route (p.o.) produced a reduction in the immobility time in the FST (50-100mg/kg) and in the TST (10-50mg/kg). The administration of folic acid by i.c.v. route also reduced the immobility time in the FST (10nmol/site) and in the TST (1-10nmol/site). Both folic acid administered by oral and i.c.v. route produced no psychostimulant effect, which indicates that its antidepressant-like effect is specific. Pretreatment of mice with p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester (PCPA; 100mg/kg, i.p., an inhibitor of serotonin (5-HT) synthesis, for 4 consecutive days), ketanserin (5mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist), prazosin (1mg/kg, i.p., an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist) or yohimbine (1mg/kg, i.p., an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist) prevented the anti-immobility effect of folic acid (50mg/kg, p.o.) in the FST. Moreover, the pretreatment of mice with WAY100635 (0.1mg/kg, s.c., a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist) blocked the decrease in immobility time in the FST elicited by folic acid (50mg/kg, p.o.), but produced a synergistic effect with a subeffective dose of folic acid (10mg/kg, p.o.). In addition, a subeffective dose of folic acid (10mg/kg, p.o.) produced a synergistic antidepressant-like effect with fluoxetine (10mg/kg, p.o.) in the FST. Overall, the results firstly indicate that folic acid produced an antidepressant-like effect in FST and in TST and that this effect appears to be mediated by an interaction with the serotonergic (5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors) and noradrenergic (alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors) systems.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Brocardo PS ; Budni J ; Kaster MP ; Santos AR ; Rodrigues AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuropharm.2007.10.016 ","Keywords":"Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists/pharmacology\r\nAnimals\r\n*Antidepressive Agents\r\nDepression/psychology\r\nFemale\r\nFenclonine/pharmacology\r\nFluoxetine/pharmacology\r\nFolic Acid/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nHindlimb Suspension/psychology\r\nInjections, Intraventricular\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nNorepinephrine/*physiology\r\nPrazosin/pharmacology\r\nReceptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A/drug effects\r\nSerotonin/*physiology\r\nSerotonin Agents/pharmacology\r\nSerotonin Uptake Inhibitors/pharmacology\r\nSwimming/psychology\r\nYohimbine/pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Brocardo PS, Budni J, Kaster MP, Santos AR, and Rodrigues AL (2008) Folic acid administration produces an antidepressant-like effect in mice: evidence for the involvement of the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems..

METHODS: In this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled 14 day trial of sustained-release AA (42 healthy young adults; 3000 mg/day Cetebe) and placebo (39 healthy young adults), subjects with partners recorded penile-vaginal intercourse (FSI), noncoital partner sex, and masturbation in daily diaries, and also completed the Beck Depression Inventory before and after the trial. RESULTS: The AA group reported greater FSI (but, as hypothesized, not other sexual behavior) frequency, an effect most prominent in subjects not cohabiting with their sexual partner, and in women. The AA but not placebo group also experienced a decrease in Beck Depression scores. CONCLUSIONS: AA appears to increase FSI, and the differential benefit to noncohabitants suggests that a central activation or disinhibition, rather than peripheral mechanism may be responsible.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Brody S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0006-3223(02)01329-x ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAffect/*drug effects\r\nAscorbic Acid/blood/*pharmacology\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nSexual Behavior/*drug effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Brody S (2002) High-dose ascorbic acid increases intercourse frequency and improves mood: a randomized controlled clinical trial..

This eight-week randomized experiment with a placebo-control group targeted women with symptoms of mild to moderate depression. Women in the intervention group were instructed to take a brisk 20-minute outdoor walk at target heart rate of 60% of maximum heart rate, to increase light exposure throughout the day and to take a specific vitamin regimen. Women in the control group took a daily placebo vitamin. The sample consisted of 112 women ages 19-78 who reported mild to moderate depressive symptoms. They were in otherwise good health and were not currently taking any mood-altering medication. Pre- and post-intervention assessment utilized live measures of mood: Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale, Profile of Mood States, Depression-Happiness Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the General Well-Being Schedule. Analysis of covariance indicated that the intervention was effective in improving women's overall mood, self-esteem, and general sense of well-being and in decreasing symptoms on two measures of depression. Of particular note, the data from all five outcome measures supported the efficacy of the intervention. In addition, a high level of adherence to the intervention protocol was observed with two-thirds of the women reporting 100% adherence. Study implications suggest that this type of intervention may provide an effective, clinically manageable therapy for mild-to-moderately depressed women who prefer a self-directed approach or who have difficulties with the cost or side-effects of medication or psychotherapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Brown MA ; Goldstein-Shirley J ; Robinson J ; Casey S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1300/J013v34n03_06 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAffect/*physiology\r\nAged\r\nAnalysis of Variance\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nComplementary Therapies\r\nDepressive Disorder/epidemiology/*therapy\r\nExercise/physiology/*psychology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLife Style\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nSeasonal Affective Disorder/therapy\r\n*Self Efficacy\r\nSunlight\r\nVitamins/*therapeutic use\r\nWashington","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Brown MA, Goldstein-Shirley J, Robinson J, and Casey S (2001) The effects of a multi-modal intervention trial of light, exercise, and vitamins on women's mood..

In the article, the authors review the quality of the evidence supporting the clinical effects of a number of commonly used types of complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) for mood disorders, anxiety, and insomnia. They review data on the use of St. John's Wort, S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM-e), B vitamins, inositol, omega-3 fatty acids, and choline for mood disorders; data on the use of kava and other herbal agents and fish extract for anxiety and insomnia; and data on valerian and melatonin for insomnia. The authors also discuss the use of CAM to treat migraines, which may be comorbid with mood and anxiety disorders, and obesity, which can occur as a side effect of psychotropic medications. They consider the data on feverfew and butterbur for migraines and on chromium picolinate and the combination of ephedrine and caffeine for obesity. The authors also review issues related to comorbid medical illness, side effects, drug interactions, dosage, and brand selection.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Brown RP ; Gerbarg PL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00131746-200103000-00002 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Brown RP, and Gerbarg PL (2001) Herbs and nutrients in the treatment of depression, anxiety, insomnia, migraine, and obesity..

When started at least one month before conception, folic acid supplements can prevent neural tube defects. Targeted genetic screening and counseling should be offered on the basis of age, ethnic background, or family history. Before conception, women should be screened for human immunodeficiency virus and syphilis infection and begin treatment to prevent the transmission of disease to the fetus. Immunizations against hepatitis B, rubella, and varicella should be completed, if needed. Women should be counseled on ways to prevent infection with toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, and parvovirus B19. Environmental toxins such as cigarette smoke, alcohol, and street drugs, and chemicals such as solvents and pesticides should be avoided. In women with diabetes, it is important to optimize disease control through intensive management before pregnancy. Medications for hypertension, epilepsy, thromboembolism, depression, and anxiety should be reviewed and changed, if necessary, before the patient becomes pregnant. Counseling about exercise, obesity, nutritional deficiencies, and the overuse of vitamins A and D is beneficial.

Considering that several studies have indicated that folic acid plays an important role in the pathophysiology of depression, the present study investigated the involvement of potassium channels in the antidepressant-like effect of this vitamin. For this aim, the effect of the combined administration of different types of K(+) channel blockers and folic acid in the forced swimming test (FST) was investigated. Treatment of mice by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) route with subactive doses of glibenclamide (an ATP-sensitive K(+) channels blocker, 0.5pg/site), charybdotoxin (a large- and intermediate-conductance calcium-activated K(+) channel blocker, 25pg/site) or apamin (a small-conductance calcium-activated K(+) channel blocker, 10pg/site), augmented the effect of folic acid (10mg/kg, p.o., subeffective dose) in the FST. Additionally, the administration of folic acid and the K(+) channel blockers, alone or in combination, did not affect locomotion in the open-field test. Moreover, the reduction in the immobility time in the FST elicited by folic acid administered at a higher dose (50mg/kg, p.o.) was prevented by the pretreatment of mice with the K(+) channel opener cromakalim (10μg/site, i.c.v.), without affecting locomotor activity. The results of this study indicate that the antidepressant-like effect of folic acid in the FST may be at least partly due to its modulatory effects on neuronal excitability, via inhibition of K(+) channels.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Budni J ; Freitas AE ; Binfaré RW ; Rodrigues AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pbb.2011.12.008 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Antidepressive Agents\r\nApamin/pharmacology\r\nCharybdotoxin/pharmacology\r\nCromakalim/pharmacology\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/*pharmacology\r\nGlyburide/pharmacology\r\nHypoglycemic Agents/pharmacology\r\nInjections, Intraventricular\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nPotassium Channel Blockers/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nPotassium Channels/*drug effects\r\nSwimming/*psychology\r\nVasodilator Agents/pharmacology\r\nVitamins/*pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Budni J, Freitas AE, Binfaré RW, and Rodrigues AL (2012) Role of potassium channels in the antidepressant-like effect of folic acid in the forced swimming test in mice..

Folic acid has been reported to present antidepressant-like effects in both experimental and clinical approaches. However, the mechanisms mediating such effects are not understood. In the present study, we evaluated if folic acid administration to mice could protect against restraint stress-induced depressive-like behavior and cognitive deficit. Considering that oxidative stress has been pointed as a key event involved with depressive disorders, cerebrocortical and hippocampal oxidative stress-related parameters, such as the activities of antioxidant enzymes (mainly those related to the hydroperoxide-detoxifying system) and markers of lipid peroxidation, were also investigated. Restraint stress induced depressive-like behavior in the forced swimming test and memory impairment in the object recognition test, without altering locomotor activity of mice. Folic acid (50 mg/kg, p.o.) was able to prevent the stress-induced increase on immobility time in the forced swimming test, but did not prevent memory impairment. Moreover, restraint stress increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels, and catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and superoxide dismutase activity in the hippocampus. Folic acid treatment restored the activity of the antioxidant enzymes and reduced lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus. Glutathione, a non-enzymatic antioxidant, was not altered by stress and/or folic acid administration. Together, the results of the present work reinforce the notion that folic acid displays a specific antidepressant profile in the restraint stress paradigm that may be at least partly due to its antioxidant role.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Budni J ; Zomkowski AD ; Engel D ; Santos DB ; dos Santos AA; Moretti M ; Valvassori SS ; Ornell F ; Quevedo J ; Farina M ; Rodrigues AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.expneurol.2012.10.024 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntioxidants/*adverse effects/metabolism\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects/physiology\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/metabolism/*prevention & control\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFolic Acid/*therapeutic use\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/*metabolism/physiopathology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nOxidative Stress/drug effects/physiology\r\nRestraint, Physical/*adverse effects\r\nStress, Psychological/*etiology/metabolism/psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Budni J, Zomkowski AD, Engel D, Santos DB, dos Santos AA, Moretti M, Valvassori SS, Ornell F, Quevedo J, Farina M, and Rodrigues AL (2013) Folic acid prevents depressive-like behavior and hippocampal antioxidant imbalance induced by restraint stress in mice..

Folic acid reduced the immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) in control mice (10-50 mg/kg, p.o) and abolished the depressive-like behavior elicited by TNF-α (0.001 fg/site, i.c.v.) in this test (1-50 mg/kg, p.o). Coadministration of subthreshold doses of folic acid (1 mg/kg, p.o.) and fluoxetine, imipramine, bupropion, MK-801, or 7-nitroindazole produced an antidepressant-like effect in mice exposed or not to TNF-α. TNF-α-treated mice presented increased p38(MAPK) phosphorylation and decreased Akt phosphorylation, and the later effect was prevented by folic acid (10 mg/kg, p.o.). Additionally, ERK1 phosphorylation was increased in mice treated with TNF-α + folic acid (1 mg/kg), but no effects on ERK2 or JNK1/2/3 phosphorylation were found in any group. The results indicate the efficacy of folic acid to counteract the depressive-like behavior induced by a pro-inflammatory cytokine, an effect that might be associated with the activation of monoaminergic systems, inhibition of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, as well as Akt modulation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Budni J ; Moretti M ; Freitas AE ; Neis VB ; Ribeiro CM ; de Oliveira Balen G; Rieger DK ; Leal RB ; Rodrigues ALS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2021.113512 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nDepression/*chemically induced/*drug therapy/*metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nMice\r\nTumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology\r\nVitamin B Complex/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nAkt\r\nAntidepressant\r\nDepression\r\nFolic acid\r\nTNF-α\r\nTail suspension test","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Budni J, Moretti M, Freitas AE, Neis VB, Ribeiro CM, de Oliveira Balen G, Rieger DK, Leal RB, and Rodrigues ALS (2021) Behavioral and neurochemical effects of folic acid in a mouse model of depression induced by TNF-α..

Preventive interventions on neuroinflammation seem to be able to interfere with neurodegeneration. Supplementation of essential nutrients, such as long-chain-polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin E and mineral elements, may minimize inflammation, enhancing antioxidative defense, and lowering the risk and incidence of age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. This manuscript reviews the current evidence on the role of neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative and mental disorders, and preventive strategies for food supplementation in these neuropsychiatric diseases. Dietary supplementation-based strategies have been demonstrated to be effective in subjects with mild cognitive impairment, while weaker results have been obtained in patients with advance neurodegenerative disease. Adjunctive supplementation has also been demonstrated to improve depression, this being of marked benefit considering the comorbidity between cognitive impairment/dementia and depression. Further research is needed to improve the prescriptive precision of supplementation in patients, and to better understand potential interactions with clinical and pharmacokinetic factors.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Businaro R ; Vauzour D ; Sarris J ; Münch G ; Gyengesi E ; Brogelli L ; Zuzarte P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fnut.2021.669846 ","Keywords":"brain health\r\ndepression\r\ndiet\r\ngut-brain axis\r\nneuroinflammation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Businaro R, Vauzour D, Sarris J, Münch G, Gyengesi E, Brogelli L, and Zuzarte P (2021) Therapeutic Opportunities for Food Supplements in Neurodegenerative Disease and Depression..

The present study aimed to investigate the cholecalciferol capability to revert depressive-like behavior induced by chronic corticosterone (CORT) treatment in mice and its implication on the oxidative stress modulation. Sixty minutes after having orally received different doses of cholecalciferol, adult male mice were evaluated in the forced swimming and tail suspension tests, whereas in the seven-day treatment they were only tested in tail suspension. Additionally, for 21 days, the animals received CORT (20 mg/kg, p.o.) and cholecalciferol or fluoxetine, once a day for the last 7-days of the CORT treatment. Moreover, the markers of oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl and nitrite levels were assessed in the plasma and brain's mice after the splash and tail suspension tests. It was observed that ﻿corticosterone treatment resulted in depressive-like behavior with established oxidative stress in mice, while cholecalciferol ameliorated both, behavioral (immobility time and grooming latency) and biochemical (protein carbonyl and nitrite levels) changes induced by CORT model, suggesting that cholecalciferol has antidepressant-like effect with the involvement of the oxidative stress modulation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Camargo A ; Dalmagro AP ; Rikel L ; da Silva EB ; Simão da Silva KAB; Zeni ALB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejphar.2018.07.002 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nCholecalciferol/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nCorticosterone/toxicity\r\nDepression/chemically induced/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFluoxetine/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nLipid Peroxidation/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nOxidative Stress/*drug effects\r\nToxicity Tests, Acute\r\nToxicity Tests, Subchronic\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nCholecalciferol\r\nCorticosterone\r\nDepression\r\nOxidative stress\r\nToxicity\r\nVitamin D(3)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Camargo A, Dalmagro AP, Rikel L, da Silva EB, Simão da Silva KAB, and Zeni ALB (2018) Cholecalciferol counteracts depressive-like behavior and oxidative stress induced by repeated corticosterone treatment in mice..

These issues highlight the need for better therapeutic agents that provide more efficacious and faster effects for the management of this disorder. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, is the prototype for novel glutamate-based antidepressants that has been shown to cause a rapid and sustained antidepressant effect even in severe refractory depressive patients. Considering the importance of these findings, several studies have been conducted to elucidate the molecular targets for ketamine's effect. In addition, efforts are under way to characterize ketamine-like drugs. This review focuses particularly on evidence that endogenous glutamatergic neuromodulators may be able to modulate mood and to elicit fast antidepressant responses. Among these molecules, agmatine and creatine stand out as those with more published evidence of similarities with ketamine, but guanosine and ascorbic acid have also provided promising results. The possibility that these neuromodulators and ketamine have common neurobiological mechanisms, mainly the ability to activate mechanistic target of rapamycin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling, and synthesis of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex and/or hippocampus is presented and discussed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Camargo A ; Rodrigues ALS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/2470547019858083 ","Keywords":"agmatine\r\nascorbic acid\r\ncreatine\r\nfast-acting antidepressant\r\nguanosine\r\nketamine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Camargo A, and Rodrigues ALS (2019) Novel Targets for Fast Antidepressant Responses: Possible Role of Endogenous Neuromodulators..

Notably, the deficiency of vitamin D(3) is considered a pandemic and has been postulated to enhance the risk of major depressive disorder (MDD). Therefore, this study aims to investigate the antidepressant-like effect of cholecalciferol in a mouse model of depression induced by corticosterone, and the possible role of glucocorticoid receptors (GR), NLRP3 and autophagic pathways in this effect. Corticosterone administration (20 mg/kg, p.o., for 21 days) significantly increased the immobility time and grooming latency, as well as reduced the total time spent grooming in mice subjected to the tail suspension test (TST) and splash test (ST), respectively. Importantly, these behavioral alterations were associated with reduced GR immunocontent in the hippocampus of mice. Conversely, the repeated administration of cholecalciferol (2.5 μg/kg, p.o.) in the last 7 days of corticosterone administration was effective to prevent the increased immobility time in the TST and the reduced time spent grooming in the ST, and partially abolished the increase in the grooming latency induced by corticosterone, suggesting its antidepressant-like effect. These behavioral effects were similar to those exerted by fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, p.o.). Moreover, the corticosterone-induced reduction on hippocampal GR immunocontent was not observed in mice treated with cholecalciferol. Additionally, cholecalciferol treatment per se reduced the immunocontent of NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins ASC, caspase-1, and TXNIP in the hippocampus of mice. No alterations on hippocampal immunocontent of the autophagic-related proteins phospho-mTORC1, beclin-1, and LC3A/B were observed following cholecalciferol treatment and/or corticosterone administration. Collectively, our results provide insights into the effects of cholecalciferol in depression-related behaviors that seem to be related, at least in part, to GR modulation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Camargo A ; Dalmagro AP ; Platt N ; F Rosado A; B Neis V; B Zeni AL; P Kaster M; S Rodrigues AL; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pbb.2020.172971 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/pharmacology\r\nBeclin-1/*metabolism\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nCholecalciferol/*pharmacology\r\nCorticosterone/*administration & dosage\r\nDepression/*prevention & control\r\nFluoxetine/pharmacology\r\nHippocampus/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/*metabolism\r\nMice\r\nMicrotubule-Associated Proteins/*metabolism\r\nReceptors, Glucocorticoid/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nCholecalciferol\r\nCorticosterone\r\nDepression\r\nGlucocorticoid receptor\r\nStress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Camargo A, Dalmagro AP, Platt N, F Rosado A, B Neis V, B Zeni AL, P Kaster M, and S Rodrigues AL (2020) Cholecalciferol abolishes depressive-like behavior and hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor impairment induced by chronic corticosterone administration in mice..

Subgroup analysis indicated that participants with higher baseline mood disturbance exhibited a significant 38 % (P = 0·029) decrease in total mood disturbance, as well as a 38 % (P = 0·048) decrease in fatigue, 31 % (P = 0·024) increase in vigour and a 34 % (P = 0·075) trend towards a decrease in depression, following supplementation with two kiwifruit/d. There was no effect of two kiwifruit/d on the mood scores of participants with lower baseline mood disturbance. Dietary intakes and body status of specific micronutrients indicated a significant increase in the participants' vitamin C intakes and corresponding plasma levels of the vitamin.

Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with an increased risk of mental health problems as well as individual responses to stress. Studies have discussed the relationship between low serum vitamin D concentrations and depressive symptoms, suggesting that maintaining adequate concentrations of serum vitamin D seems to have a protective effect against it. Vitamin D was found to contribute to improved serotonergic neurotransmission in the experimental model of depression by regulating serotonin metabolism. The signaling of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the active form of vitamin D, through vitamin D receptor (VDR) induces the expression of the gene of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), influences the expression of serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) as well as the levels of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), the enzyme responsible for serotonin catabolism. Vitamin D also presents a relevant link with chronobiological interplay, which could influence the development of depressive symptoms when unbalance between light-dark cycles occurs. In this Perspective, we discussed the significant role of vitamin D in the elevation of stress-related depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is suggested that vitamin D monitoring and, when deficiency is detected, supplementation could be considered as an important healthcare measure while lockdown and social isolation procedures last during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ceolin G ; Mano GPR ; Hames NS ; Antunes LDC ; Brietzke E ; Rieger DK ; Moreira JD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fnins.2021.670879 ","Keywords":"COVID-19\r\ncholecalciferol\r\ndepressive symptoms\r\npandemics\r\nsocial isolation\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ceolin G, Mano GPR, Hames NS, Antunes LDC, Brietzke E, Rieger DK, and Moreira JD (2021) Vitamin D, Depressive Symptoms, and Covid-19 Pandemic..

Despite being a well-studied disease with several established forms of treatment, its prevalence is increasing, especially among older adults. New forms of treatment and prevention are encouraged, and some researchers have been discussing the effects of vitamin D (VitD) on depression; however, the exact mechanism by which VitD exerts its effects is not yet conclusive. In this study, we aimed to discuss the possible mechanisms underlying the association between VitD and depression in older adults. Therefore, we conducted a systematic search of databases for indexed articles published until April 30, 2021. The primary focus was on both observational studies documenting the association between VitD and depression/depressive symptoms, and clinical trials documenting the effects of VitD supplementation on depression/depressive symptoms, especially in older adults. Based on pre-clinical, clinical, and observational studies, it is suggested that the maintenance of adequate VitD concentrations is an important issue, especially in older adults, which are a risk population for both VitD deficiency and depression. Nevertheless, it is necessary to carry out more studies using longitudinal approaches in low- and middle-income countries to develop a strong source of evidence to formulate guidelines and interventions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ceolin G ; Antunes LDC ; Moretti M ; Rieger DK ; Moreira JD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S0954422422000026 ","Keywords":"25-hydroxycholecalciferol\r\nAging\r\nClinical Trials\r\nDepression\r\nObservational Studies\r\nOlder Adults\r\nReview\r\nVitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ceolin G, Antunes LDC, Moretti M, Rieger DK, and Moreira JD (2022) VITAMIN D AND DEPRESSION IN OLDER ADULTS: LESSONS LEARNED FROM OBSERVATIONAL AND CLINICAL STUDIES..

Therefore, the present review aims at providing an overview of the available literature exploring the role of vitamin D in BD patients in different phases of the disease. METHODS: From a bibliographic research in PubMed until April 2020, we collected ten original studies that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. RESULTS: No significant differences in vitamin D levels between BD patients and other psychiatric disorders were found by most of the studies. In the majority of the studies, the average values of vitamin D in BD population were sub-threshold for vitamin D deficiency. Moreover, although an association between vitamin D levels and clinical symptomatology was observed in BD patients, it cannot be considered a specific marker of this disorder but a common characteristic shared with other psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. Finally, vitamin D supplementation was associated with a reduction in both depressive and manic symptoms. LIMITATIONS: Few studies with small and heterogeneous populations. Methodological heterogeneity in terms of vitamin D measurement and threshold. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that vitamin D status does not differ between BD and other psychiatric conditions. However, given the correlation between vitamin D levels and depressive or manic symptoms, we could hypothesize that an adequate vitamin D status could positively affect the mood balance thanks to its immunomodulatory activity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cereda G ; Enrico P ; Ciappolino V ; Delvecchio G ; Brambilla P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.039 ","Keywords":"*Bipolar Disorder/epidemiology\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/epidemiology\r\nHumans\r\nVitamin D\r\n*Vitamin D Deficiency/epidemiology\r\nVitamins\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nDepression\r\nMania\r\nMicronutrient\r\nVitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cereda G, Enrico P, Ciappolino V, Delvecchio G, and Brambilla P (2021) The role of vitamin D in bipolar disorder: Epidemiology and influence on disease activity..

RESULTS: The analysis covered 25 trials with a total of 7,534 participants and revealed an effect of vitamin D on negative emotion (Hedges' g = -0.4990, 95% CI [-0.8453, -0.1528], p = .0047, I(2) = 97.7%). Subgroup analysis showed that vitamin D had an effect on patients with major depressive disorder and on subjects with serum 25(OH)D levels ≤50 nmol/L. The pooled data from trials of vitamin D supplementation lasting ≥8 weeks and dosage ≤4,000 IU/day indicated that vitamin D had an effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation can reduce negative emotions. Patients with major depressive disorder and individuals with vitamin D deficiency are most likely to benefit from supplementation. But to interpret the results with high heterogeneity should still be cautious.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cheng YC ; Huang YC ; Huang WL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/da.23025 ","Keywords":"*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nEmotions\r\nHumans\r\nVitamin D\r\n*Vitamin D Deficiency/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nanxiety/anxiety disorders\r\ndepression\r\ndysthymic disorder\r\nmood disorders\r\npharmacotherapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cheng YC, Huang YC, and Huang WL (2020) The effect of vitamin D supplement on negative emotions: A systematic review and meta-analysis..

This scoping review characterized nutrition intervention research in mental disorders. A 3-category framework characterized nutrition interventions: Guide (e.g., counselling), Provide (e.g., food provisions), and Add (e.g., supplementation). Nutrition interventions were classified as single-component (e.g., Guide) or complex (e.g., Guide-Provide). Sixty-nine trials met inclusion criteria, 96% were randomized controlled trials. Most commonly diagnosed mental disorders were depressive disorder (i.e., persistent) or major depressive disorder (n = 39), schizophrenia (n = 17), and other psychotic disorders (n = 13). Few trials included patients with anxiety disorders (n = 2) or bipolar disorders (n = 3). Several trials (n = 15, 22%) assessed and implemented nutrition interventions to improve dietary patterns, of which 11 (73%) reported statistically significant and clinically important positive effects of nutrition interventions on mental disorders. The majority of the trials (n = 61, 90%) investigated supplementation, most commonly adding essential fatty acids, vitamins, or minerals. The majority (n = 48, 70%) reported either statistically significant or clinically important effect and 31 (51%) reported both. Though most interventions led to statistically significant improvements, trials were heterogeneous for targeted mental disorders, nutrition interventions, and outcomes assessed. Given considerable heterogeneity, further research from robust and clinically relevant trials is required to support high-quality health care with effective nutrition interventions. Novelty Future research on whole-diet interventions powered to detect changes in mental health outcomes as primary objectives is needed. Dietitians may be an opportunity to improve feasibility and efficacy of nutrition interventions for mental disorder patients. Dietitians may be of value to educate mental health practitioners on the importance of nutrition.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cherak SJ ; Fiest KM ; VanderSluis L ; Basualdo-Hammond C ; Lorenzetti DL ; Buhler S ; Stadnyk J ; Driedger L ; Hards L ; Gramlich L ; Fenton TR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1139/apnm-2019-0683 ","Keywords":"Counseling/*methods\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFood Supply/*methods\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/*therapy\r\nNutrition Therapy/*methods\r\ncounseling\r\ncounselling\r\nessais\r\nexamen exploratoire\r\nmental health\r\nnutrition\r\npsychiatrie\r\npsychiatry\r\nsanté mentale\r\nscoping review\r\nsupplementation\r\nsupplémentation\r\ntrials","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cherak SJ, Fiest KM, VanderSluis L, Basualdo-Hammond C, Lorenzetti DL, Buhler S, Stadnyk J, Driedger L, Hards L, Gramlich L, and Fenton TR (2020) Nutrition interventions in populations with mental health conditions: a scoping review..

Although many factors determine the mental health of an individual, diet has been gaining popularity as a key modifiable factor in the prevention and management of depression. Nutritional Psychiatry is an emerging field where researchers suggest that the food we consume influences our mental well-being. AIM: This review aims to explore the significance of diet, nutrient deficiencies, imbalances, and unhealthy dietary patterns in the prevention and management of unipolar depression or major depressive disorder among adolescents. METHODS: Electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and MEDLINE were searched using keywords such as \"mental health,\" \"depression,\" \"adolescents,\" \"diet,\" \"dietary pattern,\" and pertinent articles (N = 68) were retrieved and reviewed. RESULTS: The Mediterranean and traditional diets rich in complex carbohydrates, omega-3 fatty acids, B-group vitamins and several amino acids have shown negative correlation with the incidence of depression. On the other hand, Western dietary patterns (sweetened beverages, processed/ junk food, and foods rich in saturated fatty acids), along with low consumption of fruits and vegetables have been linked to an increased risk of depression among adolescents. CONCLUSION: Dietary modification can prove to be a cost-effective strategy for the prevention and treatment of depression among adolescents. Diet and nutrition need to be recognized as key modifiable targets for the prevention of mental disorders and nutritional medicine should be considered as an integral part of psychiatric treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chopra C ; Mandalika S ; Kinger N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0260106020980532 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\n*Depression/prevention & control\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major\r\nDiet\r\nHumans\r\nMental Health\r\nVegetables\r\nDepression\r\nMediterranean diet\r\nWestern diet\r\nadolescents\r\ndietary\r\nmental health\r\nnutrition status\r\npattern\r\nprocessed foods\r\nunhealthy diet","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chopra C, Mandalika S, and Kinger N (2021) Does diet play a role in the prevention and management of depression among adolescents?

However, it has multiple roles in human health, including neuromuscular and immune modulation. Recently, its deficiency is increasingly implicated in many diseases. This discovery has led both popular culture and research to find ways that vitamin D can either treat or prevent many diseases. Since vitamin D not only affects the expression of many genes, but also has intra-individual pharmacokinetic variation, a simplistic cause and effect between vitamin D deficiency and illnesses should not be expected. Older adults pose a challenge not only because diseases become more prevalent with ageing, but they also are often complicated with other comorbidities. This article reviews the link of vitamin D deficiency and the associated medical conditions in middle aged and older adults.

Our objective was to investigate the prospective association of adherence to dietary guidelines at midlife, measured by the French Programme National Nutrition Santé-Guideline Score (PNNS-GS), with chronic or recurrent depressive symptoms. The association between the PNNS-GS and chronic or recurrent depressive symptoms was evaluated among participants of the French Supplémentation en Vitamines et Minéraux AntioXydants (SU.VI.MAX) cohort with available data on the PNNS-GS at baseline (1994-1996) and on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) in 1996-1997 and follow-up (2007-2009) (n=3328). Chronic or recurrent depressive symptoms were defined by a CES-D score ≥16 at baseline and follow-up. Odds ratios (OR) and 95%-confidence intervals (95%-CI) were estimated across quartiles (Q) of the PNNS-GS, using logistic regression models. In our study, 10.1% of the participants (n=335) had chronic or recurrent depressive symptoms. After adjustment for potential confounders, the PNNS-GS was inversely associated with chronic or recurrent depressive symptoms: OR(Q4 vs. Q1): 0.42 (95%-CI: 0.29, 0.60). Modelling the PNNS-GS as a continuous variable yielded similar results: OR for a 1-point increment in the PNNS-GS: 0.86 (95%-CI: 0.80, 0.92). In conclusion, higher adherence to French dietary guidelines at midlife was associated with a lower rate of chronic or recurrent depressive symptoms, which suggests that these recommendations may be highly relevant, not only to avoid chronic diseases, but also for the overall well-being.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Collin C ; Assmann KE ; Andreeva VA ; Lemogne C ; Hercberg S ; Galan P ; Kesse-Guyot E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ypmed.2016.09.001 ","Keywords":"Depression/*prevention & control/psychology\r\nDiet/*standards\r\nFemale\r\nFrance\r\nGuideline Adherence/*standards\r\nHealth Behavior\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Nutrition Policy\r\nProspective Studies\r\n*Protective Factors\r\nDepression\r\nDiet, food, and nutrition\r\nNutrition guidelines","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Collin C, Assmann KE, Andreeva VA, Lemogne C, Hercberg S, Galan P, and Kesse-Guyot E (2016) Adherence to dietary guidelines as a protective factor against chronic or recurrent depressive symptoms in the French SU.VI.MAX cohort..

Self-report outcome measures were depressive symptoms and anxiety measured pre- and post-intervention, and daily negative and positive mood, vitality, flourishing, and flourishing behaviors (curiosity, creativity, motivation) assessed nightly using a smartphone survey. Vitamin C and carotenoids were measured from blood samples pre- and post-intervention, and psychological expectancies about the benefits of FV were measured post-intervention to test as mediators of psychological change. Only participants in the FVI condition showed improvements to their psychological well-being with increases in vitality, flourishing, and motivation across the 14-days relative to the other groups. No changes were found for depressive symptoms, anxiety, or mood. Intervention benefits were not mediated by vitamin C, carotenoids, or psychological expectancies. We conclude that providing young adults with high-quality FV, rather than reminding them to eat more FV (with a voucher to purchase FV), resulted in significant short-term improvements to their psychological well-being. These results provide initial proof-of-concept that giving young adults fresh fruit and vegetables to eat can have psychological benefits even over a brief period of time.

The present investigation was designed to investigate whether the co-administration of folic acid would enhance the antidepressant action of fluoxetine. METHODS: 127 patients were randomly assigned to receive either 500 microg folic acid or an identical looking placebo in addition to 20 mg fluoxetine daily. All patients met the DSM-III-R criteria for major depression and had a baseline Hamilton Rating Scale (17 item version) score for depression of 20 or more. Baseline and 10-week estimations of plasma folate and homocysteine were carried out. RESULTS: Patients receiving folate showed a significant increase in plasma folate. This was less in men than in women. Plasma homocysteine was significantly decreased in women by 20.6%, but there was no significant change in men. Overall there was a significantly greater improvement in the fluoxetine plus folic acid group. This was confined to women where the mean Hamilton Rating Scale score on completion was 6.8 (S.D. 4. 1) in the fluoxetine plus folate group, as compared to 11.7 (S.D. 6. 7) in the fluoxetine plus placebo group (P<0.001).A percentage of 93. 9 of women, who received the folic acid supplement, showed a good response (>50% reduction in score) as compared to 61.1% of women who received placebo supplement (P<0.005). Eight (12.9%) patients in the fluoxetine plus folic acid group reported symptoms possibly or probably related to medication, whereas in the fluoxetine plus placebo group 19 (29.7%) patients reported such symptoms (P<0.05). LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Folic acid is a simple method of greatly improving the antidepressant action of fluoxetine and probably other antidepressants. Folic acid should be given in doses sufficient to decrease plasma homocysteine. Men require a higher dose of folic acid to achieve this than women, but more work is required to ascertain the optimum dose of folic acid.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Coppen A ; Bailey J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0165-0327(00)00153-1 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/blood/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nFluoxetine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nFolic Acid/administration & dosage/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nHomocysteine/blood\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSex Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin B 12/blood","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Coppen A, and Bailey J (2000) Enhancement of the antidepressant action of fluoxetine by folic acid: a randomised, placebo controlled trial..

Both low folate and low vitamin B12 status have been found in studies of depressive patients, and an association between depression and low levels of the two vitamins is found in studies of the general population. Low plasma or serum folate has also been found in patients with recurrent mood disorders treated by lithium. A link between depression and low folate has similarly been found in patients with alcoholism. It is interesting to note that Hong Kong and Taiwan populations with traditional Chinese diets (rich in folate), including patients with major depression, have high serum folate concentrations. However, these countries have very low life time rates of major depression. Low folate levels are furthermore linked to a poor response to antidepressants, and treatment with folic acid is shown to improve response to antidepressants. A recent study also suggests that high vitamin B12 status may be associated with better treatment outcome. Folate and vitamin B12 are major determinants of one-carbon metabolism, in which S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is formed. SAM donates methyl groups that are crucial for neurological function. Increased plasma homocysteine is a functional marker of both folate and vitamin B12 deficiency. Increased homocysteine levels are found in depressive patients. In a large population study from Norway increased plasma homocysteine was associated with increased risk of depression but not anxiety. There is now substantial evidence of a common decrease in serum/red blood cell folate, serum vitamin B12 and an increase in plasma homocysteine in depression. Furthermore, the MTHFR C677T polymorphism that impairs the homocysteine metabolism is shown to be overrepresented among depressive patients, which strengthens the association. On the basis of current data, we suggest that oral doses of both folic acid (800 microg daily) and vitamin B12 (1 mg daily) should be tried to improve treatment outcome in depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Coppen A ; Bolander-Gouaille C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0269881105048899 ","Keywords":"Brain/physiopathology\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology/psychology\r\nFolic Acid/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nFolic Acid Deficiency/psychology\r\nHomocysteine/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nMethylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/metabolism\r\nNutritional Status\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin B 12/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nVitamin B 12 Deficiency/psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Coppen A, and Bolander-Gouaille C (2005) Treatment of depression: time to consider folic acid and vitamin B12..

Studies have shown that cholecalciferol supplementation can lead to attenuation of the depressive state; however, the biochemical mechanisms involved in the relationship between cholecalciferol and depression are not very well known. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the administration of cholecalciferol on behavioral parameters (tail suspension test (TST), open field test (OFT), splash test (ST)) and redox state (dichlorofluorescein (DCF)) in adult female Swiss mice subjected to a model of depression induced by chronic corticosterone treatment. Corticosterone (20 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered once a day for 21 days. For investigation of the antidepressant-like effect, cholecalciferol (100 IU/kg) or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, positive control) was administered p.o. within the last 7 days of corticosterone administration. After the treatments, the behavioral tests and biochemical analyses in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of the rodent samples were performed. Animals submitted to repeated corticosterone administration showed a depressive-like behavior, evidenced by a significant increase in the immobility time in the TST, which was significantly reduced by the administration of cholecalciferol or fluoxetine. In addition, the groups treated with cholecalciferol and fluoxetine showed a significant decrease in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the hippocampus. These results show that cholecalciferol, similar to fluoxetine, has a potential antidepressant-like effect, which may be related to the lower ROS production.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"da Silva Souza SV; da Rosa PB ; Neis VB ; Moreira JD ; Rodrigues ALS ; Moretti M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00210-019-01714-2 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nCholecalciferol/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nCorticosterone\r\nDepression/chemically induced/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFemale\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nMice\r\nReactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism\r\nCorticosterone\r\nDepression\r\nHippocampus\r\nROS\r\nRedox state\r\nVitamin D3","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"da Silva Souza SV, da Rosa PB, Neis VB, Moreira JD, Rodrigues ALS, and Moretti M (2020) Effects of cholecalciferol on behavior and production of reactive oxygen species in female mice subjected to corticosterone-induced model of depression..

Subclinical levels of folate inadequacy can have significant negative impacts on health in older individuals. RECENT FINDINGS: Serum and red blood cell folate levels are associated with depression in younger individuals, but the relationship is less clear in older people. However, folate status does predict response to antidepressant treatment in older individuals. Cognitive decline and some forms of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, are associated with lower folate levels. Supplementation with folic acid can provide cognitive benefits in some circumstances. Folic acid supplementation is generally regarded as safe; however, there remains some concern that high levels of folic acid may exacerbate the neurological consequences of a vitamin B12 deficiency. SUMMARY: Evidence for the role of folate in depression and dementia in the aged is increasing, although there remains much about mechanisms to be determined.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"D'Anci KE ; Rosenberg IH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00075197-200411000-00011 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nBrain/drug effects/*physiology\r\nCognition/*drug effects\r\nDementia/blood\r\nDepression/blood\r\nErythrocytes/chemistry\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/*blood/metabolism/physiology\r\nFolic Acid Deficiency/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nVitamin B 12 Deficiency/metabolism/physiopathology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"D'Anci KE, and Rosenberg IH (2004) Folate and brain function in the elderly..

Sixty patients (52.2%) were considered treatment-resistant and entered the 6-week open-label aripiprazole, olanzapine, or L-methyl folate addition phase; Patients showed a significant improvement over 6-week study period in olanzapine and aripiprazole group as measured by YBOCS total score (p < 0.001) while there was no change in the L-methyl folate group at the end as compared with baseline (p = 0.150). Clinical Global Impression-Severity decreased from 4.90 to 2.90 in olanzapine and aripiprazole group at the end of 6 weeks while there was no change in the L-methyl folate group. The CGI-I was significant in the olanzapine and aripiprazole group (p < 0.001) while it was insignificant in the L-methyl folate group (p = 0.088).

The patient population was predominantly female (80%), Caucasian (90%), with an average of three comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, and failures of three psychotropic medications before starting LM. The majority of patients (80%) had a single mutation among the two methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene variants evaluated (50% A1298 AC; 30% C677 CT), indicating reduced MTHFR activity. Eighty percent of patients demonstrated improvement in depression, anxiety, and irritability. Overall, LM was well tolerated. These cases suggest that LM as an adjunct to antidepressant treatment may be a safe and effective strategy for managing treatment-resistant depression in pediatric patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dartois LL ; Stutzman DL ; Morrow M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1089/cap.2019.0006 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAminohydrolases/genetics\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*drug therapy\r\n*Drug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nFormate-Tetrahydrofolate Ligase/genetics\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethylenetetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase (NADP)/genetics\r\nMultienzyme Complexes/genetics\r\nMutation/genetics\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nTetrahydrofolates/*therapeutic use\r\ngene\r\nL-methylfolate\r\nantidepressant augmentation\r\nfolate\r\npediatric\r\ntreatment-resistant depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dartois LL, Stutzman DL, and Morrow M (2019) L-methylfolate Augmentation to Antidepressants for Adolescents with Treatment-Resistant Depression: A Case Series..

Folic acid supplementation improves cognitive function. Folic acid enhances the plasma concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). EPA, DHA, and arachidonic acid (AA) are of benefit in dementia and Alzheimer's disease by up-regulating gene expression concerned with neurogenesis, neurotransmission and connectivity, improving endothelial nitric oxide (eNO) generation, enhancing brain acetylcholine levels, and suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. EPA, DHA, and AA also form precursors to anti-inflammatory compounds such as lipoxins, resolvins, and neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) that protect neurons from the cytotoxic action of various noxious stimuli. Furthermore, various neurotrophins and statins enhance the formation of NPD1 and thus, protect neurons from oxidative stress and prevent neuronal apoptosis Folic acid improves eNO generation, enhances plasma levels of EPA/DHA and thus, could augment the formation of NPD1.

METHOD: A cross-sectional survey using 3-day food records was carried out in 97 adults with bipolar or major depressive disorder to compare nutrient intakes with Dietary Reference Intakes and British Columbia Nutrition Survey (BCNS) data. Blood levels of selected nutrients were compared to reference ranges. Bivariate and multivariate analyses examined the effects of sociodemographic and clinical variables on nutrient intakes. RESULTS: The average age of respondents was 46 (±13) years; most were women (n = 69) who had less than a university degree (n = 60) and whose incomes were in the government-defined lower range (n = 39). Compared with the BCNS, a larger proportion of the sample was below the estimated average requirement for thiamin (26% vs 8%), riboflavin (21% vs 4%), folate (64% vs 27%), phosphorous (12% vs 1%), and zinc (39% vs 15%; all P < 0.0001), as well as vitamin B(6) (25% vs 16%) and vitamin B(12) (27% vs 8%; both P < 0.05). Combined intakes of food and supplements helped reduce the prevalence of inadequacy; however, with supplementation, the proportion of participants exceeding the tolerable upper intake levels for niacin, vitamin B(6), folate, vitamin C, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc ranged from 1%-8%. Income, relationship status, age, gender, and caloric intake were associated with intakes of many nutrients. Types of medications were associated with nutrient intakes, as lower intakes of thiamin and phosphorous (P < 0.05) were found with antidepressant use, higher calcium and iron intakes (P < 0.05) were associated with antianxiety medication use, and magnesium intakes were increased with mood stabilizers (regression coefficient = 52.61, P < 0.05, 95% confidence interval = 0.74 to 104.48). CONCLUSIONS: Adults with mood disorders are at risk for many nutrient inadequacies, as well as occasional excesses; social, demographic, and clinical factors may affect their nutrient intakes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Davison KM ; Kaplan BJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/07315724.2011.10720001 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBipolar Disorder/complications/*physiopathology\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/complications/*physiopathology\r\nDiet Surveys\r\nDietary Supplements\r\n*Energy Intake\r\n*Feeding Behavior\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLife Style\r\nLinear Models\r\nMale\r\nMalnutrition/complications/*epidemiology/physiopathology\r\nMicronutrients/*administration & dosage/blood/deficiency\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNutritional Requirements\r\nNutritional Status\r\nPrevalence\r\nSocioeconomic Factors\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Davison KM, and Kaplan BJ (2011) Vitamin and mineral intakes in adults with mood disorders: comparisons to nutrition standards and associations with sociodemographic and clinical variables..

METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted of the intake of major (that is, carbohydrates, fat, and protein) and minor (that is, vitamins and minerals) nutrients (from 3-day food records and a Food Frequency Questionnaire), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores, and symptoms of depression and mania (the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Young Mania Rating Scale) in 97 community-based adults with mood disorders whose diagnoses were confirmed with structured interviews. RESULTS: Significant correlations were found between GAF scores and energy (kilocalories), carbohydrates, fibre, total fat, linoleic acid, riboflavin, niacin, folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and iron (all P values < 0.05), as well as magnesium (r = 0.41, P < 0.001) and zinc (r = 0.35, P < 0.001). Though modest in magnitude, the pattern of correlations was consistent, indicating higher levels of mental function associated with a higher intake of nutrients. Depression and mania scores, which were generally mild or moderate, did not individually show consistent patterns. When dietary supplement use was added to nutrient intakes from food, GAF scores remained positively correlated (P < 0.05) with all dietary minerals. CONCLUSION: This detailed analysis in a clinically diagnosed sample was consistent with prior epidemiologic surveys, revealing an association between higher levels of nutrient intakes and better mental health. Nutrient intakes warrant further consideration in the treatment of people with mood disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Davison KM ; Kaplan BJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/070674371205700205 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnalysis of Variance\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDiet/*psychology/statistics & numerical data\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLinear Models\r\nMale\r\nMood Disorders/*diagnosis/diet therapy\r\n*Nutrition Assessment\r\n*Nutritional Requirements","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Davison KM, and Kaplan BJ (2012) Nutrient intakes are correlated with overall psychiatric functioning in adults with mood disorders..

This study examined depression and socio-economic, health, immigration and nutrition-related factors in older adults. METHODS: Using weighted comprehensive cohort data from the baseline Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (n = 27,162) of adults aged 45-85, gender-specific binary logistic regression was conducted with the cross-sectional data using the following variables: 1) Depression (outcome) measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression (CESD-10) rating scale; 2) Immigration status: native-born, recent and mid-term (< 20 years), and long-term immigrants (≥20 years); and 3) covariates: socioeconomic status, physical health (e.g., multi-morbidity), health behavior (e.g., substance use), over-nutrition (e.g., anthropometrics), under-nutrition (e.g., nutrition risk), and dietary intake. RESULTS: The sample respondents were mainly Canadian-born (82.6%), women (50.6%), 56-65 years (58.9%), earning between C$50,000-99,999 (33.2%), and in a relationship (69.4%). When compared to Canadian-born residents, recent, mid-term (< 20 years), and longer-term (≥ 20 years) immigrant women were more likely to report depression and this relationship was robust to adjustments for 32 covariates (adjusted ORs = 1.19, 2.54, respectively, p < 0.001). For women, not completing secondary school (OR = 1.23, p < 0.05), stage 1 hypertension (OR = 1.31, p < 0.001), chronic pain (OR = 1.79, p < 0.001), low fruit/vegetable intakes (OR = 1.33, p < 0.05), and fruit juice (OR = 1.80, p < 0.001), chocolate (ORs = 1.15-1.66, p's < 0.05), or salty snack (OR = 1.19, p < 0.05) consumption were associated with depression. For all participants, lower grip strength (OR = 1.25, p < 0.001) and high nutritional risk (OR = 2.24, p < 0.001) were associated with depression. For men, being in a relationship (OR = 0.62, p < 0.001), completing post-secondary education (OR = 0.82, p < 0.05), higher fat (ORs = 0.67-83, p's < 0.05) and omega-3 egg intake (OR = 0.86, p < 0.05) as well as moderate intakes of fruits/vegetables and calcium/high vitamin D sources (ORs = 0.71-0.743, p's < 0.05) predicted a lower likelihood of depression. For men, chronic conditions (ORs = 1.36-3.65, p's < 0.001), chronic pain (OR = 1.86, p < 0.001), smoking (OR = 1.17, p < 0.001), or chocolate consumption (ORs = 1.14-1.72, p's < 0.05) predicted a higher likelihood of depression. CONCLUSIONS: The odds of developing depression were highest among immigrant women. Depression in middle-aged and older adults is also associated with socioeconomic, physical, and nutritional factors and the relationships differ by sex. These results provide insights for mental health interventions specific to adults aged 45-85.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Davison KM ; Lung Y ; Lin SL ; Tong H ; Kobayashi KM ; Fuller-Thomson E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12888-019-2309-y ","Keywords":"Age Factors\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAging/*psychology\r\nCanada/epidemiology\r\nCohort Studies\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/*epidemiology\r\nDiet/*statistics & numerical data\r\nEmigrants and Immigrants/*statistics & numerical data\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLogistic Models\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSex Factors\r\nSocial Class\r\nCLSA\r\nOlder adults\r\ndepression\r\ndeterminants of health\r\nimmigration\r\nmiddle-age\r\nnutrition","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Davison KM, Lung Y, Lin SL, Tong H, Kobayashi KM, and Fuller-Thomson E (2019) Depression in middle and older adulthood: the role of immigration, nutrition, and other determinants of health in the Canadian longitudinal study on aging..

This decrease was higher in L-(+)-ascorbic acid - than in salbutamol-treated mice. Rearing behavior was significantly increased only in salbutamol-treated animals. In animals treated chronically (once a day for 15 days) the depression of salbutamol-induced ambulation was more marked than in mice treated acutely. This decrease was partially reversed by L-(+)-ascorbic acid treatment. With respect to rearing scores, a significant increase was found after salbutamol and L-(+)-ascorbic acid administered alone or in combination. In conclusion, these experiments show that salbutamol induces a direct effect on behavior, that is to reduce motor activity, being the reduction more marked after chronic treatment. The association of the beta 2-agonist with L-(+)-ascorbic acid can attenuate some of the depressant effects of chronic salbutamol administration on behavior.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"de Angelis L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Albuterol/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nAnimals\r\nAscorbic Acid/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nDepression, Chemical\r\nFemale\r\nMice","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"de Angelis L (1987) Behavioral effects of salbutamol and/or L-(+)-ascorbic acid in the mouse after single and multiple dosing..

Studies have suggested that oxidative stress may trigger neuropsychological disorders. Antioxidants may play an important therapeutic role in combating the damage caused by oxidative stress in individuals that suffer from anxiety. In this context, it was hypothesized that oral vitamin C supplementation would reduce anxiety. However, few up to date studies have evaluated the consequences of oral vitamin C supplementation on anxiety in humans. The present study examined the effects of oral vitamin C supplements in 42 high school students, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The students were given either vitamin C (500 mg day(-1)) or placebo. Plasma concentrations of vitamin C and blood pressure were measured before the intervention and then one day after the intervention. Anxiety levels were evaluated for each student before and after 14 days following supplementation with the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Results showed that vitamin C reduced anxiety levels and led to higher plasma vitamin C concentration compared to the placebo. The mean heart rates were also significantly different between vitamin C group and placebo control group. Present study results not only provide evidence that vitamin C plays an important therapeutic role for anxiety but also point a possible use for antioxidants in the prevention or reduction of anxiety. This suggests that a diet rich in vitamin C may be an effective adjunct to medical and psychological treatment of anxiety and improve academic performance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"de Oliveira IJ ; de Souza VV ; Motta V ; Da-Silva SL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3923/pjbs.2015.11.18 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAdolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAnti-Anxiety Agents/*administration & dosage/blood\r\nAntioxidants/*administration & dosage\r\nAnxiety/blood/diagnosis/physiopathology/*prevention & control/psychology\r\nAscorbic Acid/*administration & dosage/blood\r\nBlood Pressure/drug effects\r\nBrazil\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHeart Rate/drug effects\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nStudents/*psychology\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"de Oliveira IJ, de Souza VV, Motta V, and Da-Silva SL (2015) Effects of Oral Vitamin C Supplementation on Anxiety in Students: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial..

Forty-four women with an average age of 32 years took part in the study. Each woman was randomly assigned, according to a Latin square design, to take consecutively all four of the following treatments daily for one menstrual cycle: (1) 200 mg Mg, (2) 50 mg vitamin B6, (3) 200 mg Mg + 50 mg vitamin B6 and (4) placebo. Throughout the study, each volunteer kept a daily record of symptoms using a 5-point ordinal scale in a menstrual diary of 30 symptoms. Symptoms were grouped into six categories: anxiety, craving, depression, hydration, other, and total. Urinary magnesium output for 24 hours was estimated using the Mg/creatinine concentration ratio. ANOVA showed no overall difference between individual treatments, but predefined treatment comparisons using factorial contrasts in ANOVA showed a significant effect of 200 mg/day Mg + 50 mg/day vitamin B6 on reducing anxiety-related premenstrual symptoms (nervous tension, mood swings, irritability, or anxiety) (p = 0.040). Urinary Mg output was not affected by treatment. A small synergistic effect of a daily dietary supplementation with a combination of Mg + vitamin B6 in the reduction of mild premenstrual anxiety-related symptoms was demonstrated during treatment of 44 women for one menstrual cycle. In view of the modest effect found, further studies are needed before making general recommendations for the treatment of premenstrual symptoms.

A survey of 7,970 U.S. residents aged 15 to 39 years found a high prevalence of low VDL, particularly in women, non-Hispanic blacks, and people who had current depression, had higher body mass index, or were living in urban areas.1 Thus, I read with interest the recent retrospective chart review by Leedahl et al.,2 which reported no correlation between VDL and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score. Unfortunately, the data were divided and analyzed based on arbitrary groupings of VDL ranges rather than as a continuous variable, which may have attenuated the association. Furthermore, they included all psychiatric inpatients regardless of admitting diagnosis, rather than focusing on unipolar depression, which may have confounded the findings.\n\nA 2013 study of 1,892 patients aged 18 to 65 years compared with 484 healthy controls found that VDL was inversely associated with current depression severity.3 In a 2010 prospective study (not discussed by Leedahl et al.) of 7,358 cardiovascular patients, average age of 73 years, with no previous depression diagnosis, followed-up for an average of 1.07 years, low VDL was a statistically significant predictor of a subsequent depression diagnosis.4 The risk of depression was almost 3-fold in patients with VDL <15 ng/mL, whereas patients with VDL >50 ng/mL had the least risk. The risk stratification at VDL 50 ng/mL raises the question that perhaps in the case of depression, conventional definitions of hypovitaminosis D are too limiting.\n\nAlthough association between VDL and depression merits further research, there have been several additional studies examining supplementation with vitamin D that were not mentioned by Leedahl et al. One study of 120 patients with low VDL and high Beck Depression Inventory II score randomly assigned to a single intramuscular injection of vitamin D 300,000 IU, 150,000 IU, or no injection, found significant improvement in Beck Depression Inventory scores in the 300,000 IU injection group at 3-month follow-up.5 A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 42 patients with major depression assigned to fluoxetine + placebo vs fluoxetine + vitamin D3 1,500 IU daily for 8 weeks found significantly more reductions in depression severity on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Beck Depression Inventory in the vitamin D intervention group after 4 weeks.6 On the contrary, a recent randomized clinical trial of 230 patients with low VDL randomized to either vitamin D3 40,000 IU weekly or placebo for 6 months reported no significant improvement in depressive symptoms.7\n\nThe following suggested guidelines for VDL assessment and treatment are proposed: obtain a VDL in patients with current depression not remitted with conventional psychiatric treatment, particularly in those with darker complexion, higher body mass index, age >65 years, and additional symptoms of myalgia/arthralgia, mood dysregulation/irritability, and insomnia/daytime somnolence. Treatment with either vitamin D2 50,000 IU weekly or vitamin D3 5,000 IU daily should be initiated in patients with VDL<30 ng/mL, but also clinically considered in depressed patients with VDL<50 ng/mL, provided there are no contraindications to supplementation. Patients with high risk of depression relapse may be advised to maintain VDL >50 ng/mL.\n\nDisclosure: The author disclosed no proprietary or commercial interest in any product mentioned or concept discussed in this article.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Denysenko L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.psym.2013.06.014 ","Keywords":"Cognition Disorders/*epidemiology\r\nDepression/*epidemiology\r\nFemale\r\n*Hospitals, Psychiatric\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nVitamin D/*therapeutic use\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/*epidemiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Denysenko L (2014) Is \"D\" for depression?.

Novel therapies are, therefore, required. It was shown by recent preclinical and clinical studies that the dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission might be involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. Furthermore, neuroimmune alterations could have a significant role in the pathogenesis of MDD. Vitamin D is a neurosteroid hormone essential for several metabolic processes, immune responses, and for regulating neurotrophic-neuroprotective processes, neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Recent studies have also shown Vitamin D deficiency in patients with severe psychiatric disorders, including MDD. Lately, clinical studies have shown the neuroprotective action of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) through the modulation of inflammatory pathways and via the modulation of synaptic release of glutamate in cortico-subcortical brain regions; the cysteine-glutamate antiporter. This paper reviews the therapeutic use of Vitamin D and NAC and among individuals with refractory MDD to the first- line pharmacological interventions, reviewing the clinical studies published in the last decade. A detailed summary of the current evidence in this area aims to better inform psychiatrists and general practitioners on the potential benefits of Vitamin D and NAC supplementation for this disorder. Nutraceutical supplementation with Vitamin D and NAC in treatment-resistant MDD patients may be important not only for improving depressive clinical manifestations but also for their safety and tolerability profile. This is of great interest, especially considering the need for treating special populations affected by MDD, such as youngsters and elders. Finally, the nutraceutical approach represents a good choice, considering its better compliance by the patients compared to traditional psychopharmacological treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"di Michele F ; Talamo A ; Niolu C ; Siracusano A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1381612826666200406090051 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine\r\nAged\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\nVitamin D\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nN-acetyl cysteine\r\nglutamate\r\ninflammation\r\nnutraceutical supplementation\r\nvitamin D.","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"di Michele F, Talamo A, Niolu C, and Siracusano A (2020) Vitamin D and N-Acetyl Cysteine Supplementation in Treatment-Resistant Depressive Disorder Patients: A General Review..

This meta-analysis of observational study was therefore employed to clarify the issue further. METHODS: An extensive literature review (PubMed, Web of Science and Embase) was performed in January 2022 to identify the observational studies on the associations of dietary vitamin C and E intake with depression. The pooled relative risk (RR) of depression for the highest versus lowest dietary vitamin C and E intake category, and the weighted mean difference (WMD) of dietary vitamin C and E intake for depression versus control subjects, were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 25 observational studies (91966 participants) were included in this meta-analysis. The overall multi-variable adjusted RR demonstrated that dietary vitamin C intake was inversely associated with depression (RR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.91; P = 0.005). In addition, the combined WMD showed that the dietary vitamin C intake in depression was lower than that in control subjects (WMD = -11.58, 95% CI: -14.88 to -8.29; P < 0.001). Similarly, the overall multi-variable adjusted RR demonstrated that dietary vitamin E intake was negatively associated with depression (RR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.72 to 0.98; P = 0.02). Moreover, the combined WMD showed that the dietary vitamin E intake in depression was also lower than that in control subjects (WMD = -0.71, 95% CI: -1.07 to -0.34; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that both dietary vitamin C and E intake is inversely associated with depression. However, due to the limited evidence, more well-designed prospective cohort studies are still needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ding J ; Zhang Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fnut.2022.857823 ","Keywords":"depression\r\ndietary vitamin C\r\ndietary vitamin E\r\nmeta-analysis\r\nobservational studies","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ding J, and Zhang Y (2022) Associations of Dietary Vitamin C and E Intake With Depression.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study included 60 patients diagnosed with depression, with mild or moderate depressive symptoms, randomly allocated into two groups. The study group was treated with SAMe-vitamin B complex while the control group was administered a placebo, once daily for three months. The severity of depressive symptoms was measured by the Hamilton Depression rating scale (HAMD17). We measured the symptoms' severity with the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S), and the improvement or worsening after treatment with the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I). RESULTS: The mean HAMD17 score at zero point refers to moderate depressive symptoms in both groups. We found a statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding the mean HAMD17 and CGI-S scores at three months (p <0.001) and a significant difference within the study group without an influence by the age or gender. Mean CGI-I score in the study group at three months showed minimally or much improvement while no change or minimal worsening was observed in the control group with significant differences between the groups (p <0.001).

Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: control, model, paroxetine (P), zinc + folic acid (ZnY), and zinc + folic acid + paroxetine (ZnYP) groups. Rat models of depression were established by chronic mild unpredictable stress for three weeks. These rats were then treated with different interventions for four weeks and the sucrose preference test was then performed to observe changes in rats' behavior. An HPLC-electrochemical method was used to detect the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) in the frontal cortex. qRT-PCR was employed to detect the mRNA levels of tyrosine kinase receptor B (Trk B) and N-methyl-D-aspartate acid (NMDA) in the frontal cortex; Western blotting was used to detect the protein levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the frontal cortex. The results showed that compared with the model group, sucrose consumption, 5-HT, NE and DA levels were significantly increased in the ZnY group (P < 0.05). Also the mRNA levels of Trk B and NMDA were significantly increased in the ZnY group compared with the model group (P < 0.001). No significant up-regulation of BDNF was observed in the ZnY group. We conclude that combined administration of zinc and folic acid can improve the symptoms of depression-model rats, and its mechanism is related to increased levels of 5-HT, DA and NE in the brain, and to the up-regulation of Trk B and NMDA.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dou M ; Gong A ; Liang H ; Wang Q ; Wu Y ; Ma A ; Han L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neulet.2018.07.036 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrain/drug effects/metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/*metabolism/psychology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFolic Acid/*administration & dosage\r\nMale\r\nN-Methylaspartate/*metabolism\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nReceptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism\r\nUp-Regulation/drug effects/physiology\r\nZinc/*administration & dosage\r\n5-hydroxytryptamine\r\nDepression\r\nFolic acid\r\nN-methyl-D-aspartate acid\r\nTyrosine kinase receptor B\r\nZinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dou M, Gong A, Liang H, Wang Q, Wu Y, Ma A, and Han L (2018) Improvement of symptoms in a rat model of depression through combined zinc and folic acid administration via up-regulation of the Trk B and NMDA..

There are no universal approaches across all childbearing women that have proven to be preventative for PPD, so it is hoped that dietary and/or hormonal interventions will be developed. There are some effective preventative approaches for PPD, such as psychotherapy and medical management, for the highest risk cases, like when there is a past history of a major depressive episode. The purpose is to review studies that assess dietary and hormonal interventions for prevention of PPD and/or postpartum blues, a high-risk state for PPD. Studies that assess dietary and hormonal interventions for prevention of PPD which included a comparison group were reviewed, including omega-3 fatty acids, mineral and vitamin supplements, amino acid combinations, allopregnanolone, progesterone, and thyroxine. Presently, development of dietary supplements and hormonal products for prevention of PPD is at an early stage with most trials showing results that are either preliminary, not definitive, trend level or variable across studies. Even so, a few directions are not recommended for further investigation such as progesterone and thyroxine. On the other hand, studies of allopregnanolone for prophylaxis of PPD are needed. Also, given the number of trend level findings and the multifactorial etiology of PPD, it may be prudent to investigate combined interventions rather than monotherapies. There is still a major need to develop a dietary supplement that creates resiliency against the biological changes in early postpartum associated with risk for mood disorders and/or PPD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dowlati Y ; Meyer JH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00737-020-01091-3 ","Keywords":"*Depression, Postpartum/prevention & control\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHormones\r\nHumans\r\nPostpartum Period\r\nRisk Factors\r\nDietary supplements\r\nNatural health products\r\nPostpartum depression\r\nPrevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dowlati Y, and Meyer JH (2021) Promising leads and pitfalls: a review of dietary supplements and hormone treatments to prevent postpartum blues and postpartum depression..

Oxidative stress has been linked to poor psychological outcomes including psychological distress, which has wide-reaching implications for the community and the workplace. Given work-related stress has been associated with poor mental health outcomes, high-dose B vitamin supplementation may be effective in improving brain function and psychological outcomes via attenuation of oxidative stress. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated psychological outcomes following 6-month supplementation of a high-B-vitamin multivitamin in a large sample of healthy adults (n = 108, aged 30-70 years), as well as changes in default mode network functional connectivity in a subset of the original sample (n = 28). Improvements in occupational stress, general health, perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and mood profiles were identified for both active and placebo groups over time (p < 0.05 corrected). Seed-based functional connectivity analysis centered on the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) showed that connectivity between the PCC and the caudate increased for the active treatment group, but decreased for the placebo group (p < 0.05 corrected). These findings reveal a substantial intervention effect for both active and placebo treatments, which could in part be associated with a placebo effect in subjective measures. There was, however, a significant treatment effect in the objective measure of functional connectivity, suggesting that reduced psychological stress and high-B-vitamin multivitamin supplementation may lead to an increase in DMN and caudate functional connectivity, which might reflect a strengthening of neurocircuitry within areas associated with reward and emotion at rest. Future studies should consider a placebo run-in methodology to reduce the placebo effect on the subjective measures of stress.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Downey LA ; Simpson TN ; Ford TC ; McPhee G ; Suo C ; Myers SP ; Oliver C ; Stough CKK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fnut.2019.00156 ","Keywords":"default mode network\r\nfunctional connectivity\r\nmultivitamin\r\nresting state\r\nstress\r\nvitamin B","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Downey LA, Simpson TN, Ford TC, McPhee G, Suo C, Myers SP, Oliver C, and Stough CKK (2019) Increased Posterior Cingulate Functional Connectivity Following 6-Month High-Dose B-Vitamin Multivitamin Supplementation: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial..

Furthermore, recent preclinical studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that in rodents, chronic stress and the stress hormone cortisol cause oxidative damage to mitochondrial function and membrane lipids in the brain. Mitochondria play a key role in synaptic neurotransmitter signaling by providing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), mediating lipid and protein synthesis, buffering intracellular calcium, and regulating apoptotic and resilience pathways. Membrane lipids are similarly essential to central nervous system (CNS) function because cholesterol, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and sphingolipids form a lipid raft region, a special lipid region on the membrane that mediates neurotransmitter signaling through G-protein-coupled receptors and ion channels. Low serum cholesterol levels, low antioxidant capacity, and abnormal early morning cortisol levels are biomarkers consistently associated with both depression and suicidal behaviors. In this review, we summarize the manner in which nutrients can protect against oxidative damage to mitochondria and lipids in the neuronal circuits associated with cognitive and affective behaviors. These nutrients include ω3 fatty acids, antioxidants (vitamin C and zinc), members of the vitamin B family (Vitamin B12 and folic acid), and magnesium. Accumulating data have shown that these nutrients can enhance neurocognitive function, and may have therapeutic benefits for depression and suicidal behaviors. A growing body of studies suggests the intriguing possibility that regular consumption of these nutrients may help prevent the onset of mood disorders and suicidal behaviors in vulnerable individuals, or significantly augment the therapeutic effect of available antidepressants. These findings have important implications for the health of both military and civilian populations.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Du J ; Zhu M ; Bao H ; Li B ; Dong Y ; Xiao C ; Zhang GY ; Henter I ; Rudorfer M ; Vitiello B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/10408398.2013.876960 ","Keywords":"Antioxidants/administration & dosage\r\nCholesterol/blood\r\nDepression/*diet therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nHydrocortisone/blood\r\nMagnesium/administration & dosage\r\nMilitary Personnel\r\nMitochondria/*physiology\r\nNeurotransmitter Agents/*metabolism\r\nOxidative Stress/drug effects\r\nSignal Transduction\r\nSleep Deprivation/complications\r\nStress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*diet therapy\r\nStress, Psychological/complications\r\nSuicide/*prevention & control\r\nVitamin B Complex/administration & dosage\r\nVitamin\r\nlipid\r\noxidative stress\r\nsuicide\r\nsynaptic plasticity\r\nzinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Du J, Zhu M, Bao H, Li B, Dong Y, Xiao C, Zhang GY, Henter I, Rudorfer M, and Vitiello B (2016) The Role of Nutrients in Protecting Mitochondrial Function and Neurotransmitter Signaling: Implications for the Treatment of Depression, PTSD, and Suicidal Behaviors..

Participants were interviewed to obtain data on socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle, current medications, medical and family history. The daily intake of thiamine was assessed by a 24-h recall. The mean age of the 34 700 study subjects was 42⋅9 years (sd 22⋅8, min-max: 1-80) and 19 342 (55⋅7 %) were women. The levels of thiamine intake were 1⋅126 mg (2016), 1⋅115 mg (2017) and 1⋅087 mg (2018) for women, which were equal to or only slightly above the recommended intake of 1⋅10 mg/d for women. The levels of thiamine intake from 2014-15 and 2016-18 significantly decreased. The estimated percentage of insufficient thiamine intake was 37⋅8 % (95 % CI 37⋅3, 38⋅4). Multivariable regression analysis adjusted for potential confounders showed that thiamine intake was critically associated with lower risks of hypertension, MI or angina, type 2 diabetes, depression and dyslipidemia. The daily thiamine intake from food can reversal the risks of hypertension (OR 0⋅95; 95 % CI 0⋅90, 0⋅99), MI or angina (OR 0⋅84; 95 % CI 0⋅74, 0⋅95), type 2 diabetes (OR 0⋅86; 95 % CI 0⋅81, 0⋅93), depression (OR 0⋅90; 95 % CI 0⋅83, 0⋅97) and dyslipidemia (OR 0⋅90; 95 % CI 0⋅86, 0⋅95), respectively. Further works are needed to identify the effects of thiamine and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and mental health. A preventive thiamine supplementation strategy should be adopted to target NCDs and mental health and risk factors associated with thiamine deficiency. The optimisation of NCD control and mental health protection is also a vital integral part of Korea's public health system.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Duc HN ; Oh H ; Yoon IM ; Kim MS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/jns.2021.23 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\n*Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology\r\nChild\r\nChild, Preschool\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/epidemiology\r\n*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology\r\n*Diet\r\nDyslipidemias/epidemiology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nHypertension/epidemiology\r\nInfant\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nRepublic of Korea/epidemiology\r\nThiamine/*administration & dosage\r\nYoung Adult\r\nKNHANES\r\nMental health\r\nNon-communicable diseases\r\nThiamine intake","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Duc HN, Oh H, Yoon IM, and Kim MS (2021) Association between levels of thiamine intake, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and depression in Korea: a national cross-sectional study..

Thirty two male Wistar rats (200-220g) were randomly divided into: control, VitC, CIS, and CIS + VitC groups. Animals received VitC (500 mg/kg/day)/saline by gavage for 3 weeks. For 24 h cumulative and post 18-20 h fasting food intake, fasting plasma ghrelin level, and body weight were measured. Gastric histopathology was also evaluated.Results. Results showed a marked increase in fasting plasma ghrelin and food intake in stressed rats compared to controls. VitC prevented the increases in stressed rats. Histological assessment indicated a positive effect of VitC on gastric glandular cells compared to control, an effect that might partially be a reason of significant increase of plasma ghrelin levels in VitC rats. Elevated plasma ghrelin in VitC group was even higher than that one in stressed group, whereas there were no significant changes in the food intake. Assessment of the percentage of changes in body weight during 21 days showed a significant increase in stressed rats compared to controls. Vitamin C treatment prevented this increase. Stressed rats also displayed depression-like behavior as indicated by sucrose test, whereas VitC ameliorated it.Conclusions.

DESIGN: We analyzed baseline and follow-up data of 2119 volunteers of a community program that promotes healthy lifestyles and encourages vitamin D supplementation. We examined the program effect on each of the five dimensions of the EQ-5D-5L, HRQOL score, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using multivariable regression methods. We further examined the specific contribution of vitamin D status as quantified by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). RESULTS: Problems with mobility, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and depression/anxiety were reported less during follow-up compared to baseline. On average, participants' HRQOL had improved by 0.018 units at 6 months and 0.025 units at 1 year of follow-up. Improvements in vitamin D status were independently associated with improvements in HRQOL and in QALYs. As per 25 nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D, there was a 0.002 increase in HRQOL and a 0.001 increase in QALYs. CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the benefits of a real-world preventive health program to HRQOL. It is the first to reveal that improvements in vitamin D status parallel improvements in HRQOL among healthy community dwellers. The study further suggests that the preventive health program and supplementation with vitamin D are cost-effective interventions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ekwaru JP ; Ohinmaa A ; Veugelers PJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11136-015-1103-7 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nCanada\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHealth Promotion/*methods\r\n*Health Status\r\nHumans\r\nLife Style\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Quality of Life\r\nQuality-Adjusted Life Years\r\nRegression Analysis\r\nResidence Characteristics\r\nVitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/blood/therapeutic use\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/drug therapy\r\nDisease prevention\r\nHealth-related quality of life\r\nIntervention\r\nNutrition\r\nPublic health\r\nVitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ekwaru JP, Ohinmaa A, and Veugelers PJ (2016) The effectiveness of a preventive health program and vitamin D status in improving health-related quality of life of older Canadians..

The brain is adversely affected by aging with increased risks of developing various neurological disorders. Thus, it is essential to investigate practical approaches that can counteract the impact of aging on the brain. Vitamin K2 (Vit. K2) is a naturally occurring vitamin with reported valuable therapeutic effects. The current study highlights the role of Vit. K2 administration in counteracting age-related changes in the brain using naturally aging rats. Three-month-old rats were assigned to two groups: an ageing control group receiving a drug vehicle and an ageing group orally gavaged with Vit. K2 (30 mg/kg, once daily 5 days per week). Treatment was continued for 17 months. Ten three-month-old rats were used as the adult control. Vit. K2 improved functional performance, reduced social anxiety, depressive-like behavior, and enhanced memory performance with concomitant preservation of hippocampal and cerebral cortex tyrosine hydroxylase expression. Biochemically, Vit. K2 administration restored oxidative-anti-oxidative homeostasis in the brain. Vit. K2 modulated inflammatory signaling, as evidenced by suppression in the brain of NLRP3, caspase-1, Il-1β, TNFα, IL-6, and CD68 expression. Concomitantly, histopathological examination revealed consistent hippocampal and cerebral cortex improvement. Thus, it can be inferred that Vit K2 can slow down age-related changes in the brain associated with modulation of NLRP3/caspase-1/Nrf-2 signaling.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Elkattawy HA ; Ghoneim FM ; Eladl MA ; Said E ; Ebrahim HA ; El-Shafey M ; Asseri SM ; El-Sherbiny M ; Alsalamah RH ; Elsherbiny NM ; Hadhod S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/antiox11030514 ","Keywords":"NLRP3\r\nVit.

Our present aim was to investigate the genomic background of these two aspects of perseverative negative thinking within separate groups of individuals with suboptimal versus optimal folate intake. We conducted a genome-wide association study in the UK Biobank database (n = 72,621) on the \"rumination\" and \"worry\" items of the Eysenck Personality Inventory Neuroticism scale in these separate groups. Optimal folate intake was related to lower worry, but unrelated to rumination. In contrast, genetic associations for worry did not implicate specific biological processes, while past-oriented rumination had a more specific genetic background, emphasizing its endophenotypic nature. Furthermore, biological pathways leading to rumination appeared to differ according to folate intake: purinergic signaling and circadian regulator gene ARNTL emerged in the whole sample, blastocyst development, DNA replication, and C-C chemokines in the suboptimal folate group, and prostaglandin response and K(+) channel subunit gene KCNH3 in the optimal folate group. Our results point to possible benefits of folate in anxiety disorders, and to the importance of simultaneously taking into account genetic and environmental factors to determine personalized intervention in polygenic and multifactorial disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Eszlari N ; Bruncsics B ; Millinghoffer A ; Hullam G ; Petschner P ; Gonda X ; Breen G ; Antal P ; Bagdy G ; Deakin JFW ; Juhasz G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu13124396 ","Keywords":"ARNTL Transcription Factors\r\nAdolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAnxiety/*diet therapy/etiology/genetics\r\nDepression/etiology\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nEating/*physiology\r\nEther-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/*administration & dosage\r\nGenome-Wide Association Study\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNerve Tissue Proteins\r\nNeuroticism\r\nNutritional Physiological Phenomena/*genetics\r\nPessimism/*psychology\r\nRumination, Cognitive\r\nYoung Adult\r\nGWAS\r\nfolate\r\ngene x diet interaction\r\nneuroticism\r\nrumination\r\nworry","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Eszlari N, Bruncsics B, Millinghoffer A, Hullam G, Petschner P, Gonda X, Breen G, Antal P, Bagdy G, Deakin JFW, and Juhasz G (2021) Biology of Perseverative Negative Thinking: The Role of Timing and Folate Intake..

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of folate supplementation on neurobehaviour oxidative stress and cerebral cortex histomorphology in the dexamethasone mouse model of depression. METHODS: Male mice were assigned to six groups (A-F) of 10 mice each. Animals in groups A and D were fed a standard diet, while those in B and E were fed folic acid supplemented diet (25 mg/kg of feed), while C and F were fed folate supplemented diet at 50 mg/kg of feed for 8 weeks. At the beginning of the sixth 6th week, mice in groups A-C were administered distilled water, while animals in groups D-F were administered dexamethasone (DEX) at 4 mg/kg body weight by gavage. Open-field, forced swim, and tail-suspension tests were conducted at the end of the experimental period, following which animals were euthanised and blood was taken for the estimation of Malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced Glutathione, Glutathione Peroxidase, Catalase activity, and Superoxide Dismutase. Sections of the cerebral cortex were prepared for histological examination. RESULTS: Folic acid supplementation increased body weight, locomotor, rearing and self-grooming behaviours, and decreased immobility time in the tail suspension and forced swim tests. There was also a reduction of lipid peroxidation and an increase in the antioxidant status. Folic acid supplementation was also found to be protective against the development of dexamethasone-induced changes in body weight, open-field behaviours, behavioural despair, oxidative stress and cerebrocortical morphology. CONCLUSION: Folic-acid supplementation improves the behavioral, some antioxidant, and cerebral morphological parameters.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Falade J ; Onaolapo AY ; Onaolapo OJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1871524921666210114125355 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Antioxidants/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/chemically induced/drug therapy\r\nDexamethasone/toxicity\r\nDiet\r\nDietary Supplements\r\n*Folic Acid\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nOxidative Stress\r\nDepression\r\nantioxidant\r\ncerebral morphology.\r\ndexamethasone\r\nfolic acid\r\nmice","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Falade J, Onaolapo AY, and Onaolapo OJ (2021) Evaluation of the Behavioural, Antioxidative and Histomorphological Effects of Folic Acid-supplemented Diet in Dexamethasone-induced Depression in Mice..

The aim of this study was to examine the association between antioxidant vitamin intakes and the risk of depression, anxiety, and stress. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 263 Tehranian female adolescents. Dietary intakes of vitamin E, C, and β-Carotene were determined using a valid and reliable food-frequency questionnaire. Depression, anxiety, and stress scores were characterized by DASS-21 (Depression Anxiety Stress Score-21 items) questionnaire. The multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) of depression, anxiety, and stress across tertiles of antioxidant vitamin intakes. RESULTS: The mean ± SD age of participants was 16.20 ± 0.97 years. Also, the mean ± SD depression, anxiety and stress scores of participants were 9.89 ± 4.15, 8.43 ± 4.39 and 14.00 ± 6.45, respectively. In the fully adjusted model, subjects in the highest tertile of β-Carotene had a lower prevalence of depression (OR:0.46, 95%CI:0.23-0.95), anxiety (OR:0.40, 95%CI:0.20-0.81), and stress (OR:0.35, 95%CI:0.17-0.73) compared to the lowest tertile (P for trend<0.05). Moreover, individuals in the top tertile of vitamin E had a lower prevalence of stress, in comparison to the bottom tertile (OR:0.34, 95% CI:0.13-0.89), (P for trend<0.05). However, no significant associations were found between the intakes of vitamin E and C and other psychological disorders. CONCLUSION: In this study, higher intake of β-Carotene was associated with lower prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress. Also, we found an inverse relationship between vitamin E intake and the risk of stress.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Farhadnejad H ; Neshatbini Tehrani A; Salehpour A ; Hekmatdoost A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.09.010 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\n*Antioxidants\r\nAnxiety/epidemiology\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\n*Depression/epidemiology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfant\r\nVitamins\r\nAdolescents\r\nAntioxidants\r\nAnxiety\r\nDepression\r\nStress\r\nVitamin","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Farhadnejad H, Neshatbini Tehrani A, Salehpour A, and Hekmatdoost A (2020) Antioxidant vitamin intakes and risk of depression, anxiety and stress among female adolescents..

Folate, a naturally occurring B vitamin, is needed in the brain for the synthesis of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. Three forms of folate are commonly used: folic acid, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) (also known as methylfolate and L-methylfolate), and folinic acid. Some forms may be more bioavailable than others in patients with a genetic polymorphism and in those who take particular medications or use alcohol. Folic acid augmentation in depressed patients may reduce residual symptoms. The 5-MTHF formulation indicated efficacy as adjunctive therapy or monotherapy in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with normal and low folate levels, improving cognitive function and reducing depressive symptoms in elderly patients with dementia and folate deficiency, and reducing depressive and somatic symptoms in patients with depression and alcoholism. Adjunctive folinic acid reduced depressive symptoms in patients who were partially responsive or nonresponsive to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Evidence for the efficacy of folate in improving cognitive symptoms is equivocal, but most studies used folic acid. Although the studies reviewed have limitations and, historically, concerns have been raised about the role of folate in increasing cancer risk, masking B(12) deficiency, and worsening depressive symptoms, folate is generally well tolerated, and 5-MTHF may be less likely to incur some of these risks. Several forms of folate appear to be safe and efficacious in some individuals with major depressive disorder, but more information is needed about dosage and populations most suited to folate therapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fava M ; Mischoulon D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.8157su1c.03 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nChemistry, Pharmaceutical\r\nClinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data\r\nDementia/drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDosage Forms\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nFolic Acid Deficiency/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLeucovorin/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nTetrahydrofolates/therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fava M, and Mischoulon D (2009) Folate in depression: efficacy, safety, differences in formulations, and clinical issues..

Cholecalciferol was administered to the ovariectomized (OVX) rats and OVX rats treated with 17β-estradiol (17β-E(2), 0.5μg/rat,s.c., once daily, for 14days). Depression-like behavior and spontaneous locomotor activity were assessed in the forced swimming test (FST) and the open field test (OFT), respectively. The corticosterone levels in the blood serum before and after FST were measured in all experimental groups. Treatment with cholecalciferol in high dose (5.0mg/kg/day,s.c.) significantly decreased the immobility time of OVX rats in the FST. Co-administration of cholecalciferol in high dose with 17β-E(2) exerted a markedly synergistic antidepressant-like effect in the OVX rats on the same model of depression-like behavior testing. Cholecalciferol in high dose (5.0mg/kg/day,s.c.) administered alone or together with 17β-E(2) significantly enhanced frequency of grooming for the OVX rats in the OFT. Moreover, cholecalciferol in high dose administered alone or together with 17β-E(2) significantly decreased the elevated corticosterone levels in the blood serum of OVX rats following the FST.

For years, the research and development of drugs to be used in MDD focused on the monoaminergic system, leading to the introduction in the market of tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Nonetheless, patients continue to experience low remission rates, frequent relapses and persistent functional impairment. These drawbacks emphasize the need to studying alternative therapeutic targets in order to improve depression treatment efficacy. Herein, ascorbate role in the pathophysiology of MDD is discussed, particularly through the modulation of the glutamatergic system. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data regarding its antidepressant effect in affective disorders is reviewed. The electronic database Pubmed was searched from 2005 to the present date, using the following keywords: \"ascorbate\", \"glutamate\", \"major depressive disorder\", \"depression\", \"ascorbic acid\", and \"vitamin C\". Overall, 31 studies were retrieved, evidencing ascorbate efficacy on reversing depressive symptoms associated with MDD through the modulation of glutamatergic signalling, namely through the l-Arginine-NO-cGMP pathway. The present review supports the high potential of ascorbate in the research of new treatment strategies for MDD and it is expected to be very useful for the development of new target-antidepressant drugs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ferreira NR ; Vitorino C ; Fortuna A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bcp.2022.115300 ","Keywords":"Ascorbate\r\nAscorbic acid\r\nGlutamate\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nTreatment resistant depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ferreira NR, Vitorino C, and Fortuna A (2022) From antioxidant to neuromodulator: The role of ascorbate in the management of major depression disorder..

This double-blind study investigated the effects of supplementation for 1 month with a high-dose of B6 or B12, compared to placebo, on a range of behavioural outcome measures connected to the balance between neural inhibition and excitation. METHODS: 478 young adults were recruited over five linked phases. Self-reported anxiety (N = 265) and depression (N = 146) were assessed at baseline and after supplementation. Several sensory measures acted as assays of inhibitory function and were assessed post-supplementation only; these were surround suppression of visual contrast detection (N = 307), binocular rivalry reversal rate (N = 172), and a battery of tactile sensitivity tests (N = 180). RESULTS: Vitamin B6 supplementation reduced self-reported anxiety and induced a trend towards reduced depression, as well as increased surround suppression of visual contrast detection, but did not reliably influence the other outcome measures. Vitamin B12 supplementation produced trends towards changes in anxiety and visual processing. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that high-dose Vitamin B6 supplementation increases inhibitory GABAergic neural influences, which is consistent with its known role in the synthesis of GABA.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Field DT ; Cracknell RO ; Eastwood JR ; Scarfe P ; Williams CM ; Zheng Y ; Tavassoli T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/hup.2852 ","Keywords":"Young Adult\r\nHumans\r\n*Vitamin B 6/therapeutic use\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nVitamin B 12/therapeutic use\r\nCognition\r\nAnxiety/drug therapy/prevention & control\r\nFolic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nGABA\r\nVitamin B12\r\nVitamin B6\r\nanxiety\r\ndepression\r\nsurround suppression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Field DT, Cracknell RO, Eastwood JR, Scarfe P, Williams CM, Zheng Y, and Tavassoli T (2022) High-dose Vitamin B6 supplementation reduces anxiety and strengthens visual surround suppression..

Hematologic indices are normal in up to 30% of patients with vitamin B12 deficiency, and results of the Schilling test may be normal in patients with symptoms of deficiency. Isolated neuropathy or myelopathy may occur independently, but often appear concurrently. The neuropathy is primarily axonal and predominantly sensory. Myelopathy is caused by demyelinated areas in posterior and lateral columns. After therapy, recovery from neuropathy is incomplete or may extend for several years. Vitamin B12 replacement should not be withheld from patients with borderline vitamin B12 levels, since the consequences of allowing myelopathy, neuropathy, dementia, and mental disorders to worsen clearly outweigh any disadvantage of therapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fine EJ ; Soria ED ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00007611-199112000-00016 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nDementia/drug therapy/etiology\r\nDepression/drug therapy/etiology\r\nElectromyography\r\nEvoked Potentials, Somatosensory\r\nHumans\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nVitamin B 12/*blood/therapeutic use\r\nVitamin B 12 Deficiency/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fine EJ, and Soria ED (1991) Myths about vitamin B12 deficiency..

Over 40 papers and book chapters published in English, French, German, Italian and Spanish were examined. This represents those papers published in the international literature in the last 10 years which were identified by various key words including folate, cognition and aging (or ageing). Among these papers, only 13 articles specifically addressed issues relevant to the criteria adopted for this review. The remaining papers were principally concerned with depression and or with other pathologies of the aged associated with folate deficiency. Although the specific role of low folate levels in the physiopathology of dementia is still under debate, a growing consensus is emerging in the literature where low folate as well as cobalamin levels in aged patients with cognitive deficits are being considered as a sign of functional problems in the absorption and utilization of vitamins, and not merely as a sign of bad eating habits. In studies where folate compounds were evaluated for treatment effects, the results of a majority of investigations indicated that folate treatment was effective in lessening cognitive deficits. Treatment efficacy, however, has not yet been sufficiently demonstrated by these results because there were no controlled studies and the methodology was heterogeneous for the evaluation of cognitive characteristics. An ad hoc double-blind, controlled versus placebo pilot study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of folic acid in 30 aged patients with abnormal cognitive decline and folate level below 3 ng/ml to better understand the value of this type of intervention. Our results from this preliminary study demonstrated that patients treated with folic acid for 60 days showed a significant improvement on both memory and attention efficiency when compared with a placebo group. The intensity of memory improvement was positively correlated with initial severity of folate deficiency. On the contrary, the severity of initial cognitive decline was unrelated to the degree of folate deficiency.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fioravanti M ; Ferrario E ; Massaia M ; Cappa G ; Rivolta G ; Grossi E ; Buckley AE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0167-4943(97)00028-9 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fioravanti M, Ferrario E, Massaia M, Cappa G, Rivolta G, Grossi E, and Buckley AE (1998) Low folate levels in the cognitive decline of elderly patients and the efficacy of folate as a treatment for improving memory deficits..

Along with dietary intake, nutrition can also be obtained from \"nutrient supplements\", such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, amino acids and pre/probiotic supplements. Recently, a large number of meta-analyses have emerged examining nutrient supplements in the treatment of mental disorders. To produce a meta-review of this top-tier evidence, we identified, synthesized and appraised all meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy and safety of nutrient supplements in common and severe mental disorders. Our systematic search identified 33 meta-analyses of placebo-controlled RCTs, with primary analyses including outcome data from 10,951 individuals. The strongest evidence was found for PUFAs (particularly as eicosapentaenoic acid) as an adjunctive treatment for depression. More nascent evidence suggested that PUFAs may also be beneficial for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, whereas there was no evidence for schizophrenia. Folate-based supplements were widely researched as adjunctive treatments for depression and schizophrenia, with positive effects from RCTs of high-dose methylfolate in major depressive disorder. There was emergent evidence for N-acetylcysteine as a useful adjunctive treatment in mood disorders and schizophrenia. All nutrient supplements had good safety profiles, with no evidence of serious adverse effects or contraindications with psychiatric medications. In conclusion, clinicians should be informed of the nutrient supplements with established efficacy for certain conditions (such as eicosapentaenoic acid in depression), but also made aware of those currently lacking evidentiary support. Future research should aim to determine which individuals may benefit most from evidence-based supplements, to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Firth J ; Teasdale SB ; Allott K ; Siskind D ; Marx W ; Cotter J ; Veronese N ; Schuch F ; Smith L ; Solmi M ; Carvalho AF ; Vancampfort D ; Berk M ; Stubbs B ; Sarris J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/wps.20672 ","Keywords":"N-acetylcysteine\r\nNutrient supplements\r\nadjunctive treatment\r\nattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\r\ndepression\r\neicosapentaenoic acid\r\nmethylfolate\r\nomega-3\r\npolyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nschizophrenia\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Firth J, Teasdale SB, Allott K, Siskind D, Marx W, Cotter J, Veronese N, Schuch F, Smith L, Solmi M, Carvalho AF, Vancampfort D, Berk M, Stubbs B, and Sarris J (2019) The efficacy and safety of nutrient supplements in the treatment of mental disorders: a meta-review of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials..

Overall, results from 25 cross-sectional studies as well as from 8 longitudinal studies suggest a role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of mental disorders in childhood and adolescence. Findings from supplementation trials seem to support this hypothesis. However, randomized controlled trials in adults revealed conflicting results. Randomized controlled trials in childhood and adolescents are urgently needed to support the potential of vitamin D as a complementary therapeutic option in mental disorders. Study designs should consider methodological challenges, e.g., hypovitaminosis D at baseline, appropriate supplementation doses, sufficient intervention periods, an adequate power, clinically validated diagnostic instruments, and homogenous, well-defined risk groups.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Föcker M ; Antel J ; Ring S ; Hahn D ; Kanal Ö ; Öztürk D ; Hebebrand J ; Libuda L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00787-017-0949-3 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nChild\r\nChild, Preschool\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfant\r\nMale\r\n*Mental Health\r\nVitamin D/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/*complications\r\n25(OH)D\r\nADHD\r\nAutism\r\nDepression\r\nMental health\r\nVitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Föcker M, Antel J, Ring S, Hahn D, Kanal Ö, Öztürk D, Hebebrand J, and Libuda L (2017) Vitamin D and mental health in children and adolescents..

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present letter was to highlight recent findings in the field to guide nutritional interventions in psychiatry. METHOD: An overview of the most recent meta-analyses in the field of psychonutrition in severe mental disorders has been carried out. RESULTS: The Mediterranean diet showed the best evidence for effectiveness in diminishing the incidence of depressive symptomatology Complementary agents were found to be associated with lower depression levels (even in psychiatric populations): omegas 3 fatty acids, vitamin D, methylfolate and S-adenosylmethionine, all being found in high rates in the Mediterranean diet. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) has also been found to be associated with lower depression. Moreover, major depression has been associated with inflammatory disturbances and a diet with a low Dietary Inflammatory Index has also been shown to be associated with lower depression. These effects may be mediated by microbiota modifications and probiotic supplementation has been recently shown to be effective in the treatment of depression. A high protein diet may also be particularly useful in psychiatry. The high protein diet has shown effectiveness in weight loss and increasing satiety with no evidence for deleterious effects in subjects without chronic conditions like renal failure, diabetes or cardiovascular disease. A reduction of 20% of calorific intake +/- intermittent fasting (i.e. fasting for 12 to 16 h per day) may also improve microbiota and therefore psychiatric conditions. CONCLUSION: In light of these findings, diet modifications appear to be an underutilized tool with which to improve the mental and physical health of psychiatric patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fond G ; Young AH ; Godin O ; Messiaen M ; Lançon C ; Auquier P ; Boyer L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2019.11.092 ","Keywords":"Diet\r\nDiet, Healthy\r\n*Diet, Mediterranean\r\nFasting\r\nHumans\r\n*Mental Disorders/therapy\r\nMental Health","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fond G, Young AH, Godin O, Messiaen M, Lançon C, Auquier P, and Boyer L (2020) Improving diet for psychiatric patients : High potential benefits and evidence for safety..

The establishment of ketamine-like drugs is still a challenge and ascorbic acid has emerged as a candidate. This study investigated the ascorbic acid's ability to induce a fast antidepressant-like response and to improve hippocampal synaptic markers in mice subjected to chronic corticosterone (CORT) administration. CORT was administered for 21 days, followed by a single administration of ascorbic acid (1 mg ∕Kg, p.o.), ketamine (1 mg ∕Kg, i.p.) or fluoxetine (10 mg ∕Kg, p.o.) in mice. Depressive-like behavior, hippocampal synaptic proteins immunocontent, dendrite spines density in the dentate gyrus (DG) were analyzed 24 h following treatments. The administration of ascorbic acid or ketamine, but not fluoxetine, counteracted CORT-induced depressive-like behavior in the tail suspension test (TST). CORT administration reduced PSD-95, GluA1, and synapsin (synaptic markers) immunocontent, and these alterations were reversed by ascorbic acid or ketamine, but only ketamine reversed the CORT-induced reduction on GluA1 immunocontent. In the ventral and dorsal DG, CORT decreased filopodia-, thin- and stubby-shaped spines, while ascorbic acid and ketamine abolished this alteration only in filopodia spines. Ascorbic acid and ketamine increased mushroom-shaped spines density in ventral and dorsal DG. Therefore, the results show that a single administration of ascorbic acid, in a way similar to ketamine, rapidly elicits an antidepressant-like response and reverses hippocampal synaptic deficits caused by CORT, an effect associated with increased levels of synaptic proteins and dendritic remodeling.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fraga DB ; Camargo A ; Olescowicz G ; Azevedo Padilha D; Mina F ; Budni J ; Brocardo PS ; Rodrigues ALS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.cbi.2021.109476 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAscorbic Acid/*therapeutic use\r\nCorticosterone\r\nDendritic Spines/drug effects\r\nDepression/chemically induced/*drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHindlimb Suspension\r\nHippocampus/*drug effects\r\nKetamine/therapeutic use\r\nMice\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAscorbic acid\r\nCorticosterone\r\nDendrite spine\r\nDepression\r\nKetamine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fraga DB, Camargo A, Olescowicz G, Azevedo Padilha D, Mina F, Budni J, Brocardo PS, and Rodrigues ALS (2021) A single administration of ascorbic acid rapidly reverses depressive-like behavior and hippocampal synaptic dysfunction induced by corticosterone in mice..

Previous studies suggested a dysregulation of GMPBB and mannose in depression. Evidence, however, was sporadic and interventions to reverse these changes are unknown. Here, we show that GMPPB protein, but not RNA abundance is increased in the postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) of depressed patients and the chronic variable stress (CVS) mouse-model. This is accompanied by higher plasma mannose levels. Importantly, a single dose of intraperitoneally administered vitamin B12, which has previously been shown to rapidly reverse behavioral symptoms and molecular signatures of chronic stress in mice, normalized GMPPB plasma mannose levels and elevated GDP-mannose abundance. In summary, these data underline metabolic dysregulation in chronic stress and depression and provide further support for rapid effects of vitamin B12 on chronic stress.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Franzka P ; Turecki G ; Cubillos S ; Kentache T ; Steiner J ; Walter M ; Hübner CA ; Engmann O ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fnut.2022.981511 ","Keywords":"depression\r\nglycosylation\r\nmannose\r\nstress\r\nvitamin B12","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Franzka P, Turecki G, Cubillos S, Kentache T, Steiner J, Walter M, Hübner CA, and Engmann O (2022) Altered mannose metabolism in chronic stress and depression is rapidly reversed by vitamin B12..

In this preliminary study, EnBrace HR, a prenatal supplement containing methylfolate, was investigated for depressive relapse prevention and for acute treatment of MDD in women planning pregnancy or during pregnancy. METHODS: This 12-week open-label study included women with histories of MDD who were planning pregnancy or pregnant < 28 weeks. At enrollment, Group 1 participants were well (not depressed) and planned to discontinue antidepressants for pregnancy. Group 2 participants were depressed. Primary outcome variables by group included MDD relapse and depressive symptoms, verified with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview and the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), respectively. Biomarkers of inflammation and the folate cycle were collected. RESULTS: Group 1 participants (N = 11) experienced lower rates of depressive relapse (27.3% P = .005) than expected from a historical comparison group and no significant changes in MADRS scores. Group 2 participants (N = 6) experienced significant improvements in MADRS scores (P = .001), with 5 (83.3%) improving >50% and 1 improving 33.3%. One adverse event occurred, a hospitalization for depression. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest EnBrace HR is a well-tolerated intervention with potential efficacy for prevention and treatment of perinatal depression.

AIM: In the present study we examined the effects of vitamin K2 on the behavior of rats with metabolic syndrome and looked for relationships with the effects on blood sugar. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats were divided in four groups: a control group on a regular rat chow, a metabolic syndrome (MS) group fed a high-fat high-fructose diet, a control group treated with vitamin K2 and a MS group treated with vitamin K2. Vitamin K2 was given by gavage. At the end of the study (after 10 weeks) behavioral tests were performed and fasting blood glucose was measured. Anxiety was determined using the social interaction test and depression was assessed by the Porsolt test. Memory effects were estimated by the object recognition test. Correlations between fasting blood glucose and behavioral performance were analyzed. RESULTS: The rats from the MS group had elevated blood glucose. They had anxiety, depression and memory deficit. Vitamin K2 normalized blood glucose, reduced anxiety and depression, but did not improve memory. Time of social interaction (inverse index of anxiety) and memory recognition were negatively correlated with blood glucose in the untreated rats but the immobility time (measure of depression) was not. When vitamin K2-treated rats were added, the correlation of blood glucose with the time of social interaction was kept, but the one with the recognition memory was lost. It might be that the anxiolytic effect of vitamin K2 in this setting is at least partly due to its effects on blood glucose, while the anti-depressant effect is glucose-independent. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that vitamin K2 prevented the development of anxiety and depression, but did not improve the memory deficit caused by the dietary manipulation in an experimental model of metabolic syndrome. It might be that the anxiolytic effect of vitamin K2 is at least partly due to its effects on blood glucose, while the antidepressant effect is glucose-independent.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gancheva SM ; Zhelyazkova-Savova MD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1515/folmed-2016-0032 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnxiety/metabolism/*psychology\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nBlood Glucose/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nCognition/*drug effects\r\nCognitive Dysfunction/metabolism/*psychology\r\nDepression/metabolism/*psychology\r\nDiet, High-Fat\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFructose\r\nMale\r\nMemory Disorders/metabolism/psychology\r\nMemory, Short-Term\r\nMetabolic Syndrome/metabolism/*psychology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nVitamin K 2/*pharmacology\r\nVitamins/*pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gancheva SM, and Zhelyazkova-Savova MD (2016) Vitamin K2 Improves Anxiety and Depression but not Cognition in Rats with Metabolic Syndrome: a Role of Blood Glucose?.

The present study aims to explore the beneficial effects of folic acid on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression-like behaviors and its possible mechanisms. The behavioral tests including open-field test, tail suspension test, and forced swimming test were used to evaluate the antidepressant effects of folic acid. Then the changes of brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentration, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) expression levels, and synaptic organization were assessed to explore the antidepressant mechanisms of folic acid. Our results showed that CUMS caused significant depression-like behaviors, neuropathological changes, and decreased brain 5-HT concentration, BDNF, and GluR1 expression in the hippocampus and association cortex. In conclusion, the results showed that folic acid significantly improved depression-like behaviors in CUMS-induced rats, and its antidepressant effects might be related to the increase of brain 5-HT concentration, BDNF and GluR1 expression, and repair of synaptic organization in the brain.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gao L ; Liu X ; Yu L ; Wu J ; Xu M ; Liu Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/WNR.0000000000000887 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\n*Behavior, Animal/drug effects/physiology\r\n*Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/drug effects/metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFolic Acid/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\n*Hippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\n*Receptors, AMPA/drug effects/metabolism\r\n*Sensorimotor Cortex/drug effects/metabolism\r\nSerotonin/*metabolism\r\n*Stress, Psychological/complications/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nUp-Regulation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gao L, Liu X, Yu L, Wu J, Xu M, and Liu Y (2017) Folic acid exerts antidepressant effects by upregulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glutamate receptor 1 expression in brain..

The aims of this trial were therefore to test the effect of nutritional support on older patient's depressive symptoms and cognitive function. METHODS: In this prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly assigned 225 hospitalised acutely ill older patients to receive either normal hospital diet plus 400 mL oral nutritional supplements (106 subjects) or normal hospital diet plus a placebo (119 subjects) daily for 6 weeks. The composition of the supplement was such as to provide 995 kcal for energy and 100% of the Reference Nutrient Intakes for a healthy old person for vitamins and minerals. Outcome measures were 6 weeks and 6 months changes in nutritional status, depressive symptoms and cognitive state. RESULTS: Randomisation to the supplement group led to a significant increase in red-cell folate and plasma vitamin B12 concentrations, in contrast to a decrease seen in the placebo group. There were significant differences in symptoms of depression scores in the supplement group compared with the placebo group at 6 months (p = 0.021 for between groups difference). The effect of supplement was seen in all patient groups including those with no symptoms of depression, mild depression and those with severe depression (p = 0.007). There was no evidence of a difference in cognitive function scores at 6 months. CONCLUSION: Oral nutritional supplementation of hospitalised acutely ill older patients led to a statistically significant benefit on depressive symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gariballa S ; Forster S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.clnu.2007.06.007 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAging/physiology\r\nCognition/*drug effects\r\nDepression/*therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nEnergy Intake/physiology\r\nErythrocytes/chemistry\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/blood\r\n*Food, Formulated\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMinerals/administration & dosage\r\nNutrition Policy\r\n*Nutritional Status\r\nNutritive Value\r\nPlacebos\r\nProspective Studies\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin B 12/blood\r\nVitamins/administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gariballa S, and Forster S (2007) Effects of dietary supplements on depressive symptoms in older patients: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial..

In this regard, thiamine (vitamin B(1)) is attracting growing interest. Thiamine is an essential nutrient, while thiamine deficiency leads to a broad variety of disorders including irritability and symptoms of depression. Here, we tested the hypothesis that adjuvant thiamine would reduce depression, compared to placebo. A total of 51 inpatients (mean age: 35.2 years; 53 % females) with MDD (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score (HDRS) at baseline: >24) took part in the study. A standardized treatment with SSRI was introduced and kept at therapeutic levels throughout the study. Patients were randomly assigned either to the thiamine or the placebo condition. Experts rated (HDRS) symptoms of depression at baseline, and after 3, 6, and 12 weeks (end of the study). Between baseline and the end of the study, depression had reduced in both groups. Compared to placebo, adjuvant thiamine improved symptoms of depression after 6 week of treatment, and improvements remained fairly stable until the end of the study, though mean differences at week 12 were not statistically significant anymore. No adverse side effects were reported in either group. Results suggest that among younger patients with MDD adjuvant thiamine alleviated symptoms of depression faster compared to placebo.

The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to assess the influence of vitamin D supplementation on mental health in MS patients. The systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020155779) and it was conducted on the basis of the PRISMA guidelines. The search procedure was conducted using PubMed and Web of Science databases and it included studies published up until September 2021. Six studies were included in the systematic review. The risk of bias was analyzed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Within the included studies, there were two studies randomized against placebo and four other prospective studies. The studies presented vitamin D interventions randomized against placebo or not randomized, while supplementation was applied for various durations-from 4 weeks to 12 months, or the studies compared patients who applied vitamin D supplementation and those who did not apply it and verified the effect of the supplementation after a number of years. The mental health outcomes that were assessed included quality of life, depression/depressive symptoms, and fatigue as an additional element. The majority of studies supported the positive influence of vitamin D on the mental health of MS patients, including the study characterized as having the highest quality (randomized against placebo with the highest NOS score). All the studies that assessed the quality of life indicated the positive influence of vitamin D while the studies that did not find a positive influence of vitamin D were conducted for depression/depressive symptoms. In spite of the fact that only a small number of studies have been conducted so far, and only two studies were randomized against a placebo, some conclusions may be formulated. The systematic review allowed us to conclude that there may be a positive effect of vitamin D supplementation in MS patients, which was stated in all of the studies analyzing quality of life, as well as in one study analyzing depressive symptoms. Considering that vitamin D deficiency is common in MS patients, and the potential positive influence of supplementation on the quality of life, supplementation should be applied at least in doses that cover the recommended intake.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Głąbska D ; Kołota A ; Lachowicz K ; Skolmowska D ; Stachoń M ; Guzek D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu13124207 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDepression/etiology/therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFatigue/etiology/therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMental Health\r\nMultiple Sclerosis/complications/*psychology\r\nQuality of Life/*psychology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin D/*therapeutic use\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/etiology/*therapy\r\ndepression\r\ndepressive symptoms\r\nfatigue\r\nmental health\r\nmultiple sclerosis\r\nquality of life\r\nsupplement\r\nsupplementation\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Głąbska D, Kołota A, Lachowicz K, Skolmowska D, Stachoń M, and Guzek D (2021) Vitamin D Supplementation and Mental Health in Multiple Sclerosis Patients: A Systematic Review..

The aim of the study was to analyze the association between vitamin D intake or status and mental health in children within a systematic review of literature, including both intervention and observational studies. The literature search was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and it covered peer-reviewed studies included in databases of PubMed and Web of Science until October 2019. The studies presenting either vitamin D intake, or vitamin D status in human subjects were allowed (excluding subjects with intellectual disabilities, eating disorders and neurological disorders), while for mental health the various methods of assessment and wide scope of factors were included. The bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The review was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020155779). A number of 7613 studies after duplicate removing were extracted by two independent researchers, followed by screening and assessment for eligibility, conducted by two independent researchers in two steps (based on title and abstract). Afterwards, the full texts were obtained and after reviewing, a number of 24 studies were included. The synthetic description of the results was prepared, structured around exposure (vitamin D supplementation/status) and outcome (components of mental health). The included studies were conducted either in groups of healthy individuals, or individuals with mental health problems, and they assessed following issues: behavior problems, violence behaviors, anxiety, depressive symptoms/depression, aggressive disorder, psychotic features, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, suicidal incident, as well as general patterns, as follows: mental health, level of distress, quality of life, well-being, mood, sleep patterns. The vast majority of assessed studies, including the most prominent ones (based on the NOS score) supported potential positive influence of vitamin D on mental health in children. As a limitation of the analysis, it should be indicated that studies conducted so far presented various studied groups, outcomes and psychological measures, so more studies are necessary to facilitate comparisons and deepen the observations. Nevertheless, vitamin D intake within a properly balanced diet or as a supplementation, except for a safe sun exposure, should be indicated as an element supporting mental health in children, so it should be recommended to meet the required 25(OH)cholecalciferol blood level in order to prevent or alleviate mental health problems.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Głąbska D ; Kołota A ; Lachowicz K ; Skolmowska D ; Stachoń M ; Guzek D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu13030952 ","Keywords":"Child\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/etiology\r\n*Mental Health\r\nVitamin D/metabolism/*physiology/therapeutic use\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/complications\r\ndepression\r\nintake\r\nmental disorders\r\nmental health\r\nstatus\r\nsupplementation\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Głąbska D, Kołota A, Lachowicz K, Skolmowska D, Stachoń M, and Guzek D (2021) The Influence of Vitamin D Intake and Status on Mental Health in Children: A Systematic Review..

Among various approaches to supportive therapy that aims to improve mental health in affected individuals, vitamin D supplementation is considered to be an effective method which may also be beneficial in alleviating the symptoms during the course of IBDs and IBS. The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature presenting the data regarding the influence of vitamin D supplementation on mental health in adults with inflammatory and functional bowel diseases, including IBDs and IBS. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (Registration number CRD42020155779). A systematic search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases was performed, and the intervention studies published until September 2021 were included. The human studies eligible to be included in the review should have described any intervention involving vitamin D as a supplement in a group of adult patients suffering from IBDs and/or IBS and should have assessed any component of mental health, but studies presenting the effects of combined supplementation of multiple nutrients were excluded. After eliminating the duplicates, a total of 8514 records were screened and assessed independently by two researchers. Further evaluation was carried out on the basis of title, abstract, and full text. Finally, 10 studies (four for IBDs and six for IBS) were selected for the current systematic review, and their quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The studies analyzed the influence of various doses of vitamin D on bowel diseases, compared the results of vitamin D supplementation with placebo, or administered specific doses of vitamin D to obtain the required level in the blood. Supplementation was performed for at least 6 weeks. The analyzed mental health outcomes mainly included disease-specific quality of life/quality of life, anxiety, and depression. The majority of studies (including high-quality ones) confirmed the positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on the mental health of IBD and IBS patients, which was proven by all research works evaluating anxiety and depression and by the majority of research works evaluating quality of life. Although the studies followed different dosage regimens and supplementation protocols, the positive influence of vitamin D on mental health was found to be consistent. The number of studies on patients suffering from ulcerative colitis and the availability of trials randomized against the placebo group was low in the current review, which is considered to be a limitation of the present study and could also reflect the final outcome of the analysis. The conducted systematic review established the positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on the mental health of IBD and IBS patients, but this result requires further investigation, particularly in relation to other mental health outcomes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Głąbska D ; Kołota A ; Lachowicz K ; Skolmowska D ; Stachoń M ; Guzek D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu13103662 ","Keywords":"*Dietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\nInflammatory Bowel Diseases/*drug therapy\r\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome/*drug therapy\r\n*Mental Health\r\nVitamin D/*therapeutic use\r\nanxiety\r\ndepression\r\ndisease-specific quality of life\r\ninflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)\r\nirritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\r\nmental health\r\nquality of life\r\nsupplement\r\nsupplementation\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Głąbska D, Kołota A, Lachowicz K, Skolmowska D, Stachoń M, and Guzek D (2021) Vitamin D Supplementation and Mental Health in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and Irritable Bowel Syndrome Patients: A Systematic Review..

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency might play a role in SAD. A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a group of 15 subjects with SAD. Eight subjects received 100,000 I.U. of vitamin D and seven subjects received phototherapy. At the onset of treatment and after 1 month of therapy subjects were administered the Hamilton Depression scale, the SIGH-SAD, and the SAD-8 depression scale. All subjects also had serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D) measured before and 1 week after intervention therapy. All subjects receiving vitamin D improved in all outcome measures. The phototherapy group showed no significant change in depression scale measures. Vitamin D status improved in both groups (74% vitamin D group, p < 0.005 and 36% phototherapy group, p < 0.01). Improvement in 25-OH D was significantly associated with improvement in depression scale scores (r2=0.26; p=0.05). Vitamin D may be an important treatment for SAD.

We investigated whether different intake levels of folate, vitamin B6 and B12 were associated with a 3-year depression incidence among generally healthy, community-dwelling older men and women. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Participants in the Québec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Aging (NuAge), free of depression (that is, 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) <11) at baseline (N=1368; 74 ± 4 years old; 50.5% women), were screened annually for incident depression (GDS ⩾ 11) or antidepressant medication. Tertiles of intakes (food only and food+supplements) were obtained from the mean of three non-consecutive 24-h recalls at baseline. Sex-stratified multiple logistic regression models were adjusted for age, physical activity, physical functioning, stressful life events and total energy intake. RESULTS: Over 3 years, 170 participants were identified as depressed. Women in the highest tertile of B6 intake from food were 43% less likely to become depressed when adjusting for demographic and health factors (multivariate odds ratio (OR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39-0.96), but adjustment for energy intake attenuated the effect. Men in the highest tertile of dietary B12 intake had decreased risk of depression (energy-adjusted multivariate OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20-0.90). No other association was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides some evidence of decreased depression risk among women with higher intakes of vitamin B6 from food, which was dependent on total energy intake, and among men with higher intakes of B12 from food, independently of energy intake.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gougeon L ; Payette H ; Morais JA ; Gaudreau P ; Shatenstein B ; Gray-Donald K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/ejcn.2015.202 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nDepression/*epidemiology\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nEnergy Intake\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/*administration & dosage\r\nHomes for the Aged\r\nHumans\r\nIncidence\r\nLogistic Models\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nMale\r\nNutrition Assessment\r\nQuality of Life\r\nQuebec\r\nRisk Factors\r\nVitamin B 12/*administration & dosage\r\nVitamin B 6/*administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gougeon L, Payette H, Morais JA, Gaudreau P, Shatenstein B, and Gray-Donald K (2016) Intakes of folate, vitamin B6 and B12 and risk of depression in community-dwelling older adults: the Quebec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Aging..

DESIGN: Ancillary study of a 1-year double-blind randomized clinical trial conducted in Zurich, Switzerland. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 200 community-dwelling adults 70 years and older with a prior fall event in the last year. Participants were randomized to receive 24 000 IU vitamin D(3) (considered standard of care), 60 000 IU vitamin D(3) , or 24 000 IU vitamin D(3) plus 300 μg calcifediol per month. MEASURES: The primary end point was the Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the SF-36. Secondary end points were the SF-36 Mental Health (MH) subscale and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 78 years (67% women), and 58% were vitamin D deficient (<20 ng/mL). Over time, primary and secondary end points did not differ significantly among the three treatment groups or in subgroups by vitamin D status at baseline. Given the lack of a true placebo group, we explored in a predefined observational analysis the change in mental health scales by achieved 25(OH)D levels at 12 months. After adjusting for confounders, participants achieving the highest 25(OH)D quartile (Q) at 12 months (44.7-98.9 ng/mL) had the greatest improvements in MCS (Q4 = 0.79 vs Q1 = -2.9; p = .03) and MH scales (Q4 = 2.54 vs Q1 = -3.07; p = .03); these associations were strongest among participants who were vitamin D deficient at baseline. No association was found for GDS (p = .89). CONCLUSIONS: For mental health, our study suggests no benefit of higher monthly doses of vitamin D(3) compared with the standard monthly dose of 24 000 IU. However, irrespective of vitamin D treatment dose, achieving higher 25(OH)D levels at 12-month follow-up was associated with a small, clinically uncertain but statistically significant improvement in mental health scores.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gugger A ; Marzel A ; Orav EJ ; Willett WC ; Dawson-Hughes B ; Theiler R ; Freystätter G ; Egli A ; Bischoff-Ferrari HA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/jgs.15808 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nCalcifediol/*administration & dosage\r\nCholecalciferol/*administration & dosage\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIndependent Living\r\nMale\r\n*Mental Health\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nSwitzerland\r\nSF-36\r\nclinical trial\r\nmental health scores\r\nolder adults\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gugger A, Marzel A, Orav EJ, Willett WC, Dawson-Hughes B, Theiler R, Freystätter G, Egli A, and Bischoff-Ferrari HA (2019) Effect of Monthly High-Dose Vitamin D on Mental Health in Older Adults: Secondary Analysis of a RCT..

The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature presenting the data regarding the influence of vitamin D supplementation on mental health in diabetic adults. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (Registration number CRD42020155779). A systematic search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases was performed, and the intervention studies published until September 2021 were included in the review. The human studies were included if an adult sample of diabetic individuals received vitamin D supplementation during the intervention and its effect on any mental health aspect was assessed, but studies presenting the influence of combined supplementation of multiple nutrients were excluded. After removing duplicate records, a total of 8514 publications were screened and assessed independently by two researchers, based on their title, abstract, and full text. Finally, six studies were included in the current systematic review, and the risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The included studies analyzed the influence of a specific dose of vitamin D, or different doses of vitamin D, or compared the results of supplementation with a specific dose of vitamin D against the placebo group. The supplementation was performed for at least 12 weeks. The mental health outcomes analyzed in these studies included health-related quality of life, depression, anxiety, stress, and general mental health status of adult diabetic patients. The results of the majority of the studies confirmed the positive influence of vitamin D supplementation on the mental health of diabetic individuals. Those studies that analyzed the influence of vitamin D supplementation on depression and anxiety established the beneficial effect of the vitamin. In some studies, the influence of vitamin D supplementation on the health-related quality of life was not considered unless combined with mindfulness training. However, it must be emphasized that different dosage regimens and intervention periods were followed in the reviewed studies, and only a small number of studies were randomized against placebo, which should be considered as a limitation of the present study. The findings of the conducted systematic review demonstrated the positive influence of vitamin D supplementation on the mental health of diabetic patients, which was proved for anxiety and depression, but in the case of health-related quality of life, the positive effect was observed only when the intervention included mindfulness training. These outcomes suggest that supplementation should be recommended to improve the vitamin D status and the mental health of patients in this group.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Guzek D ; Kołota A ; Lachowicz K ; Skolmowska D ; Stachoń M ; Głąbska D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu13113678 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAnxiety/blood/etiology/therapy\r\nDepression/blood/etiology/therapy\r\nDiabetes Mellitus/blood/*psychology\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMental Health\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNutrition Therapy/*methods\r\nQuality of Life\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin D/*administration & dosage\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/*psychology/therapy\r\nanxiety\r\ncholecalciferol\r\ndepression\r\ndiabetes\r\nhealth-related quality of life (HRQOL)\r\nmental health\r\nstress\r\nsupplementation\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Guzek D, Kołota A, Lachowicz K, Skolmowska D, Stachoń M, and Głąbska D (2021) Influence of Vitamin D Supplementation on Mental Health in Diabetic Patients: A Systematic Review..

Vitamin C, especially its reduced form, has gained interest for its multiple functions in various tissues and organs, including central nervous system (CNS). Vitamin C protects the neuron against oxidative stress, alleviates inflammation, regulates the neurotransmission, affects neuronal development and controls epigenetic function. All of these processes are closely associated with psychopathology. In the past few decades, scientists have revealed that the deficiency of vitamin C may lead to motor deficit, cognitive impairment and aberrant behaviors, whereas supplement of vitamin C has a potential preventive and therapeutic effect on mental illness, such as major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia, anxiety and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although several studies support a possible role of vitamin C against mental disorders, more researches are essential to accelerate the knowledge and investigate the mechanism in this field.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Han QQ ; Shen TT ; Wang F ; Wu PF ; Chen JG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11596-018-1840-2 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntioxidants/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAscorbic Acid/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nCentral Nervous System/drug effects\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/drug therapy/*prevention & control\r\nVitamins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAlzheimer's disease\r\nascorbic acid\r\nmajor depressive disorder\r\noxidative stress\r\nvitamin C","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Han QQ, Shen TT, Wang F, Wu PF, and Chen JG (2018) Preventive and Therapeutic Potential of Vitamin C in Mental Disorders..

Clinical evidence supports that the absence of vitamin C may be linked to depressive symptoms, but much less is known about the mechanism. Herein, we show that chronic stress disrupts the expression of ascorbic acid transporter, sodium-dependent vitamin C transport 2, and induces a deficiency in endogenous ascorbic acid in the medial prefrontal cortex, leading to depressive-like behaviors by disturbing redox-dependent DNA methylation reprogramming. Attractively, ascorbic acid (100 mg/kg-1000 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection, as bioequivalent of an intravenous drip dose of 0.48 g-4.8 g ascorbic acid per day in humans) produces rapid-acting antidepressant effects via triggering DNA demethylation catalyzed by ten-eleven translocation dioxygenases. In particular, the mechanistic studies by both transcriptome sequencing and methylation sequencing have shown that S100 calcium binding protein A4, a potentially protective factor against oxidative stress and brain injury, mediates the antidepressant activity of ascorbic acid via activating erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ErbB4)-brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway. Overall, our findings reveal a novel nutritional mechanism that couples stress to aberrant DNA methylation underlying depressive-like behaviors. Therefore, application of vitamin C may be a potential strategy for the treatment of depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Han QQ ; Wu PF ; Li YH ; Cao Y ; Chen JG ; Wang F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.redox.2022.102543 ","Keywords":"Ascorbic acid\r\nDepression\r\nOxidative stress\r\nS100 calcium binding protein A4\r\nSodium-dependent vitamin C transport 2","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Han QQ, Wu PF, Li YH, Cao Y, Chen JG, and Wang F (2022) SVCT2-mediated ascorbic acid uptake buffers stress responses via DNA hydroxymethylation reprogramming of S100 calcium-binding protein A4 gene..

Depression may affect 2% to 8% of children and adolescents, with a peak incidence around puberty. It may be self-limiting, but about 40% of affected children experience a recurrent attack, one third of affected children will make a suicide attempt, and 3% to 4% will die from suicide. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of complementary treatments for depression in children and adolescents? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview). RESULTS: At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 141 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 103 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 60 studies and the further review of 43 full publications. Of the 43 full articles evaluated, two systematic reviews were added at this update.

We therefore conducted this naturalistic prospective follow-up study. Our aim was to determine whether there were any associations between the vitamin B12 and folate level and the six-month treatment outcome in patients with major depressive disorder. Because vitamin B12 and folate deficiency may result in changes in haematological indices, including mean corpuscular volume, red blood cell count and hematocrit, we also examined whether these indices were associated with the treatment outcome. METHODS: Haematological indices, erythrocyte folate and serum vitamin B12 levels were determined in 115 outpatients with DSM-III-R major depressive disorder at baseline and serum vitamin B12 level again on six-month follow-up. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was also compiled, respectively. In the statistical analysis we used chi-squared test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, the Student's t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Higher vitamin B12 levels significantly associated with a better outcome. The association between the folate level and treatment outcome was weak and probably not independent. No relationship was found between haematological indices and the six-month outcome. CONCLUSION: The vitamin B12 level and the probability of recovery from major depression may be positively associated. Nevertheless, further studies are suggested to confirm this finding.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hintikka J ; Tolmunen T ; Tanskanen A ; Viinamäki H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1471-244X-3-17 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy\r\nErythrocytes/chemistry\r\nFemale\r\nFluoroimmunoassay\r\nFolic Acid/blood\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin B 12/*blood","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hintikka J, Tolmunen T, Tanskanen A, and Viinamäki H (2003) High vitamin B12 level and good treatment outcome may be associated in major depressive disorder..

METHODS: Serum 25OH vitamin D (25OHD) levels in 54 Swedish depressed adolescents were investigated. Subjects with vitamin D deficiency were given vitamin D(3) over 3 months (n = 48). To evaluate well-being and symptoms related to depression and vitamin D status, the WHO-5 well-being scale, the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ-S) and a vitamin D deficiency scale were used. RESULTS: Mean serum 25OHD in the depressed adolescents was 41 at baseline and 91 nmol/L (p < 0.001) after supplementation. Basal 25OHD levels correlated positively with well-being (p < 0.05). After vitamin D supplementation, well-being increased (p < 0.001) and there was a significant improvement in eight of the nine items in the vitamin D deficiency scale: depressed feeling (p < 0.001), irritability (p < 0.05), tiredness (p < 0.001), mood swings (p < 0.01), sleep difficulties (p < 0.01), weakness (p < 0.01), ability to concentrate (p < 0.05) and pain (p < 0.05). There was a significant amelioration of depression according to the MFQ-S (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study showed low levels of vitamin D in 54 depressed adolescents, positive correlation between vitamin D and well-being, and improved symptoms related to depression and vitamin D deficiency after vitamin D supplementation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Högberg G ; Gustafsson SA ; Hällström T ; Gustafsson T ; Klawitter B ; Petersson M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1651-2227.2012.02655.x ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nBiomarkers/blood\r\nCalcifediol/blood/*deficiency\r\nChild\r\nCholecalciferol/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/blood/drug therapy/*etiology\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nPsychological Tests\r\nSelf Report\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/blood/*complications/drug therapy\r\nVitamins/*therapeutic use\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Högberg G, Gustafsson SA, Hällström T, Gustafsson T, Klawitter B, and Petersson M (2012) Depressed adolescents in a case-series were low in vitamin D and depression was ameliorated by vitamin D supplementation..

Therefore, the minimum glutamate release from presynaptic nerve terminals is an important neuroprotective mechanism. OBJECTIVE: In this mini-review, we analyze the three B vitamins, namely vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), and vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), that affect the 4-aminopyridine (4- AP)-evoked glutamate release from presynaptic nerve terminal in rat and discuss their neuroprotective role. METHODS: In this study, the measurements include glutamate release, DiSC3(5), and Fura-2. RESULTS: The riboflavin, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin produced significant inhibitory effects on 4-aminopyridine-evoked glutamate release from rat cerebrocortical nerve terminals (synaptosomes) in a dose-dependent relationship. These presynaptic inhibitory actions of glutamate release are attributed to inhibition of physiologic Ca2+-dependent vesicular exocytosis but not Ca2+-independent nonvesicular release. These effects also did not affect membrane excitability, while diminished cytosolic (Ca2+)c through a reduction of direct Ca2+ influx via Cav2.2 (N-type) and Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) Ca2+ channels, rather than through indirect Ca2+induced Ca2+ release from ryanodine-sensitive intracellular stores. Furthermore, their effects were attenuated by GF109203X and Ro318220, two protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, suggesting suppression of PKC activity. Taken together, these results suggest that riboflavin, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin inhibit presynaptic vesicular glutamate release from rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes, through the depression Ca2+ influx via voltage- dependent Cav2.2 (N-type) and Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) Ca2+ channels, and PKC signaling cascade. CONCLUSION: Therefore, these B vitamins may reduce the strength of glutamatergic synaptic transmission and is of considerable importance as potential targets for therapeutic agents in glutamate- induced excitation-related diseases.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Huang SK ; Lu CW ; Lin TY ; Wang SJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1871527320666210902165739 ","Keywords":"4-Aminopyridine\r\nAnimals\r\nCalcium/metabolism\r\nCalcium Channels, N-Type\r\nCerebral Cortex/metabolism\r\nGlutamic Acid/*metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMembrane Potentials/drug effects\r\nPresynaptic Terminals/drug effects\r\nProtein Kinase C/metabolism\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSignal Transduction/drug effects\r\nSynaptic Transmission/*drug effects\r\nSynaptosomes/drug effects\r\nVitamin B Complex/*metabolism\r\nRiboflavin\r\ncyanocobalamin\r\nglutamate release\r\nnerve terminals\r\npresynaptic inhibition\r\npyridoxine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Huang SK, Lu CW, Lin TY, and Wang SJ (2022) Neuroprotective Role of the B Vitamins in the Modulation of the Central Glutamatergic Neurotransmission..

Our understanding of the pathophysiology of depression is no longer limited to the chemical imbalance of neurotransmitters, but also involves the interplay of proinflammatory modulators in the central nervous system, as well as folate metabolism. Additional factors such as stress and metabolic disorders also may contribute. Multiple inflammatory, metabolic, and genetic markers have been identified and may provide critical information to help clinicians individualize treatments for patients to achieve optimal outcomes. Recent advancements in research have clarified underlying causes of depression and have led to possible new avenues for adjunctive treatment. Among these is L-methylfolate, a medical food that is thought to enhance synthesis of monoamines (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine), suppress inflammation, and promote neural health. Clinical studies that assessed supplemental use of L-methylfolate in patients with usual care-resistant depression found that it resulted in improved outcomes. Patients with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-resistant depression, and particularly subgroups with biomarkers of inflammation or metabolic disorders or folate metabolism-related genetic polymorphisms (or ≥2 of these factors), had the best responses. Considering this, the goals of this review are to 1) highlight recent advances in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder as it pertains to folate and associated biomarkers and 2) establish the profiles of patients with depression who could benefit most from supplemental use of L-methylfolate.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jain R ; Manning S ; Cutler AJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S1092852919001469 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nTetrahydrofolates/metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression\r\nadjunctive therapy\r\nfolate\r\ninflammation\r\nserotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SERT and NET)\r\nserotonin reuptake inhibitor (SERT)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jain R, Manning S, and Cutler AJ (2020) Good, better, best: clinical scenarios for the use of L-methylfolate in patients with MDD..

METHODS: The following databases were search up to March 2019: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The quality of the relevant extracted data was assessed according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data were pooled by the use of the inverse variance method and expressed as mean difference with 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Eleven effect sizes from nine studies were included in the final analyses. A pooled analysis of 9 effect sizes showed a significant reduction in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score following supplementation with vitamin D [weighted mean difference (WMD): -3.91; 95% CI: -5.15 -2.66), I(2)= 85.9%]. Combining data from two available studies on the effects of vitamin D supplementation on Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) also revealed a significant reduction in this score following the intervention (WMD: -1.78; 95% CI: -2.28, -1.28). In addition, there were significant increase in glutathione (GSH) through 3 studies (WMD: 180.70; 95% CI: 6.76, 354.64), and in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) through 3 studies (WMD: 90.09; 95% CI: 56.36, 123.82) after vitamin D supplementation. Combining data from five studies, we found a significant reduction in C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations after vitamin D supplementation (WMD: -1.74; 95% CI: -2.82, -0.66). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the current meta-analysis demonstrated that taking vitamin D supplements among patients with psychiatric disorders had beneficial effects on BDI, PSQI, GSH, TAC and CRP levels, but did not affect other biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jamilian H ; Amirani E ; Milajerdi A ; Kolahdooz F ; Mirzaei H ; Zaroudi M ; Ghaderi A ; Asemi Z ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2019.109651 ","Keywords":"Biomarkers/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nInflammation/*metabolism\r\nMental Disorders/*metabolism\r\n*Oxidative Stress\r\n*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nVitamin D/*pharmacology\r\nInflammation\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nOxidative stress\r\nPsychiatric disorders\r\nVitamin D supplementation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jamilian H, Amirani E, Milajerdi A, Kolahdooz F, Mirzaei H, Zaroudi M, Ghaderi A, and Asemi Z (2019) The effects of vitamin D supplementation on mental health, and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with psychiatric disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials..

Recent studies suggest that nicotinamide riboside (NR) has neuroprotective properties. However, it is unknown whether NR can prevent or protect against alcohol-induced depression. Furthermore, it is unclear whether its therapeutic action involves changes in the composition of the gut microbiome. Here, we investigated the effects of NR in the mouse model of alcohol-induced depression. Treatment with NR improved the alcohol-induced depressive behaviour in mice. In addition, NR decreased the number of activated microglia in the hippocampus, and it reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10 and TGF-β) cytokines in the brain of mice with alcohol-induced depression. Furthermore, NR significantly upregulated BDNF and diminished the inhibition of the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signalling pathway in the hippocampus of these mice. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that, compared with control and NR-treated mice, the gut microbiome richness and composition were significantly altered in the depressed mice. Spearman's correlation analysis showed that differential gut bacterial genera correlated with the levels of inflammation-related cytokines and BDNF in the brain. After faecal microbiota transplantation, cognitive behaviours, microglial activity, levels of cytokines and BDNF, and activation state of the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signalling pathway (which is downstream of the BDNF receptor, TrkB) in recipient mice were similar to those in donor mice. Collectively, our findings show that NR dietary supplementation protects against alcohol-induced depression-like behaviours, possibly by altering the composition of the gut microbiota.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jiang Y ; Liu Y ; Gao M ; Xue M ; Wang Z ; Liang H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1039/c9fo01780a ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*metabolism\r\nCytokines/metabolism\r\nDepression/chemically induced/*therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nEthanol/*adverse effects\r\nGastrointestinal Microbiome/*drug effects\r\nHippocampus/cytology/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nMicroglia/cytology/*drug effects\r\nNiacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use\r\nPyridinium Compounds\r\nRNA, Ribosomal, 16S","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jiang Y, Liu Y, Gao M, Xue M, Wang Z, and Liang H (2020) Nicotinamide riboside alleviates alcohol-induced depression-like behaviours in C57BL/6J mice by altering the intestinal microbiota associated with microglial activation and BDNF expression..

METHODS: The subjects were 514 adults with more 30 years of experience as office workers in the city of Seoul. Lifestyle risk factors, obesity indices, physical fitness, and serum vitamin D levels were assessed with a standardized protocol. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to assess depression status. Vitamin D status was assessed by measuring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Based on the BDI scores, participants were classified into no depression (ND, BDI ≤9), mild depression (MiD, 10≤BDI≤15), and moderate depression (MoD, 16≤BDI≤23) groups. RESULTS: Compared with the high cardiorespriatory fitness group, the low cardiorespiratory fitness (men OR=2.618, women OR=1.596) an middle cardiorespiratory fitness group (men OR=1.256, women OR=1.110) had significantly higher odds ratio for having depressive symptoms, even after adjustment for age, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, alcohol intake, smoking, body mass index (BMI), percent body fat (%BF), and waist circumference (WC). Compared with the insufficient or deficient vitamin D group, the sufficient vitamin D group had significantly lower odds ratios for having depressive symptoms (men OR=0.121, women OR=0.114), even after adjustment for age, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, alcohol intake, smoking, BMI, %BF, and WC. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation and outdoor activities should be key components of a lifestyle intervention against office workers' depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jin Y ; Ha C ; Hong H ; Kang H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.7570/jomes.2017.26.1.52 ","Keywords":"Depression\r\nObesity\r\nOffice work\r\nPhysical fitness\r\nVitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jin Y, Ha C, Hong H, and Kang H (2017) The Relationship between Depressive Symptoms and Modifiable Lifestyle Risk Factors in Office Workers..

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study and randomized double blind controlled trial of 20,000 or 40,000 IU vitamin D per week versus placebo for 1 year. SETTING: A total of 441 subjects (body mass index 28-47 kg m(-2), 159 men and 282 women, aged 21-70 years) recruited by advertisements or from the out-patient clinic at the University Hospital of North Norway. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score with subscales 1-13 and 14-21. RESULTS: Subjects with serum 25(OH)D levels < 40 nmol L(-1) scored significantly higher (more depressive traits) than those with serum 25(OH)D levels > or = 40 nmol L(-1) on the BDI total [6.0 (0-23) versus 4.5 (0-28) (median and range)] and the BDI subscale 1-13 [2.0 (0-15) versus 1.0 (0-29.5)] (P < 0.05). In the two groups given vitamin D, but not in the placebo group, there was a significant improvement in BDI scores after 1 year. There was a significant decrease in serum parathyroid hormone in the two vitamin D groups without a concomitant increase in serum calcium. CONCLUSIONS: It appears to be a relation between serum levels of 25(OH)D and symptoms of depression. Supplementation with high doses of vitamin D seems to ameliorate these symptoms indicating a possible causal relationship.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jorde R ; Sneve M ; Figenschau Y ; Svartberg J ; Waterloo K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2796.2008.02008.x ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nBiomarkers/blood\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/*etiology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nObesity/drug therapy/psychology\r\nOverweight/*drug therapy/*psychology\r\nParathyroid Hormone/blood\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nStatistics, Nonparametric\r\nVitamin D/*administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/blood\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/complications/drug therapy/psychology\r\nVitamins/*administration & dosage\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jorde R, Sneve M, Figenschau Y, Svartberg J, and Waterloo K (2008) Effects of vitamin D supplementation on symptoms of depression in overweight and obese subjects: randomized double blind trial..

Residents of southern Alberta were invited to participate in a study on the potential benefit of nutrient supplements following a natural disaster. Fifty-six adults aged 23-66 were randomised to receive a single nutrient (vitamin D, n=17), a few-nutrients formula (B-Complex, n=21), or a broad-spectrum mineral/vitamin formula (BSMV, n=18). Self-reported changes in depression, anxiety and stress were monitored for six weeks. Although all groups showed substantial decreases on all measures, those consuming the B-Complex and the BSMV formulas showed significantly greater improvement in stress and anxiety compared with those consuming the single nutrient, with large effect sizes (Cohen's d range 0.76-1.08). There were no group differences between those consuming the B-Complex and BSMV. The use of nutrient formulas with multiple minerals and/or vitamins to minimise stress associated with natural disasters is now supported by three studies.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on depression severity, serum 25(OH)D, and some neurotransmitters in patients with mild to moderate depression. METHODS: An 8-week double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted on 56 subjects with mild to moderate depression, aged 43.0 ± 1.15yrs. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups: intervention (50,000 IU cholecalciferol/2wks) and control (placebo). Biochemical parameters (serum 25(OH)D, iPTH, oxytocin and platelet serotonin), and depression severity (Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II(1))) were initially and finally assessed. RESULTS: Following intervention, significant changes were observed in the intervention group compared to the controls: 25(OH)D concentrations increased (+40.83±28.57 vs. +5.14±23.44 nmol/L, P<0.001) and BDI scores decreased (-11.75±6.40 vs. -3.61±10.40, P = 0.003). Oxytocin concentrations were significantly reduced in controls (-6.49±13.69 ng/mL, P = 0.01), but between -group differences were insignificant. Within- and between-group differences of platelet serotonin concentrations were not significant; however, the increment in controls was higher (+0.86±10.82 vs. +0.26±9.38 ng/mL, P = 0.83). LIMITATIONS: Study duration may not reflect the long-term effects of vitamin D on depression. It seems necessary to assess tryptophan-hydroxylasetypes1&2 in relation to vitamin D in serotonin pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Eight-week supplementation with 50,000 IU/2wks vitamin D, elevated 25(OH)D concentration of subjects with mild to moderate depression and significantly improved their depression severity. However, there was no evidence that the anti-depressive effect of vitamin D supplementation is mediated by the measured neurotransmitters.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kaviani M ; Nikooyeh B ; Zand H ; Yaghmaei P ; Neyestani TR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2020.03.029 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*Depression/drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nHumans\r\nNeurotransmitter Agents\r\nVitamin D\r\n*Vitamin D Deficiency\r\nVitamins\r\nDepression\r\nOxytocin\r\nRCT\r\nSerotonin\r\nVitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kaviani M, Nikooyeh B, Zand H, Yaghmaei P, and Neyestani TR (2020) Effects of vitamin D supplementation on depression and some involved neurotransmitters..

This study was, therefore, conducted to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on serum 25(OH)D concentration, depression severity and some pro-inflammatory biomarkers in patients with mild to moderate depression. METHODS: An 8-week double-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT) was performed on 56 (18-60 yrs) patients with mild to moderate depression, randomly assigned to intervention (50,000 IU cholecalciferol 2wks<sup>-1</sup>) and control (placebo) groups. Serum 25(OH)D, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), interlukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and depression severity (Beck Depression Inventory-II) (BDI-II)) were initially and finally assessed. RESULTS: At the end point, statistically significant changes were observed only in intervention group as compared with controls including increased 25(OH)D concentration (+ 40.83 ± 28.57 vs. + 5.14 ± 23.44 nmol L<sup>-1</sup>, P &lt; 0.001) and decreased depression severity (-11.75 ± 6.40 vs. -3.61 ± 10.40, P = 0.003). No significant within- or between group differences were observed in serum IL-1β, IL-6 and hs-CRP concentrations. CONCLUSION: Increased circulating 25(OH)D concentrations following 8-week vitamin D supplementation (50,000 IU 2wks<sup>-1</sup>) resulted in a significant decrease in BDI-II scores in patients with mild to moderate depression. However, this effect was independent of the serum concentrations of the studied inflammatory biomarkers.

Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide health problem, particularly in children and women. Gestational or developmental vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. This study examined the effect of maternal vitamin D dietary manipulations and treadmill exercise on anxiety-and depressive-related behaviors, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) in adult male offspring born to vitamin D-deficient diet (VDD)-fed dams. METHODS AND RESULTS: Female rats were provided standard diet (SD) or VDD for six weeks and then were treated with SD (started a week before mating throughout gestation and lactation) and treadmill exercise (a week before mating until gestational day 20). Male offspring were separated on postnatal day (PND) 21 and fed SD chow until PND90. Our results demonstrated that maternal vitamin D deficiency increased anxiety and depression-related behaviors, increased levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in serum, and decreased prefrontal protein expressions of BDNF and VDR in adult male offspring. However, maternal vitamin D supplementation and treadmill exercise reversed these changes alone or in combination. CONCLUSION: It seems that developmental vitamin D deficiency disrupts brain development and has a long-lasting effect on VDR and BDNF signaling in the rat brain resulting in neuropsychiatric disorders in offspring. Therefore, vitamin D supplementation and physical exercise are reasonable strategies to prevent these neurobehavioral impairments.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kazemi F ; Babri S ; Keyhanmehr P ; Farid-Habibi M ; Rad SN ; Farajdokht F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/1028415X.2022.2059203 ","Keywords":"Anxiety\r\nBDNF\r\nDepression\r\nOffspring\r\nVDR\r\nVitamin D deficiency\r\nVitamin D supplementation\r\ninflammation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kazemi F, Babri S, Keyhanmehr P, Farid-Habibi M, Rad SN, and Farajdokht F (2022) Maternal vitamin D supplementation and treadmill exercise attenuated vitamin D deficiency-induced anxiety-and depressive-like behaviors in adult male offspring rats..

Serotonin (5-HT) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of IBS, and its production and secretion are increased from the lumen due to stress and inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on the pathogenesis of diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Seventy-four IBS-D patients (age: 18-65 y) participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial study from February 2017 to May 2018, at Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Subjects were allocated into two groups receiving 50,000 IU/week of vitamin D3 or placebo for 9 weeks. IBS severity score system (IBS-SSS), IBS-quality of life questionnaire (QoL), hospital anxiety and depression Scale (HADs), visceral sensitivity index (VSI) and serum 25(OH) vitamin D3, serotonin, 5-hydroxy-indole acetic acid and ratio of 5-HIAA/5-HT were evaluated before and after the interventions. Symptoms severity, QoL, HADs-depression, and VSI score improved significantly in the vitamin D group as compared to the placebo group (P-values: <0.001, 0.049, 0.023, and 0.008; respectively). There were no significant differences in abdominal bloating, HADs-anxiety, serum 5-HT, 5-HIAA, and 5-HIAA/5-HT between the two groups at the end of the study. Based on our results, we recommend serum vitamin D be evaluated in the process of treatment of these patients to ameliorate symptoms and quality life of IBS-D patients with vitamin D deficiency and/or insufficiency.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Khalighi Sikaroudi M; Mokhtare M ; Shidfar F ; Janani L ; Faghihi Kashani A; Masoodi M ; Agah S ; Dehnad A ; Shidfar S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.17179/excli2020-2247 ","Keywords":"clinical symptoms\r\nirritable bowel syndrome\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nserotonin\r\nvitamin D3","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Khalighi Sikaroudi M, Mokhtare M, Shidfar F, Janani L, Faghihi Kashani A, Masoodi M, Agah S, Dehnad A, and Shidfar S (2020) Effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on clinical symptoms, quality of life, serum serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), 5-hydroxy-indole acetic acid, and ratio of 5-HIAA/5-HT in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: A randomized clinical trial..

The low medication compliance rates in depressed patients as well as the high recurrence rate of the disease can bring up the nutrition-related factors as a potential preventive or treatment agent for depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between dietary patterns and depression via the intermediary role of the serum folate and vitamin B12, total homocysteine, tryptophan, and tryptophan/competing amino acids ratio. METHODS: This was an individually matched case-control study in which 110 patients with depression and 220 healthy individuals, who completed a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire were recruited. We selected the depressed patients from three districts in Tehran through non-probable convenience sampling from which healthy individuals were selected, as well. The samples selection and data collection were performed during October 2012 to June 2013. In addition, to measure the serum biomarkers 43 patients with depression and 43 healthy people were randomly selected from the study population. To diagnose depression the criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, were utilized. RESULTS: The findings suggest that the healthy dietary pattern was significantly associated with a reduced odds of depression (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.61-0.93) whereas the unhealthy dietary pattern increased it (OR: 1.382, CI: 1.116-1.71). The mediation analysis showed that the healthy dietary pattern was associated with a reduced risk of depression via increased serum levels of the folate and vitamin B12; however, the unhealthy dietary pattern was associated with increased risk of depression via decreased serum levels of folate and vitamin B12, based on tree adjusted logistic regression models. CONCLUSION: Dietary patterns may be associated with depression by changing the serum levels of folate and vitamin B12. Further studies are required to confirm the mechanism.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Khosravi M ; Sotoudeh G ; Amini M ; Raisi F ; Mansoori A ; Hosseinzadeh M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12888-020-2455-2 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nCase-Control Studies\r\nDepression/*blood/diagnosis\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*blood/diagnosis\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/*blood\r\nHomocysteine/blood\r\nHumans\r\nIran\r\nLogistic Models\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nTryptophan/blood\r\nVitamin B 12/*blood\r\nYoung Adult\r\nDepression\r\nDietary pattern\r\nEpidemiology\r\nFolate\r\nMediation analysis\r\nTotal Homocysteine\r\nTryptophan\r\nVitamin B12","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Khosravi M, Sotoudeh G, Amini M, Raisi F, Mansoori A, and Hosseinzadeh M (2020) The relationship between dietary patterns and depression mediated by serum levels of Folate and vitamin B12..

Anxiety/depression is the most important and prevalent neuropsychiatric complication of stroke survivors. Brain injury and the presence of malnutrition after stroke contribute to metabolic status and clinical outcome of patients. We examined the level of nutrition intake in stroke patients according to their degree of anxiety/depression. The data were obtained from 2013 to 2015 through the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). Study subjects were categorized to either a group having no problem of anxiety/depression (n = 274) or a group having a problem of anxiety or depression (n = 104). The EuroQoL-5 Dimensions Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D) index score was derived from the first description of an individual health status based on the EQ-5D classification system, including mobility, self-care, usual daily activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The mean age was 67.4 years in the normal group and 68.0 years in the anxiety or depression group. In the anxiety or depression group, 39.4% were men vs. 53.3% in the normal group. The total energy intake (p = 0.013), riboflavin (p = 0.041), and niacin (p = 0.038) was significantly higher in stroke patients with no anxiety/depression than those in stroke patients with having an anxiety/depression. The group having no problem of anxiety/depression had significantly higher EQ-5D index compared to the group having a problem of anxiety/depression group (p < 0.001) had. The results suggest the association between nutrition intake, usual activities and pain/discomfort status in the stroke patients with having an anxiety/depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kim Y ; Kim MC ; Park HS ; Cho IH ; Paik JK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.7762/cnr.2018.7.1.11 ","Keywords":"Anxiety\r\nDepression\r\nKNHANES\r\nNutrition surveys\r\nStroke","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kim Y, Kim MC, Park HS, Cho IH, and Paik JK (2018) Association of the Anxiety/Depression with Nutrition Intake in Stroke Patients..

Broad-spectrum multi-vitamin/mineral approaches have been found to alleviate a number of psychiatric symptoms. We investigated the effects of a nutrient intervention program, which includes optimizing vitamin D levels, on depression and anxiety outcomes from community-based program. METHODS: We evaluated self-reported health measures of depression and anxiety collected as part of a community-based program focused on optimizing overall health through nutritional supplementation, education and lifestyle advice. RESULTS: Data were collected from 16,020 participants, with measures including European Quality of Life Five Dimensions (EQ-5D) and Targeted Symptoms List (TSL) providing self-reported depression and anxiety. More than 56% of participants were identified as having elevated levels of depression and anxiety at baseline as reported on the EQ-5D. After one year in the program, 49.2% (n = 7878) of participants who reported any level of depression or anxiety at baseline reported improvement at follow-up. Of those who reported severe/extreme depression at baseline (n = 829), 97.2% reported improvement after one year. Regression analyses revealed a significant association of improvement in depression and anxiety with higher vitamin D status (>100 nmol/L) and more strenuous physical activity. CONCLUSION: Overall, people from the general population who suffer from mood and anxiety problems may benefit from improved nutritional status achieved with nutritional supplements.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kimball SM ; Mirhosseini N ; Rucklidge J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu10020152 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAnxiety/epidemiology/prevention & control/psychology/*therapy\r\nAnxiety Disorders/epidemiology/prevention & control/psychology/*therapy\r\nCanada/epidemiology\r\nCase-Control Studies\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDepression/epidemiology/prevention & control/psychology/*therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/epidemiology/prevention & control/psychology/*therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nElectronic Health Records\r\nExercise\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice\r\n*Health Promotion\r\nHealthy Lifestyle\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMicronutrients/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPrevalence\r\nProgram Evaluation\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nQuality of Life\r\nYoung Adult\r\nanxiety\r\ndepression\r\nmental health\r\nmultivitamin/multimineral\r\nnutritional supplements\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kimball SM, Mirhosseini N, and Rucklidge J (2018) Database Analysis of Depression and Anxiety in a Community Sample-Response to a Micronutrient Intervention..

Intracellular Vit C helps maintain integrity and function of several processes in the central nervous system (CNS), including neuronal maturation and differentiation, myelin formation, synthesis of catecholamine, modulation of neurotransmission and antioxidant protection. The importance of Vit C for CNS function has been proven by the fact that targeted deletion of the sodium-vitamin C co-transporter in mice results in widespread cerebral hemorrhage and death on post-natal day one. Since neurological diseases are characterized by increased free radical generation and the highest concentrations of Vit C in the body are found in the brain and neuroendocrine tissues, it is suggested that Vit C may change the course of neurological diseases and display potential therapeutic roles. The aim of this review is to update the current state of knowledge of the role of vitamin C on neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic sclerosis, as well as psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. The particular attention is attributed to understanding of the mechanisms underlying possible therapeutic properties of ascorbic acid in the presented disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kocot J ; Luchowska-Kocot D ; Kiełczykowska M ; Musik I ; Kurzepa J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu9070659 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntioxidants/administration & dosage\r\nAscorbic Acid/*administration & dosage/blood\r\nBrain/drug effects/metabolism\r\nCentral Nervous System/drug effects/metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/*metabolism\r\nNeurodegenerative Diseases/*metabolism\r\nObservational Studies as Topic\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nAlzheimer’s disease\r\nHuntington’s disease\r\nParkinson’s disease\r\namyotrophic sclerosis\r\nanxiety\r\ndepression\r\nmultiple sclerosis\r\nschizophrenia\r\nvitamin C","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kocot J, Luchowska-Kocot D, Kiełczykowska M, Musik I, and Kurzepa J (2017) Does Vitamin C Influence Neurodegenerative Diseases and Psychiatric Disorders?.

Sucrose preference (SPT), forced swimming (FST) and open-field (OFT) tests were conducted to examine the depression-like state. Serum corticosterone/adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) levels and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin (NT)-3/NT-4 expressions by ELISA kits and/or western blotting were determined to assess the possible mechanisms of the vitamin D(3) effects on the depression-like profile in long-term OVX rats subjected to CUMS. The results showed that vitamin D(3) (5.0 mg/kg), as well as fluoxetine treatment, considerably reversed the depression-like state in the SPT and FST, decreased serum corticosterone/ACTH levels, and increased BDNF and NT-3/NT-4 levels in the hippocampus of long-term OVX rats compared to OVX rats with CUMS (p < 0.05). Thus, a high dose of vitamin D(3) (5.0 mg/kg sc) could improve the depression-like profile in long-term OVX adult female rats subjected to the CUMS procedure, which might be mediated by the regulation of BDNF and the NT-3/NT-4 signaling pathways in the hippocampus, as well as the corticosterone/ACTH levels of the blood serum.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Koshkina A ; Dudnichenko T ; Baranenko D ; Fedotova J ; Drago F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu11081726 ","Keywords":"Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/blood\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nBiomarkers/blood\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*blood\r\nCholecalciferol/*pharmacology\r\nChronic Disease\r\nCorticosterone/blood\r\nDepression/blood/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFeeding Behavior/drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nHippocampus/*drug effects/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nLocomotion/drug effects\r\nNerve Growth Factors/*blood\r\nNeurotrophin 3/*blood\r\n*Ovariectomy\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nStress, Psychological/blood/*drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology\r\nTime Factors\r\nBDNF\r\nNT-3\r\nNT-4\r\nchronic unpredictable mild stress\r\nlong-term ovariectomy\r\nvitamin D3","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Koshkina A, Dudnichenko T, Baranenko D, Fedotova J, and Drago F (2019) Effects of Vitamin D(3) in Long-Term Ovariectomized Rats Subjected to Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress: BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4 Implications..

Depression is common among MS patients. In patients without MS, lower vitamin D levels were associated with higher depression scores and severity. Supplementation of vitamin D was associated with significant improvement of depressive symptoms. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the relation between vitamin D levels and depression scores, and the effect of vitamin D replacement on the depressive symptoms in patients with MS. METHODS: The study included 35 patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Neurological, psychiatric, and radiological evaluations were done. Participants received 10,000 IU of cholecalciferol daily for 12 months. RESULTS: Vitamin D level was low at baseline. Depressive symptoms were high at baseline and improved with vitamin D replacement although, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was not improving. Vitamin D levels correlated negatively with depressive symptoms at baseline and follow up periods. CONCLUSION: Lower vitamin D levels are associated with higher depressive scores, and vitamin D replacement could improve depressive symptoms in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kotb MA ; Kamal AM ; Aldossary NM ; Bedewi MA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2019.01.029 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCholecalciferol/pharmacology\r\nDepression/blood/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMultiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/blood/*drug therapy/*physiopathology\r\n*Outcome Assessment, Health Care\r\nVitamin D/administration & dosage/*blood/*pharmacology\r\nDepression\r\nMultiple sclerosis\r\nVitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kotb MA, Kamal AM, Aldossary NM, and Bedewi MA (2019) Effect of vitamin D replacement on depression in multiple sclerosis patients..

Despite being different disorders, symptoms of depression and anxiety frequently overlap in individuals, making them difficult to diagnose and treat adequately. Therefore, compounds capable of exerting beneficial effects against both disorders are of special interest. Noteworthily, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with an increased risk of developing depression and anxiety, and individuals with these psychiatric conditions have low serum levels of this vitamin. Indeed, in the last few years, vitamin D has gained attention for its many functions that go beyond its effects on calcium-phosphorus metabolism. Particularly, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, pro-neurogenic, and neuromodulatory properties seem to contribute to its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. Therefore, in this review, we highlight the main mechanisms that may underlie the potential antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of vitamin D. In addition, we discuss preclinical and clinical studies that support the therapeutic potential of this vitamin for the management of these disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kouba BR ; Camargo A ; Gil-Mohapel J ; Rodrigues ALS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ijms23137077 ","Keywords":"*Anti-Anxiety Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety/drug therapy\r\nAnxiety Disorders/drug therapy\r\nDepression/drug therapy/psychology\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nVitamin D/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\n*Vitamin D Deficiency/complications/drug therapy\r\nVitamins/therapeutic use\r\nanti-inflammatory effect\r\nanxiety\r\ndepression\r\nneuromodulator\r\npro-neurogenic effect\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kouba BR, Camargo A, Gil-Mohapel J, and Rodrigues ALS (2022) Molecular Basis Underlying the Therapeutic Potential of Vitamin D for the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety..

Thus, this study investigated the time-course antidepressant-like response of vitamin D(3) in female and male mice and the possible role of BDNF/TrkB signaling in this response. The repeated (7 and 21 days), but not acute (60 min), administration of vitamin D(3) (2.5 μg/kg, p.o.) exerted an antidepressant-like effect in female and male mice subjected to the tail suspension test, without altering the basal locomotor activity in the open-field test. Notably, vitamin D(3) caused a similar time-dependent antidepressant-like effect in male and female mice, suggesting that this behavioral response in the tail suspension test might not be affected by sex differences. Vitamin D(3) administration for 21 days, but not for 7 days or 1 h, augmented BDNF levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice. No effects on phospho-CREB/CREB levels were detected in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex after chronic vitamin D(3) administration. Additionally, vitamin D(3) increased TrkB, GluA1, and PSD-95 levels in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus. Furthermore, an upregulation of synapsin level was observed in both brain regions after vitamin D(3) administration. These findings reinforce and extend the notion that vitamin D(3) is effective to produce antidepressant-like responses in male and female mice and provide novel evidence that this effect could be associated with BDNF/TrkB-related synaptic protein synthesis. Finally, vitamin D(3) could be a feasible nutritional strategy for the management of depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kouba BR ; Torrá ACNC ; Camargo A ; Rodrigues ALS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11011-022-01115-0 ","Keywords":"BDNF\r\nCholecalciferol\r\nDepression\r\nSynaptic proteins\r\nVitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kouba BR, Torrá ACNC, Camargo A, and Rodrigues ALS (2022) The antidepressant-like effect elicited by vitamin D(3) is associated with BDNF/TrkB-related synaptic protein synthesis..

Folate is a co-factor in one-carbon metabolism during which it promotes the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine, a highly reactive sulfur-containing amino acid. Methionine may then be converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the principal methyl donor in most biosynthetic methylation reactions. On the cellular level, folate deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia exert multiple detrimental effects. These include induction of DNA damage, uracil misincorporation into DNA and altered patterns of DNA methylation. Low folate status and elevated homocysteine increase the generation of reactive oxygen species and contribute to excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction which may lead to apoptosis. Strong epidemiological and experimental evidence links derangements of one-carbon metabolism to vascular, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease, including most prominently cerebral ischemia, Alzheimer's dementia and depression. Although firm evidence from controlled clinical trials is largely lacking, B-vitamin supplementation and homocysteine reduction may have a role especially in the primary prevention of stroke and dementia as well as as an adjunct to antidepressant pharmacotherapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kronenberg G ; Colla M ; Endres M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/156652409787847146 ","Keywords":"Aging/physiology\r\nAlzheimer Disease/metabolism\r\nAnimals\r\nBrain/metabolism\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDementia, Vascular/metabolism\r\nDepression/metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/chemistry/*metabolism\r\nHomocysteine/chemistry/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMental Disorders/*metabolism\r\nMolecular Structure\r\nNeurodegenerative Diseases/*metabolism\r\nNeuronal Plasticity/physiology\r\nStroke/metabolism\r\nVitamin B Complex/chemistry/*metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kronenberg G, Colla M, and Endres M (2009) Folic acid, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease..

Since recent GWAS data and experimental studies associated RXR-mediated signaling with depression, we explored here the relevance of RXR and vitamin A5/X-mediated signaling in the control of stress adaptation and depressive-like behaviors in mice. We found that compromised availability of 9CDHRA in Rbp1-/- mice was associated with increased despair in the forced swim and anhedonia in the sucrose preference test. 9CDHRA similarly to synthetic RXR agonist, BMS649, normalized despair behaviors in Rbp1-/- but not Rxrγ-/- mice, supporting involvement of RXR signaling in anti-despair activity of these ligands. Importantly, similarly to BMS649, the 9CDHRA and its nutritional-precursor, 9-cis-13,14-dihydroretinol (vitamin A5/X alcohol), prevented development of depressive-like behaviors in mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress, revealing the beneficial role of RXRs and its endogenous ligand in stress adaptation process.

Despite the recent recognition of its extra-hepatic actions, the current Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin K is based on the amount necessary for maintaining the normal blood coagulation in many countries. To define the Dietary Reference Intake for vitamin K, appropriate biomarkers well-reflecting the vitamin K status are essential. Unfortunately, however, no markers are currently available with properties enabling us to properly define the vitamin K status; i.g., no interference by other factors and the presence of widely approved cut-off values. Thus, Adequate Intake is determined, which is an index based on the representative dietary intake data from healthy individuals. Recently, epidemiological studies have been reported regarding the relationship between vitamin K and noncommunicable diseases including osteoporotic fracture. Furthermore, studies focusing on the relationship between vitamin K intake and metabolic syndrome, physical function, depression, cognition, and all-cause mortality have become available, although limited in number. This review summarizes the recent findings in favor of the novel functions of vitamin K. More epidemiological studies are needed to define the appropriate vitamin K intake value based on the prevention of various disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kuwabara A ; Uenishi K ; Tanaka K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3164/jcbn.20-64 ","Keywords":"Dietary Reference Intakes\r\nall-cause mortality\r\nnoncommunicable diseases\r\nvitamin K intake","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kuwabara A, Uenishi K, and Tanaka K (2021) Vitamin K intake and health, consideration from the epidemiological studies..

An extreme form of seasonality is manifested as the clinical syndrome of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) with carbohydrate craving, hypersomnia, lethargy, and changes in circadian rhythms also evident. It has been suggested that seasonality and the symptoms of SAD may be due to changing levels of vitamin D3, the hormone of sunlight, leading to changes in brain serotonin. Forty-four healthy subjects were given 400 IU, 800 IU, or no vitamin D3 for 5 days during late winter in a random double-blind study. Results on a self-report measure showed that vitamin D3 significantly enhanced positive affect and there was some evidence of a reduction in negative affect.

SUBJECTS/METHODS: We examined the association between change in self-reported depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) at different timepoints during and following pregnancy and self-reported folic acid supplementation during pregnancy in a prospective cohort of 6809 pregnant women. We also tested whether there was a main effect of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotype (which influences folate metabolism and intracellular levels of folate metabolites and homocysteine) on change in depression scores, and carried out our analysis of folic acid supplementation and depression stratifying by genotype. RESULTS: We found no strong evidence that folic acid supplementation reduced the risk of depression during pregnancy and up to 8 months after pregnancy. However, we did find evidence to suggest that folic acid supplements during pregnancy protected against depression 21 months postpartum, and that this effect was more pronounced in those with the MTHFR C677T TT genotype (change in depression score from 8 months to 21 months postpartum among TT individuals was 0.66 (95% CI=0.31-1.01) among those not taking supplements, compared with -1.02 (95% CI=-2.22-0.18) among those taking supplements at 18 weeks pregnancy, P(difference)=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Low folate is unlikely to be an important risk factor for depression during pregnancy and for postpartum depression, but may be a risk factor for depression outside of pregnancy, especially among women with the MTHFR C677T TT genotype.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lewis SJ ; Araya R ; Leary S ; Smith GD ; Ness A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/ejcn.2011.136 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/etiology/genetics/*prevention & control\r\nDepression, Postpartum/genetics/*prevention & control\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nFolic Acid Deficiency/*complications/drug therapy\r\nGenotype\r\nHumans\r\nMethylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics\r\nPolymorphism, Genetic\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/genetics/prevention & control\r\nProspective Studies\r\nSelf Report\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lewis SJ, Araya R, Leary S, Smith GD, and Ness A (2012) Folic acid supplementation during pregnancy may protect against depression 21 months after pregnancy, an effect modified by MTHFR C677T genotype..

The effect of improved nutrition, particularly with dietary supplements, on depression may provide an alternative to standard medical treatment. Some studies have shown that certain nutrients (e.g., inositol and S-adenosyl methionine) are effective at improving depressed mood, although the results are not unequivocal. The current study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a vitamin B complex nutritional supplement (Max Stress B) for improving depressive and anxiety symptoms according to the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories (BDI and BAI) in 60 adults diagnosed with major depression or other forms of depressive disorders. Secondary outcomes included quality of life according to the SF-36. Participants were assessed at baseline and 30- and 60-day followups. Max Stress B showed significant and more continuous improvements in depressive and anxiety symptoms, compared to placebo. Additionally, Max Stress B showed significant improvement on the mental health scale of the SF-36 compared to placebo. Thus, we showed modest utility of Max Stress B to improve mood symptoms and mental health quality of life in adults with depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lewis JE ; Tiozzo E ; Melillo AB ; Leonard S ; Chen L ; Mendez A ; Woolger JM ; Konefal J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1155/2013/621453 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lewis JE, Tiozzo E, Melillo AB, Leonard S, Chen L, Mendez A, Woolger JM, and Konefal J (2013) The effect of methylated vitamin B complex on depressive and anxiety symptoms and quality of life in adults with depression..

Thirty-two-week-old female mice were randomly allocated into two groups: the 32 W+VD group (receiving 10 IU/g body weight vitamin D(3) dissolved in 200 μl corn oil per day), and the 32 W group (receiving 200 μl corn oil per day) for one week before mating with ten-week-old male mice. Another group of eight-week-old female mice was given 200 μl corn oil for the same period of time and set as normal childbearing age controls (8 W group). The pregnancy outcomes were recorded and the offspring at the age of 6 weeks were subjected to behavioral tests. Finally, the expression level and distribution of neural cell markers in the offspring's hippocampus were detected by immunofluorescence. Mice with AMA had higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcome, smaller litter size, and offspring development. Vitamin D supplementation in mice with AMA promoted offspring development. AMA and maternal vitamin D supplementation before pregnancy did not change the anxiety and depression of young adult offspring. AMA impaired spatial learning and memory function of offspring while vitamin D supplementation before pregnancy rescued the impairment. AMA decreased NEFH (neurofilament protein) and MAP2 (microtubule binding protein) expression in offspring hippocampus, but vitamin D supplementation before pregnancy promoted NEFH and MAP2. Vitamin D supplementation before pregnancy can rescue the impaired learning and memory in offspring born to AMA mice. Our results highlight the significant impact of maternal vitamin D supplementation on the cognitive function of offspring.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Li D ; Wang K ; Yang Z ; Li H ; Wang S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Vitamin D supplementation\r\nadvanced maternal age\r\noffspring’s cognitive function\r\npregnancy outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Li D, Wang K, Yang Z, Li H, and Wang S (2021) Vitamin D supplementation in mice with advanced maternal age and cognitive function of the offspring..

RESULTS: A total of 3054 midlife women aged 42-52 years were included in the present study. In overall midlife women, pro-A carotenoid intake was inversely associated with depressive symptoms (CES-D score ≥16). In premenopausal women, pro-A carotenoid intake was inversely associated with depressive symptoms after adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, total family income, education, physical activity, BMI, use of antidepressant, dietary total caloric, protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamin C, vitamin E and pro-A carotenes in model 1.

Its deficiency is associated with numerous brain conditions. As such, VD and its variants are routinely taken by a broad of groups with/without known VD deficiency. In contrast, the harmful effects of VD overdose have been poorly studied. Similarly, the developmental stage-specific VD deficiency and overdose have been rarely explored. In the present work, we showed that postnatal VD supplementation enhanced the motor function transiently in the young adult, but not in the older one. Postnatal VD intake abnormality did not impact the anxiety and depressive behavior but was detrimental to spatial learning and hippocampus-dependent memory. At the molecular level we failed to observe an obvious and constant change with the neural development and activity-related genes examined. However, disrupted developmental expression dynamics were observed for most of the genes, suggesting that the altered neural development dynamics and therefore aberrant adult plasticity might underlie the functional deficits.

The acute oral treatment with alpha-tocopherol at the doses of 30 and 100mg/kg reduced the immobility time in the FST and in the TST. A single i.c.v. administration of alpha-tocopheryl phosphate, a water-soluble analogue of alpha-tocopherol, also reduced the immobility time in the FST (0.1 and 1 nmol/site) and in the TST (0.1 nmol/site). In addition, the long-term treatment (28 days) with alpha-tocopherol (10mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced the immobility time in the FST. Moreover, a subeffective dose of alpha-T (10mg/kg, p.o.) potentiated the effect of fluoxetine (10mg/kg, p.o.) in the FST. The long-term treatment with alpha-T was able to increase the glutathione (GSH) antioxidant defense system, while the acute treatment was not. The long-term treatment with alpha-tocopherol (10mg/kg) increased the GSH levels in the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex and increased the glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activity in the hippocampus (10mg/kg) and in the prefrontal cortex (10-100mg/kg). The long-term treatment with fluoxetine (10mg/kg, p.o.), a positive control, was also able to increase the GSH levels in the hippocampus, but failed to alter the activity of both enzymes. Besides the specific antidepressant-like effect, long-term, but not the acute treatment with alpha-T, especially in the doses that produced an antidepressant-like effect (10mg/kg), improved the antioxidant defenses in the mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, two structures closely implicated in the pathophysiology of depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lobato KR ; Cardoso CC ; Binfaré RW ; Budni J ; Wagner CL ; Brocardo PS ; de Souza LF ; Brocardo C ; Flesch S ; Freitas AE ; Dafré AL ; Rodrigues AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2010.02.002 ","Keywords":"Analysis of Variance\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nExploratory Behavior/drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nFluoxetine/pharmacology\r\nGlutathione/analysis\r\nHindlimb Suspension\r\nHippocampus/chemistry/drug effects\r\nImmobility Response, Tonic/*drug effects\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/chemistry/drug effects\r\nSwimming\r\nTime Factors\r\nalpha-Tocopherol/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lobato KR, Cardoso CC, Binfaré RW, Budni J, Wagner CL, Brocardo PS, de Souza LF, Brocardo C, Flesch S, Freitas AE, Dafré AL, and Rodrigues AL (2010) alpha-Tocopherol administration produces an antidepressant-like effect in predictive animal models of depression..

Few studies have examined the relationship between diet and bipolar disorder (BD), although it can be assumed that some of the observations related to people with depression may be related to BD. The authors present an overview of the relationship between diet and bipolar disorder and the use of dietary interventions in the treatment of BD. They also discuss the use of nutrients, including polyunsaturated fatty acids, N-acetylcysteine, vitamin D, folic acid, and zinc, in the treatment of BD. For patients, the supplementation of mood disorders treatment with dietary recommendations, supplementation with selected nutrients, supplementation of micronutrients, may provide - in addition to indirect and direct effect on brain function - the possibility of greater co-participation in the treatment, enhancing the sense of control, coping, which may have a significant effect on the course of BD and the effectiveness of its treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Łojko D ; Stelmach-Mardas M ; Suwalska A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.12740/PP/OnlineFirst/78703 ","Keywords":"*Antioxidants\r\nBipolar Disorder/prevention & control/*therapy\r\n*Diet\r\nHumans\r\nMicronutrients\r\n*Nutritional Requirements\r\nTrace Elements\r\n*Vitamins\r\nbipolar affective disorder\r\ndiet","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Łojko D, Stelmach-Mardas M, and Suwalska A (2018) Is diet important in bipolar disorder?.

Here, we evaluated the effects of neonatal Dex on the propagation of cortical spreading depression (CSD), and tested the action of vitamins C and E against the effect of Dex. Five groups of Wistar rats received, respectively: [1] no treatment (Naïve); [2] Vehicle (V); [3] tapering doses of Dex (Dex; 0.5mg/kg, 0.3mg/kg, and 0.1mg/kg) on postnatal day (PND) 1-3; [4] Dex plus 200mg/kg vitamin C and 100mg/kg vitamin E (DexCE); [5] only vitamins C and E (CE). Vehicle and vitamins were administered on PND 1-6. CSD was recorded after the pups reached maturity (PND 60-70). The Dex-treated group presented with higher CSD velocities (mean values ± SD, in mm/min: 4.14 ± 0.22, n=10) compared with the control groups (Naïve: 3.52 ± 0.13, n=8; V: 3.57 ± 0.18, n=10; CE: 3.51 ± 0.24, n=10; p<0.05 for all). Vitamins C and E antagonized this effect (DexCE group; CSD velocity: 3.43 ± 0.12, n=9). No intergroup difference was observed concerning P-wave amplitude and duration. In all groups, after the cortex underwent CSD, the electrocorticogram (ECoG) amplitude increased approximately 50% compared with the baseline amplitude for the same animal (CSD-induced ECoG potentiation); however, no intergroup difference was observed. Data suggest that coadministration of antioxidant vitamins with Dex may be a helpful therapeutic strategy to reduce brain adverse effects of dexamethasone.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lopes-de-Morais AA ; Mendes-da-Silva RF ; dos-Santos EM ; Guedes RC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.brainres.2014.09.075 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnimals, Newborn\r\nAntioxidants/*pharmacology\r\nCerebral Cortex/*drug effects\r\nCortical Spreading Depression/*drug effects\r\nDepression/*chemically induced/drug therapy\r\nDexamethasone/*toxicity\r\nGlucocorticoids/pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nVitamins/*pharmacology\r\nAntioxidant vitamin\r\nBrain development\r\nDexamethasone\r\nEpilepsy\r\nGlucocorticoid\r\nSpreading depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lopes-de-Morais AA, Mendes-da-Silva RF, dos-Santos EM, and Guedes RC (2014) Neonatal dexamethasone accelerates spreading depression in the rat, and antioxidant vitamins counteract this effect..

This vitamin plays an essential role in synthesis reactions for neurotransmitters and structural elements of neurons, and therefore its deficiency has been associated with the presence of different disorders linked to mental function. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of folic acid supplementation on homocysteine levels and the cognitive and depressive status of a group of patients with eating disorders with low folate intake. SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study was designed as a randomised, prospective clinical trial, which included 24 participants assigned to two treatment groups for six months: supplemented group (SG) (10 mg/day of folic acid [ACFOL]) and a placebo group (PG). Both groups maintained their medical, dietary and psychological treatment. At baseline and end of the intervention, anthropometric, dietary and biochemical parameters (plasma homocysteine [Hcy], serum and red blood cell folate) were recorded. Cognitive and depressive status questionnaires were administered (Stroop Test, Trail Making Test and Beck Depression Inventory). RESULTS: Twenty-two patients completed the study (SG: 12, PG: 10, mean age: 24.2 ± 8.8 years, BMI 18.9 ± 3.5 kg/m2). The SG significantly increased their serum and red blood cell folate levels and lowered Hcy levels (9.4 ± 2.4 μmol/l vs. 7.5 ± 1.7 μmol/l, P < 0.01). The SG also significantly improved most of their test scores for cognitive and depressive status. The PG showed no significant changes in any of the evaluated variables.

However, no published studies have examined the association between dietary intake of vitamin B and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in a general population. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was done on 7387 Iranian adults aged 20-70 years within the population-based cohort study framework. A validated semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (DS-FFQ) was used to ascertained vitamin B intake. Participants completed the Iranian validated version of depression, anxiety, and stress scale questionnaire 21 (DASS 21) to assess their psychological health. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the association between vitamin B intake and psychological disorders. RESULTS: After adjustment for a wide range of confounders, higher intake of biotin was associated with a lower odds of depression (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55-0.91, P-trend=0.008), anxiety (0.71, 0.56-0.89, P-trend=0.003), and stress (0.58, 0.39-0.87, P-trend=0.01). An inverse relationship was found between B(6) and stress risk (0.50, 0.28-0.90, P-trend= 0.01). Moderate intake of thiamin (0.76, 0.61-0.94, P-trend=0.20), niacin (0.78, 0.62-0.97, P-trend=0.41), and pantothenic acid (0.80, 0.65-0.99, P-trend=0.05) were related to lower odds of anxiety. Additionally, moderate folic acid intake was associated with lower odds of depression (0.78, 0.61-0.99, P-trend=0.71). A subgroup analysis based on sex revealed that biotin's dietary intake reduced the risk of depression, anxiety, and stress, but this association was not significant in the male population. LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional nature of the data prevents causal associations. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that a higher intake of dietary B vitamins, especially biotin, was associated with a lower prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. The role of B vitamins requires further investigation in randomized controlled trials.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mahdavifar B ; Hosseinzadeh M ; Salehi-Abargouei A ; Mirzaei M ; Vafa M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2021.03.055 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnxiety/epidemiology\r\nCohort Studies\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/epidemiology\r\nEating\r\nHumans\r\nIran/epidemiology\r\nMale\r\n*Vitamin B Complex\r\nAnxiety\r\nB vitamin\r\nDepression\r\nPsychological disorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mahdavifar B, Hosseinzadeh M, Salehi-Abargouei A, Mirzaei M, and Vafa M (2021) Dietary intake of B vitamins and their association with depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms: A cross-sectional, population-based survey..

Data Sources: Primary literature was accessed through MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts searches through January 2015. Data from published trials were retrieved for analysis using the following search terms: vitamin D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 25(OH)D, postpartum, pregnancy, and depression. Data Extraction: Inclusion criteria were human subjects, English language, vitamin D as the sole micronutrient under study, and measurement of vitamin D level during pregnancy. Studies measuring vitamin D levels after delivery were excluded. Also any antenatal or prepartum depression was excluded. Data Synthesis: Although a variety factors may contribute to the likelihood and severity of PPD, there are 3 published prospective cohort studies specifically evaluating the relationship between vitamin D and PPD. The results are conflicting: 2 of these studies found a significant correlation between patients with low vitamin D level and PPD, but the third found that high vitamin D levels are associated with a greater incidence of PPD. Conclusion: Available evidence suggests a possible correlation between vitamin D levels at midpregnancy and PPD. Women with risk factors for PPD should be educated on this potential association and ways to maintain normal vitamin D levels. Further study is needed to determine the benefit of vitamin D supplementation in preventing PPD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mahmood I ; Owens CT ; Hoover RM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/8755122515579461 ","Keywords":"postpartum depression\r\npregnancy\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mahmood I, Owens CT, and Hoover RM (2015) Association Between Vitamin D Levels During Pregnancy and Postpartum Depression..

Impairments in the monoaminergic transmission, increased glutamatergic excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and deficits in neurotrophic factors are the main hypothesis raised in order to explain the etiological basis of depression. Although the current antidepressant therapy usually alleviates symptoms and prevents recurrence of episodes, the delay in the onset of the therapeutic effect and the refractory or intolerant responses exhibited by a large number of patients are the main drawbacks of the current therapy. For these reasons, several studies have dealt with the investigation of alternative therapeutic approaches or adjunctive strategies which could improve clinical outcomes. One potential adjunctive treatment with conventional antidepressants involves the use of nutraceuticals (a food, a part of a food, a vitamin, a mineral, or a herb that provides health benefits). In this review, we will focus on the main nutrients, phytochemicals and food that have been shown to have beneficial effects against depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Manosso LM ; Moretti M ; Rodrigues AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1039/c3fo60246j ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nDepression/*diet therapy/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDiet\r\nFunctional Food/analysis\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Manosso LM, Moretti M, and Rodrigues AL (2013) Nutritional strategies for dealing with depression..

In addition to these functions, vitamin E is also important for the central nervous system, and its role in the prevention and/or treatment of some neurological diseases has been suggested. In particular, the role of vitamin E in the modulation of major depressive disorder (MDD) is an issue that has emerged in recent studies. Many factors have been implicated in the pathophysiology of this disorder, including inflammation, oxidative, and nitrosative stress. METHODS: This narrative review discusses the involvement of inflammation, oxidative, and nitrosative stress in the pathophysiology of MDD and presents clinical and preclinical studies that correlate vitamin E with this psychiatric disorder. RESULTS: We gathered evidence from clinical studies that demonstrated the relationship between low vitamin E status and MDD symptoms. Vitamin E has been reported to exert a beneficial influence on the oxidative and inflammatory status of individuals, factors that may account for the attenuation of depressive symptoms. Preclinical studies have reinforced the antidepressant-like response of vitamin E, and the mechanisms underlying its effect seem to be related to the modulation of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. CONCLUSION: We suggest that vitamin E has potential to be used as an adjuvant for the management of MDD, but more studies are clearly needed to ascertain the efficacy of vitamin E for alleviating depressive symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Manosso LM ; Camargo A ; Dafre AL ; Rodrigues ALS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/1028415X.2020.1853417 ","Keywords":"Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAntioxidants/pharmacology\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nInflammation/drug therapy\r\nOxidative Stress\r\nVitamin E/therapeutic use\r\nVitamin E\r\nalpha-tocopherol\r\nanti-inflammatory\r\nantidepressant agents\r\nantioxidant\r\ndepression\r\ninflammation\r\noxidative stress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Manosso LM, Camargo A, Dafre AL, and Rodrigues ALS (2022) Vitamin E for the management of major depressive disorder: possible role of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant systems..

Further the influence of NO-sGC-cGMP signaling in the antidepressant like effect of AA in mice was determined. Male swiss albino mice were used in the present study. Mice in the control group received saline and fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was used as the standard antidepressant drug. AA (50, 100 and 150 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to the mice and depression related behavior were determined using tail suspension test (TST) and forced swim test (FST). Further the whole brain nitrite and serotonin levels were also determined. It was observed that the administration of AA (100 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed the depression like behavior in mice in TST and FST. AA (100 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment decreased the level of nitrite and increased the level of serotonin in the brain of mice significantly as compared to control. Further the behavioral and neurochemical effect of AA (50 mg/kg, i.p) was studied in NO modulator [NO donor: L-Arginine (50 mg/kg, i.p); NO-sGC inhibitor: methylene blue (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and cGMP modulator: sildenafil (1 mg/kg, i.p.)] pretreated mice. It was observed that the pretreatment of NO donor and cGMP modulator counteracted the effect conferred by AA (50 mg/kg, i.p). While the pretreatment of NO-sGC inhibitor potentiated the effect conferred by AA (50 mg/kg, i.p). The present study suggested that the AA confer antidepressant like effect in mice and NO-sGC-cGMP signaling pathway influence the antidepressant like effect of AA in mice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Maratha S ; Sharma V ; Walia V ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11064-021-03496-7 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nArginine/metabolism\r\n*Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nCyclic GMP/metabolism\r\nDepression/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\n*Nitric Oxide/metabolism\r\nSignal Transduction\r\nSwimming\r\nAscorbic acid\r\nBehavior\r\nDepression\r\nFluoxetine\r\nMice\r\nSerotonin\r\nnitrite","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Maratha S, Sharma V, and Walia V (2022) Antidepressant Like Effect of Ascorbic Acid in Mice: Possible Involvement of NO-sGC-cGMP Signaling..

Biochemical studies permitted to identify five forms of vitamin D, called D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5, differing in ultrastructural conformation and origin, with vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol) representing the active forms. In the last decades especially, a constantly increasing bulk of data highlighted how vitamin D could regulate several activities and processes. AIMS: The aim of the present paper was to review and comment on the literature on vitamin D, with a focus on its possible role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. DISCUSSION: Available literature indicates that vitamin D regulates a variety of processes in humans and in the central nervous system. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an enhanced pro-inflammatory state, and formation of Aβ oligomers that might contribute to the cognitive decline typical of the elderly age and, perhaps, dementia. More in general, vitamin D is supposed to play a crucial role in neuroinflammation processes that are currently hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of different psychiatric disorders, such as major depression, bipolar disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders and psychosis. CONCLUSION: It is conceivable that vitamin D supplementation might pave the way towards \"natural\" treatments of a broad range of neuropsychiatric disorders, or at least be useful to boost response to psychotropic drugs in resistant cases.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Marazziti D ; Parra E ; Palermo S ; Barberi FM ; Buccianelli B ; Ricciardulli S ; Cappelli A ; Mucci F ; Dell'Osso L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/0929867328666201210104701 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nCholecalciferol\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nHormones\r\nHumans\r\nPsychotropic Drugs\r\n*Vitamin D\r\n*Vitamin D Deficiency\r\nVitamins\r\nVitamin D\r\nautism.\r\nbiochemistry\r\ncentral nervous system\r\nimmune system\r\nmood disorders\r\nneuro-inflammation\r\nobsessive-compulsive disorders\r\nphysiology\r\nspectrum disorders","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Marazziti D, Parra E, Palermo S, Barberi FM, Buccianelli B, Ricciardulli S, Cappelli A, Mucci F, and Dell'Osso L (2021) Vitamin D: A Pleiotropic Hormone with Possible Psychotropic Activities..

Given that L-methylfolate augmentation is rarely included in major clinical practice guidelines, we sought to systematically review evidence for L-methylfolate augmentation in adults with MDD and to examine its efficacy meta-analytically. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed for articles up to December 31, 2020, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. Included studies were published in peer-reviewed, English-language journals and examined L-methylfolate adjunctive therapy in depressive disorders or its effect on antidepressant response. A fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis and risk of bias assessment using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool were conducted. RESULTS: Qualitative assessment of nine articles (N=6,707 patients) suggests that adjunctive L-methylfolate improved antidepressant response. In the meta-analysis of categorical Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 response, (three studies, N=483) adjunctive L-methylfolate was associated with a small effect versus antidepressant monotherapy (relative risk: 1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.08 to 1.46, p=0.004). A meta-analysis of four studies (N=507) using a continuous measure of depressive symptoms showed a similar effect of adjunctive L-methylfolate (standardized mean difference=- 0.38, 95% CI=- 0.59 to-0.17, p=0.0003).

Anxiety, stress and depression are common neuropsychiatric features in diabetic patients. Hyperglycemia leads to increased oxidative stress which in turn diminishes antioxidant defense system. On the other hand oxidative stress is the leading cause of depression and anxiety disorders. Thus, it seems that diabetes could accelerate the trend of psychiatric diseases. In this randomized single-blind study, evaluation of the effects of two antioxidants (vitamin C and vitamin E) was done on Stress, depression and anxiety levels in 45 diabetic patients for six weeks. The patients were randomly divided in three groups of vitamin E (400 IU day(-1)), vitamin C (1000 mg day(-1)) and placebo. DASS-21 (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21-item) questionnaire items were read to each patient and completed by the main investigator of this study before and after six weeks of supplementation. The scores of depression, anxiety and stress were evaluated separately based on the DASS questionnaire. The results showed a significant decrease in anxiety level (p = 0.005) in vitamin C group compared to other groups but there were no significant differences between groups in terms of changes in stress and depression scores. In conclusion, this study suggests that short-term supplementation of vitamin C is safe and beneficial for reducing anxiety levels in diabetic patients through alleviating oxidative damage.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mazloom Z ; Ekramzadeh M ; Hejazi N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3923/pjbs.2013.1597.1600 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnalysis of Variance\r\nAntioxidants/*therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism\r\nAscorbic Acid/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism\r\nDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications/metabolism/psychology\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIran\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOxidative Stress/drug effects\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSingle-Blind Method\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin E/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mazloom Z, Ekramzadeh M, and Hejazi N (2013) Efficacy of supplementary vitamins C and E on anxiety, depression and stress in type 2 diabetic patients: a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial..

Dietary supplementation to manage stress is widespread despite limited supporting evidence. A systematic review of the available literature was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of specific dietary supplements in managing female stress and anxiety. OBJECTIVES: To identify the impact of essential fatty acids (EFAs), B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium and/or zinc, consumed as dietary supplements to the daily diet, on female stress and anxiety levels. INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 18 years and over, who had participated in a study where stress and/or anxiety were assessed. TYPES OF INTERVENTION(S): Dietary supplementation with EFAs, B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium and/or zinc. TYPES OF COMPARATORS: Supplements, either alone or combined, were compared with either no intervention or placebo. TYPES OF STUDIES: Randomized controlled and pseudo-randomized trials were included. OUTCOMES: Stress and anxiety were assessed using self-report or physiological outcome measures. SEARCH STRATEGY: Published and unpublished studies were sought via MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MedNar, National Institute of Mental Health and the International Association for Women's Mental Health. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Methodological quality was evaluated using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted using the standardized data extraction instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA SYNTHESIS: Due to heterogeneity of the included studies, narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in this review. Essential fatty acids were effective in reducing perceived stress and salivary cortisol levels during pregnancy and anxiety in premenstrual women, and anxiety during menopause in the absence of depression, but were ineffective when depression was disregarded. Disregarding the hormonal phase, EFAs were ineffective in reducing stress or anxiety in four groups of women. Combined magnesium and vitamin B6 supplementation reduced premenstrual anxiety but had no effect when used in isolation and did not affect stress in women suffering from dysmenorrhea when combined or used in isolation. Older women experienced anxiety reduction using vitamin B6, but not folate or vitamin B12. High-dose sustained-release vitamin C was effective in reducing anxiety and blood pressure in response to stress. CONCLUSION: The current review suggests that EFAs may be effective in reducing prenatal stress and salivary cortisol and may reduce anxiety during premenstrual syndrome and during menopause in the absence of depression. Magnesium and vitamin B6 may be effective in combination in reducing premenstrual stress, and vitamin B6 alone may reduce anxiety effectively in older women. High-dose sustained-release vitamin C may reduce anxiety and mitigate increased blood pressure in response to stress. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Essential fatty acids may be effective in reducing prenatal stress and salivary cortisol levels, and premenstrual or menopausal anxiety in the absence of depression. Combining magnesium and vitamin B6 may reduce premenstrual anxiety and vitamin B6 may reduce anxiety in older women. High-dose sustained-release vitamin C may reduce anxiety and mitigate increased blood pressure in response to stress. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Investigating supplementation in longer term studies is warranted and should include compliance testing, the use of inert substances as controls and reliable outcome measures.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McCabe D ; Lisy K ; Lockwood C ; Colbeck M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.11124/JBISRIR-2016-002965 ","Keywords":"Ascorbic Acid/*administration & dosage\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Essential/*administration & dosage\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMagnesium/administration & dosage\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nStress, Psychological/*psychology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin B Complex/*administration & dosage\r\nZinc/administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McCabe D, Lisy K, Lockwood C, and Colbeck M (2017) The impact of essential fatty acid, B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium and zinc supplementation on stress levels in women: a systematic review..

Pyridoxine deficiency leads to increased sympathetic outflow and hypertension in rodents, possibly reflecting decreased central production of these neurotransmitters; conversely, supplemental pyridoxine lowers blood pressure in many animal models of hypertension, and there is preliminary evidence for antihypertensive activity in humans as well. Additionally, physiological levels of PLP interact with glucocorticoid receptors to down-regulate their activity. Thus, high-dose pyridoxine, by amplifying tissue levels of PLP, may be expected to have a favorable impact on certain dysphoric mental states, while diminishing sympathetic output and acting peripherally to blunt the physiological impact of corticosteroids. In light of growing evidence that chronic dysphoria, particularly when accompanied by hopelessness or cynicism, has a major negative impact on morbidity and mortality from a wide range of disorders, high intakes of pyridoxine may have the potential to improve prognosis in many individuals. With respect to cardiovascular health, reduction of homocysteine levels should contribute to this benefit. These predictions are consistent with recent epidemiology correlating plasma PLP levels with risk for vascular events and overall survival.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McCarty MF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1054/mehy.1999.0955 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nHumans\r\nPyridoxine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nSerotonin/biosynthesis\r\nStress, Psychological/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nVitamin B 6 Deficiency/complications/drug therapy\r\ngamma-Aminobutyric Acid/biosynthesis","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McCarty MF (2000) High-dose pyridoxine as an 'anti-stress' strategy..

However, the evidence is inconsistent in many aspects. The objectives of this narrative review were to evaluate the state of the evidence, synthesize the knowledge gaps, and formulate recommendations for more enhanced research in this growing area. METHODS: Electronic searches of MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases were carried out from inception till February 2019 to identify relevant English language peer-reviewed articles. Abstracts generated were systematically screened for eligibility. Included articles were grouped under three broad themes: The association between vitamin D and depression, its biological underpinnings, and trials evaluating the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in depression. Relevant data were extracted as per a structured proforma. RESULTS: A total of 61 articles were included in the present review. Overall findings were that there is a relationship between vitamin D and depression, though the directionality of this association remains unclear. The association appears to be driven by the homeostatic, trophic, and immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D. Evidence from supplementation trials suggest a more robust therapeutic effect on subjects with major depression and concurrent vitamin D deficiency. CONCLUSION: Serum vitamin D levels inversely correlate with clinical depression, but the evidence is not strong enough to recommend universal supplementation in depression. Enriching depression treatment trials with subjects having concurrent vitamin D deficiency appears to be a potential step forward in identifying subgroups who may maximally benefit from this approach.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Menon V ; Kar SK ; Suthar N ; Nebhinani N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4103/IJPSYM.IJPSYM_160_19 ","Keywords":"Depression\r\nimmune system\r\ninflammation\r\npsychiatry\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Menon V, Kar SK, Suthar N, and Nebhinani N (2020) Vitamin D and Depression: A Critical Appraisal of the Evidence and Future Directions..

METHODS: Depressive symptomatology was assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). 41% of Hispanics and 22.6% of NHWs had CES-D scores greater than 16, indicating depressive caseness. Dietary intake was calculated from a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) designed for this population. RESULTS: PLP was significantly associated with CES-D score and depressive caseness in the total sample and in non-supplement users. Deficient levels of plasma PLP (plasma PLP < 20 nmol/L) approximately doubled the likelihood of depressive caseness. Total intake (diet + supplement) of vitamin B(6) was not associated with these outcomes. However, dietary vitamin B(6) was significantly associated with CES-D score and depressive caseness.

Since these neurotransmitters influence mood, the aim the present work to evaluate the effect of vitamin B6 on depression and obsessive compulsive behavior when coadministred with clomipramine, fluoxetine, or venlafaxine. Male mice weighing 25-30 g were used. The immobility time and latency to immobility was measured in the forced swimming test as a model of despair and the number of marbles buried (MB) in an open field was used as the model of obsessive compulsive behavior in mice. Vitamin B6 (100 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected to animals for six days and on the last day antidepressants were also administered and the tests took place with 30 min intervals. Immobility was reduced in vitamin B6 + clomipramine (141 ± 15 s) or venlafaxine (116 ± 15 s) but it was not significant comparing with the drugs alone. No beneficial response was seen in co-administration of vitamin B6 with fluoxetine compared to fluoxetine alone. Fluoxetine also increased the latency to first immobility. Vitamin B6 + clomipramine or venlafaxine reduced the MB behaviour by 77 ± 12% and 83 ± 7% respectively, while using them alone was less effective. Fluoxetine was very effective in reducing MB behaviour (95 ± 3.4%) thus using vitamin B6 concomitantly was not useful. Therefore vitamin B6 as a harmless agent could be suggested in depression and particularly in obsessive compulsive disorder as an adjuvant for better drug response.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mesripour A ; Hajhashemi V ; Kuchak A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4103/1735-5362.199046 ","Keywords":"Anxiety\r\nDepression\r\nObsessive compulsive disorder\r\nVitamin B6","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mesripour A, Hajhashemi V, and Kuchak A (2017) Effect of concomitant administration of three different antidepressants with vitamin B6 on depression and obsessive compulsive disorder in mice models..

GC drugs and elevated cortisol level can cause psychiatric disorders including depression. The B-vitamins have numerous benefits on general health as well as mood, and cognition. The aim was evaluating the effect of vitamin B6 following dexamethasone (DEX)-induced depression in mice, to see if it can be proposed as a remedy for psychiatric problems following GC therapy. Methods: Male mice were housed by six. The immobility time was measured, in the forced swimming test as an animal model of despair and sucrose preference was measured in order to test anhedonia (<65% was taken as a criterion for anhedonia). DEX was administered either single dose (15, 60, 250 mcg/kg) or 15 mcg/kg for 7 consecutive days, vitamin B6 (100 mg/kg) was administered for 7 days. Results: DEX dose dependently increased immobility time that denoted animal depression; as it was 177.5 seconds ± 3 following 60 mcg/kg and 188.3 seconds ± 5 following 250 mcg/kg administration (vs. control animals 164 seconds ± 6, P < 0.01). Premedication with vitamin B6 prevented DEX-induced depression and demonstrated antidepressant effect. It also reduced the immobility time following 7days DEX injection (192.5 seconds ± 6) to 100 seconds ± 5.5; sucrose preference escalated from 50%±3 to 87%±4.

The aim was to evaluate vitamin B6 antidepressant effect in comparison with common antidepressants. Method : BCG (0.2 ml/mouse) single dose was intraperitoneally inoculated in male mice. Vitamin B6 (100 mg/kg), fluoxetine, imipramine, or venlafaxine (10 mg/kg each) were intraperitoneally injected for 14 consecutive days following BCG administration. Illness was evaluated following inoculation and depressive-like behaviors were assessed on days 7 and 14. Results: Illness was induced by BCG since mice lost weight and locomotor activity was reduced. Illness was prevented by vitamin B6 similar to antidepressant drugs. Despair was measured by immobility time during the forced swim test and BCG increased it compared to control (193 ± 3s vs 151 ± 7s, P < 0.01) on day 7, and (200 ± 5s vs 147 ± 6s, P < 0.001) on day 14. Vitamin B6, like antidepressants, reduced despair. BCG clearly induced anhedonia evaluated by sucrose preference test (47.5%), and it was soothed by B6 and the antidepressants. Novelty-suppressed feeding test evaluated long term depressive behavior after 14 days. BCG increased the latency to first feeding (222 ± 41s vs control 87 ± 2.6s, P < 0.001) and reduced food consumption per body weight (13 ± 1 mg/g vs control 19 ± 2 mg/g, P < 0.001) while B6 like antidepressants reduced latency and improved food consumption. Conclusion: Vitamin B6 efficiently prevented BCG sickness and depression that was comparable to common antidepressant drugs. Therefore, B6 supplement for preventing depression in high-risk individuals is suggested for further clinical research.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mesripour A ; Golchin S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.18502/ijps.v17i2.8911 ","Keywords":"Anhedonia\r\nAnimal Experimentation\r\nAntidepressive Agents\r\nBCG Vaccine\r\nDepression\r\nVitamin B6","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mesripour A, and Golchin S (2022) Vitamin B6 Antidepressant Effects Are Comparable to Common Antidepressant Drugs in Bacillus-Calmette-Guerin Induced Depression Model in Mice..

Meta-analyses investigating the effect of vitamin D on depression have been inconsistent. This meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of vitamin D in reducing depressive symptoms among adults in randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT). General and clinical populations, and studies of ill individuals with systemic diseases were included. Light therapy, co-supplementation (except calcium) and bipolar disorder were exclusionary. Databases Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL and The Cochrane Library were searched to identify relevant articles in English published before April 2022. Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2) and GRADE were used to appraise studies. Forty-one RCTs (n = 53,235) were included. Analyses based on random-effects models were performed with the Comprehensive Meta-analysis Software. Results for main outcome (n = 53,235) revealed a positive effect of vitamin D on depressive symptoms (Hedges' g = -0.317, 95% CI [-0.405, -0.230], p < 0.001, I(2) = 88.16%; GRADE: very low certainty). RoB assessment was concerning in most studies. Notwithstanding high heterogeneity, vitamin D supplementation ≥ 2,000 IU/day appears to reduce depressive symptoms. Future research should investigate possible benefits of augmenting standard treatments with vitamin D in clinical depression. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020149760.

These trials were inspired by epidemiological evidence suggesting an inverse association of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) and n3-PUFA levels with MDD. Observational associations may emerge from unresolved confounding, shared genetic risk, or direct causal relationships. We explored the nature of these associations exploiting data and statistical tools from genomics. Results from genome-wide association studies on 25-OH-D (N = 79 366), n3-PUFA (N = 24 925), and MDD (135 458 cases, 344 901 controls) were applied to individual-level data (>2000 subjects with measures of genotype, DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition) lifetime MDD diagnoses and circulating 25-OH-D and n3-PUFA) and summary-level data analyses. Shared genetic risk between traits was tested by polygenic risk scores (PRS). Two-sample Mendelian Randomization (2SMR) analyses tested the potential bidirectional causality between traits. In individual-level data analyses, PRS were associated with the phenotype of the same trait (PRS 25-OH-D p = 1.4e - 20, PRS n3-PUFA p = 9.3e - 6, PRS MDD p = 1.4e - 4), but not with the other phenotypes, suggesting a lack of shared genetic effects. In summary-level data analyses, 2SMR analyses provided no evidence of a causal role on MDD of 25-OH-D (p = 0.50) or n3-PUFA (p = 0.16), or for a causal role of MDD on 25-OH-D (p = 0.25) or n3-PUFA (p = 0.66). Applying genomics tools indicated that shared genetic risk or direct causality between 25-OH-D, n3-PUFA, and MDD is unlikely: unresolved confounding may explain the associations reported in observational studies. These findings represent a cautionary tale for testing supplementation of these compounds in preventing or treating MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Milaneschi Y ; Peyrot WJ ; Nivard MG ; Mbarek H ; Boomsma DI ; W J H Penninx B; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41398-019-0554-y ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/*genetics\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nGenome-Wide Association Study\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMultifactorial Inheritance\r\nPharmacogenetics\r\nVitamin D/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Milaneschi Y, Peyrot WJ, Nivard MG, Mbarek H, Boomsma DI, and W J H Penninx B (2019) A role for vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids in major depression?

Folate deficiencies may lead to an increased risk of depression and poorer antidepressant treatment outcomes, as well as an increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. In 1996, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration mandated fortification of grain products with folic acid, which has brought about vast reductions in folate deficiency. However, folate deficiencies may be caused by improper absorption and utilization, often due to genetic polymorphisms. Individuals, therefore, can have insufficient levels or lack needed forms of folate, despite adequate intake.

However, epidemiological evidence for folate intake and postpartum depression is unavailable. This prospective study examined the relationship of dietary consumption of folate and B vitamins during pregnancy with the risk of postpartum depression. METHODS: Study subjects were 865 Japanese women. Dietary data were obtained during pregnancy from a validated self-administered diet history questionnaire. Postpartum depression was defined as present when subjects had an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of 9 or higher between 2 and 9 months postpartum. Adjustment was made for age, gestation, parity, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, family structure, family income, education, changes in diet in the previous 1 month, season when data at baseline were collected, body mass index, time of delivery before the second survey, medical problems in pregnancy, baby's sex, and baby's birth weight. RESULTS: Postpartum depression developed in 121 subjects (14.0%) 2 to 9 months postpartum. There was no measurable association between intake of folate, cobalamin, or pyridoxine and the risk of postpartum depression. Compared with riboflavin intake in the first quartile, only riboflavin consumption in the third quartile was independently related to a decreased risk of postpartum depression (multivariate odds ratio: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.29-0.95, P for trend=0.55). LIMITATIONS: Personal and family psychiatric history, sociocultural factors, and personal and family relations were not controlled for. The possibility of misclassification of dietary information during pregnancy should be considered. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that moderate consumption of riboflavin may be protective against postpartum depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Miyake Y ; Sasaki S ; Tanaka K ; Yokoyama T ; Ohya Y ; Fukushima W ; Saito K ; Ohfuji S ; Kiyohara C ; Hirota Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2006.05.024 ","Keywords":"Cohort Studies\r\nDepression, Postpartum/*etiology\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/*administration & dosage\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nJapan\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Trimester, Third\r\nProspective Studies\r\nRiboflavin/*administration & dosage\r\nRisk Factors\r\nVitamin B 12/*administration & dosage\r\nVitamin B 6/*administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Miyake Y, Sasaki S, Tanaka K, Yokoyama T, Ohya Y, Fukushima W, Saito K, Ohfuji S, Kiyohara C, and Hirota Y (2006) Dietary folate and vitamins B12, B6, and B2 intake and the risk of postpartum depression in Japan: the Osaka Maternal and Child Health Study..

However, the potential effect of increased vitamin D intake on reducing the risk of menstrual irregularities by decreasing psychological anxiety is yet to be fully elucidated. The existence of such a relationship in athletes with high levels of psychological anxiety and adequate dietary intake remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effects of vitamin D intake on psychological anxiety levels and the risk of menstrual irregularities in healthy college-and international-level female athletes. METHODS: Female intercollege-level track and field and international-level rowing athletes (n = 107) aged 15-24 years were included in this study. Their nutritional intake, body mass, body fat, mental anxiety, and menstrual irregularities were investigated. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was used to examine the effects of several parameters on menstrual irregularities. The independent variables introduced into the GLMM were determined based on Akaike's information criterion. RESULTS: The GLMM identified a significant interaction effect of vitamin D intake and state anxiety on menstrual irregularities, with a p-value of 0.049 and an odds ratio of 0.423.

However, the specific limbic structures implied in the antidepressant-like actions of folic acid are un-known. Thus, intra-lateral septal infusions of folic acid (5.0 nmol, P<0.05; 10.0 nmol, P<0.05) or oral administrations of folic acid (50 mg/kg, P<0.05, p.o.; 75.0; mg/kg, P<0.05, p.o.) or systemic administrations of fluoxetine (20.0 mg/kg, P<0.05; 25.0 mg/kg, P<0.05) reduced immobility by increasing swimming behavior in the forced swimming test (FST) of male Wistar rats. Conversely, desipramine (10.0 mg/kg, P<0.05; 15.0 mg/kg, P<0.05) reduced immobility by increasing climbing behavior. Subthreshold doses of folic acid (2.5 nmol/intra-LSN) combined with subthreshold doses of folic acid (25.0 mg/kg, p.o., P<0.05) or with subthreshold doses of fluoxetine (15.0 mg/kg, P<0.05) and they produced antidepressant-like effects which were canceled by ketanserin. In conclusion, intra-lateral septal infusions of folic acid alone or combined with systemic doses of folic acid or fluoxetine reduced immobility in the FST. These antidepressant-like actions, probably, were due to modifications of the serotonergic system since swimming behavior was increased and these effects were canceled by ketanserin.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Molina-Hernández M ; Téllez-Alcántara NP ; Olivera-López JI ; Jaramillo MT ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2011.08.020 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/*psychology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFolic Acid/*administration & dosage\r\nInfusions, Intraventricular\r\nMale\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSeptum of Brain/*drug effects/physiology\r\nSwimming/*psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Molina-Hernández M, Téllez-Alcántara NP, Olivera-López JI, and Jaramillo MT (2012) Intra-lateral septal infusions of folic acid alone or combined with various antidepressant drugs produce antidepressant-like actions in male Wistar rats forced to swim..

The potential impact of comorbidities and medications associated with vitamin B12 derangements were also investigated. In addition, we reviewed the evidence as to whether vitamin B12 therapy is efficacious for cognitive impairment and dementia. METHODS: A systematic literature search identified 43 studies investigating the association of vitamin B12 and cognitive impairment or dementia. Seventeen studies reported on the efficacy of vitamin B12 therapy for these conditions. RESULTS: Vitamin B12 levels in the subclinical low-normal range (<250 ρmol/L) are associated with Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and Parkinson's disease. Vegetarianism and metformin use contribute to depressed vitamin B12 levels and may independently increase the risk for cognitive impairment. Vitamin B12 deficiency (<150 ρmol/L) is associated with cognitive impairment. Vitamin B12 supplements administered orally or parenterally at high dose (1 mg daily) were effective in correcting biochemical deficiency, but improved cognition only in patients with pre-existing vitamin B12 deficiency (serum vitamin B12 levels <150 ρmol/L or serum homocysteine levels >19.9 μmol/L). CONCLUSION: Low serum vitamin B12 levels are associated with neurodegenerative disease and cognitive impairment. There is a small subset of dementias that are reversible with vitamin B12 therapy and this treatment is inexpensive and safe. Vitamin B12 therapy does not improve cognition in patients without pre-existing deficiency. There is a need for large, well-resourced clinical trials to close the gaps in our current understanding of the nature of the associations of vitamin B12 insufficiency and neurodegenerative disease.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Moore E ; Mander A ; Ames D ; Carne R ; Sanders K ; Watters D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S1041610211002511 ","Keywords":"Alzheimer Disease/drug therapy/etiology\r\nCognition Disorders/drug therapy/*etiology\r\nDementia/drug therapy/etiology\r\nHumans\r\nVitamin B 12/therapeutic use\r\nVitamin B 12 Deficiency/*complications/drug therapy\r\nVitamins/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Moore E, Mander A, Ames D, Carne R, Sanders K, and Watters D (2012) Cognitive impairment and vitamin B12: a review..

By 2050, it is estimated that there will be two billion people aged 60 years or over, of which 131 million are projected to be affected by dementia, while depression is predicted to be the second leading cause of disability worldwide by 2020. Preventing or delaying the onset of these disorders should therefore be a public health priority. There is some evidence linking certain dietary patterns, particularly the Mediterranean diet, with a reduced risk of dementia and depression. Specific dietary components have also been investigated in relation to brain health, with emerging evidence supporting protective roles for n-3 PUFA, polyphenols, vitamin D and B-vitamins. At this time, the totality of evidence is strongest in support of a role for folate and the metabolically related B-vitamins (vitamin B12, vitamin B6 and riboflavin) in slowing the progression of cognitive decline and possibly reducing the risk of depression in ageing. Future studies incorporating new technologies, such as MRI and magnetoencephalography, offer much promise in identifying effective nutrition interventions that could reduce the risk of cognitive and mental disorders. This review will explore the ageing brain and the emerging evidence linking diet and specific nutrients with cognitive function and depression in ageing, with the potential to develop strategies that could improve quality of life in our ageing population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Moore K ; Hughes CF ; Ward M ; Hoey L ; McNulty H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S0029665117004177 ","Keywords":"Aging/*physiology\r\nBrain/*drug effects/physiology\r\nCognition/drug effects\r\nCognition Disorders/*prevention & control\r\nDementia/*prevention & control\r\nDepression/*prevention & control\r\n*Diet\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/prevention & control\r\nNutrients/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\n*Nutritional Status\r\nPolyphenols/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nVitamins/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAD Alzheimer's disease\r\nMCI mild cognitive impairment\r\nRCT randomised controlled trial\r\nAgeing\r\nB-vitamins\r\nCognition\r\nDepression\r\nNutrition","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Moore K, Hughes CF, Ward M, Hoey L, and McNulty H (2018) Diet, nutrition and the ageing brain: current evidence and new directions..

Taking into account that experimental chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) induces depressive-like behavior and that ascorbic acid has antidepressant-like effect in animals, the objective of this study was to investigate the influence of ascorbic acid on depressive-like behavior induced by CUS paradigm, serum corticosterone levels and markers of oxidative stress in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice. Animals were submitted to CUS procedure during 14 days. From the 8th to the 14th day mice received ascorbic acid (10 mg/kg) or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, conventional antidepressant, positive control) once a day by oral route. On 15th day behavioral and biochemical parameters were analyzed. CUS exposure caused a depressive-like behavior evidenced by the increased immobility time in the tail suspension test and decreased time in which mice spent grooming in the splash test. Depressive-like behavior induced by CUS was accompanied by a significant increased lipid peroxidation (cerebral cortex and hippocampus), decreased catalase (CAT) (cerebral cortex and hippocampus) and glutathione reductase (GR) (hippocampus) activities and reduced levels of glutathione (cerebral cortex). Repeated ascorbic acid or fluoxetine administration significantly reversed CUS-induced depressive-like behavior and oxidative damage. No alteration was observed in locomotor activity, corticosterone levels and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. These findings indicate a rapid and robust effect of ascorbic acid in reversing behavioral and biochemical alterations induced by CUS in mice, suggesting that this vitamin may be an alternative approach for the management of depressive symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Moretti M ; Colla A ; de Oliveira Balen G; dos Santos DB; Budni J ; de Freitas AE ; Farina M ; Severo Rodrigues AL; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2011.11.009 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology\r\nAntioxidants/pharmacology\r\nAscorbic Acid/*pharmacology\r\nCatalase/metabolism\r\nCerebral Cortex/*metabolism\r\nCorticosterone/metabolism\r\n*Depression/drug therapy/etiology/metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFluoxetine/*pharmacology\r\nGlutathione/metabolism\r\nGlutathione Reductase/metabolism\r\nHippocampus/*metabolism\r\nLipid Peroxidation/drug effects\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nOxidative Stress/*drug effects\r\nStress, Psychological/complications/metabolism\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Moretti M, Colla A, de Oliveira Balen G, dos Santos DB, Budni J, de Freitas AE, Farina M, and Severo Rodrigues AL (2012) Ascorbic acid treatment, similarly to fluoxetine, reverses depressive-like behavior and brain oxidative damage induced by chronic unpredictable stress..

Acute restraint stress caused a depressive-like behavior in the forced swimming test, accompanied by increased lipid peroxidation (cerebral cortex and hippocampus); increased superoxide dismutase (cerebral cortex and hippocampus), glutathione reductase (cerebral cortex), and glutathione peroxidase (cerebral cortex and hippocampus) activities; and elevated expression of Bcl-2 (hippocampus). Oral administration of ascorbic acid (1 mg/kg) or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) 1 h before restraint stress prevented the stress-induced increase on immobility time in the forced swimming test. Moreover, this vitamin reduced lipid peroxidation to control levels and restored the activity of superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase. Ascorbic acid had no effect on the increased level of Bcl-2 induced by stress. Glutathione levels, glycogen synthase kinase-3β phosphorylation, and Bax expression were not altered by stress or ascorbic acid administration. Besides reinforcing the antioxidant potential of ascorbic acid, our results support the notion that oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis and treatment of stress-induced depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Moretti M ; Budni J ; Dos Santos DB; Antunes A ; Daufenbach JF ; Manosso LM ; Farina M ; Rodrigues AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s12031-012-9892-4 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntioxidants/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAscorbic Acid/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nCerebral Cortex/enzymology/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nFemale\r\nGlutathione Peroxidase/genetics/metabolism\r\nGlutathione Reductase/genetics/metabolism\r\nGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism\r\nGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta\r\nHippocampus/enzymology/metabolism\r\nLipid Metabolism/drug effects\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nOxidation-Reduction/drug effects\r\nProto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism\r\nStress, Psychological/*complications\r\nSuperoxide Dismutase/genetics/metabolism\r\nSwimming\r\nTranscription, Genetic/drug effects\r\nVitamins/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nbcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Moretti M, Budni J, Dos Santos DB, Antunes A, Daufenbach JF, Manosso LM, Farina M, and Rodrigues AL (2013) Protective effects of ascorbic acid on behavior and oxidative status of restraint-stressed mice..

We also investigated the synergistic effect of ascorbic acid (0.1 mg/kg, p.o., sub-effective dose in the TST) with lithium chloride (10 mg/kg, p.o., non-selective GSK-3β inhibitor), AR-A014418 (0.01 μg/site, i.c.v., selective GSK-3β inhibitor) or cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP - 0.01 μg/site, i.c.v., HO-1 inducer) in the TST. The antidepressant-like effect of ascorbic acid (1 mg/kg, p.o.) was prevented by the treatment of mice with LY294002, rapamycin or ZnPP. In addition, sub-effective doses of lithium chloride, AR-A014418 or CoPP, combined with a sub-effective dose of ascorbic acid produced a synergistic antidepressant-like effect. We also demonstrated that 1 h after its administration, ascorbic acid increased the phosphorylation of p70S6K and the immunocontent of PSD-95 in the hippocampus of mice. These results indicate that the antidepressant-like effect of ascorbic acid in the TST might be dependent on the activation of PI3K and mTOR, inhibition of GSK-3β as well as induction of HO-1, reinforcing the notion that these are important targets for antidepressant activity and contributing to better elucidate the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant-like effect of ascorbic acid.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Moretti M ; Budni J ; Freitas AE ; Rosa PB ; Rodrigues AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2013.10.014 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nAscorbic Acid/*pharmacology\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDisks Large Homolog 4 Protein\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nEnzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology\r\nExploratory Behavior/drug effects\r\nGene Expression Regulation/drug effects\r\nGuanylate Kinases/metabolism\r\nHindlimb Suspension/methods/psychology\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nImmobility Response, Tonic/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMembrane Proteins/metabolism\r\nMice\r\nSignal Transduction/*drug effects\r\nSirolimus/*metabolism/pharmacology\r\nTOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism\r\nAntidepressant\r\nAscorbic acid\r\nDepression\r\nGSK-3β\r\nHeme-oxygenase\r\nmTOR","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Moretti M, Budni J, Freitas AE, Rosa PB, and Rodrigues AL (2014) Antidepressant-like effect of ascorbic acid is associated with the modulation of mammalian target of rapamycin pathway..

Administration of TNF-α increased the phosphorylation of p38(MAPK) in hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and the treatment with ascorbic acid prevented this effect. Ascorbic acid increased phosphorylation of ERK1 in the hippocampus of saline- and TNF-α-treated animals, however it did not produce alterations in the cerebral cortex. No effects on phosphorylation of ERK2 or JNK were found.

Over the past decade, antioxidant properties of ascorbate have been extensively characterized and now it is known that this compound is highly concentrated in the brain and neuroendocrine tissues. All this information raised the hypothesis that ascorbate may be involved in neurological disorders. Indeed, the biological mechanisms of ascorbate in health and disease and its involvement in homeostasis of the CNS have been the subject of extensive research. In particular, evidence for an association of this vitamin with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder has been provided. Considering that conventional pharmacotherapy for the treatment of these neuropathologies has important limitations, this review aims to explore basic and human studies that implicate ascorbic acid as a potential therapeutic strategy.

These are highly prevalent disabling conditions with high social and economic costs. Furthermore, a significant percentage of affected individuals cannot benefit from clinical intervention, opening space for new treatments. Although the literature data have reported limited and variable results regarding oxidative stress-related endpoints in stress-related disorders, the possible neuroprotective effect of antioxidant compounds, such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C), emerges as a possible therapy strategy for psychiatric diseases. Here, we briefly present background information on biological activity of ascorbic acid, particularly functions related to the CNS homeostasis. Additionaly, we reviewed the available information on the role of ascorbic acid in stress-related diseases, focusing on supplementation and depletion studies. The vitamin C deficiency is widely associated to stress-related diseases. Although the efficacy of this vitamin in anxiety spectrum disorders is less stablished, several studies showed that ascorbic acid supplementation produces antidepressant effect and improves mood. Interestingly, the modulation of monoaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems is postulated as pivotal target for the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of this vitamin. Given that ascorbic acid supplementation produces fast therapeutic response with low toxicity and high tolerance, it can be considered as a putative candidate for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, especially those that are refractory to current treatments. Herein, the literature was reviewed considering the potential use of ascorbic acid as an adjuvant in the treatment of anxiety and depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Moritz B ; Schmitz AE ; Rodrigues ALS ; Dafre AL ; Cunha MP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jnutbio.2020.108459 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntioxidants/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety/*drug therapy\r\nAnxiety Disorders/drug therapy\r\nAscorbic Acid/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nStress, Psychological/drug therapy\r\nAntidepressant\r\nAnxiety\r\nAscorbic acid\r\nChronic stress\r\nDepression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Moritz B, Schmitz AE, Rodrigues ALS, Dafre AL, and Cunha MP (2020) The role of vitamin C in stress-related disorders..

Specifically, low folate status is a suspected risk factor for depression that also results in an increase in circulating levels of the sulfur amino acid homocysteine. Homocysteine has emerged as an independent risk factor for stroke, and recent studies suggest that vascular disease affecting the brain and Alzheimer's disease may result together in senile dementia. The relationship between stroke and AD was at first interpreted as coincidence, given the pathologic distinctions between the two diseases. However, the connection is now hypothesized to reflect some common pathogenic factors involving folate, homocysteine, or both. It remains unclear whether there is a causal relationship between neurological dysfunction in either condition with folate or homocysteine. Nevertheless, since improvement of folate status lowers homocysteine levels, the hypothesis that folate supplementation may lower the risk of several important health consequences of aging, including various forms of neuropsychiatric dysfunction, is worthy of current intensive exploration.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Morris MS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1046/j.1523-5408.2002.t01-1-00006.x ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAging/metabolism\r\nAlzheimer Disease/etiology/*metabolism\r\nCerebrovascular Disorders/etiology/*metabolism\r\nDepression/etiology/*metabolism\r\nFolic Acid/*metabolism\r\nFolic Acid Deficiency/complications/metabolism\r\nHomocysteine/*metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nHyperhomocysteinemia/complications/etiology/metabolism\r\nMental Disorders/etiology/metabolism\r\nNeurodegenerative Diseases/etiology/metabolism\r\nRisk Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Morris MS (2002) Folate, homocysteine, and neurological function..

Folate is an inexpensive, easily tolerated natural augmenting agent, which has been reported to improve medication treatment outcomes in patients with MDD. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review the literature on the clinical utility of folate augmentation for patients with MDD. FOLATE AND DEPRESSION: Patients with depression have consistently been found to have lower levels of serum and red blood cell folate than normal or nondepressed psychiatric patients. Decreased folate levels have been associated with lowered response rates to standard antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Recent studies have shown that augmentation with a folate supplement increases medication response in both treatment-naïve and treatment-resistant depressed patients irrespective of whether there is folate deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed patients with both low and normal folate levels may benefit from augmenting a primary antidepressant medication either initially, at the onset of treatment, or later after some degree of treatment resistance has been recognized.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Morris DW ; Trivedi MH ; Rush AJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1089/acm.2007.0663 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFolic Acid/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nFolic Acid Deficiency/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nHomocysteine/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Morris DW, Trivedi MH, and Rush AJ (2008) Folate and unipolar depression..

Adjustment was made for age, body mass index, work place, marital status, occupational physical activity, leisure-time physical activity, current smoking, current alcohol drinking, and job stress score. RESULTS: The prevalences of depressive symptoms were 36% for men and 37% for women. Folate intake showed a statistically significant, inverse, and linear association with depressive symptoms in men but not in women. The multivariate odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for depressive symptoms for men in the first, second, third, and fourth quartiles of folate intake were 1.00 (reference), 0.78 (0.38-1.63), 0.57 (0.27-1.18), and 0.50 (0.23-1.06), respectively (P for trend = 0.045).

Clinical overlap can compound diagnosis of depression in vitamin D deficient individuals. Citing high costs, the Ministry of Health has restricted routine vitamin D screening and hence is not feasible. OBJECTIVES: The current case series is an attempt to recognise the clinical overlap between depression and vitamin D deficiency in order to avoid unnecessary antidepressant prescriptions and to demonstrate the role of collaborative care in such patients. METHOD: After appropriate ethics approval 62 patients from an outpatient clinic were screened for the diagnosis of treatment resistant depression. Those who had predominant somatic complaints were further screened for organic factors and those with inadequate vitamin D levels were referred to family physicians for supplementation with vitamin D. RESULTS: More than 50% were detected deficient in vitamin D after our evaluation. They showed subjective improvement with vitamin D supplements. No modification of antidepressants was needed. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency should be suspected in depressed patients with prominent somatic symptoms and their treatment resistance should be reconsidered to avoid unnecessary exposure to mood stabilisers.

However, results of epidemiologic studies on this issue have been inconsistent. The objective of this study was to clarify the association between serum folate and homocysteine concentrations and depressive symptoms in Japanese adults. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data for 530 municipal employees (313 men and 217 women), aged 21-67 years, who participated in a health survey at the time of periodic checkup. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios of depressive symptoms (CES-D scale scores of >or=16) with adjustment for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: In total, 113 men (36.1%) and 79 women (36.4%) had depressive symptoms. A higher serum folate was associated with a decreased prevalence of depressive symptoms in men. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of depressive symptoms for the lowest to highest quartiles of serum folate were 1.00 (reference), 0.53 (0.27-1.03), 0.33 (0.16-0.68) and 0.51 (0.25-1.03), respectively (trend P=0.03). Furthermore, the data suggested a positive association between serum homocysteine and depressive symptoms in men (trend P=0.06). In women, neither folate nor homocysteine was associated with depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Low serum folate may be related to an increased prevalence of depressive symptoms in Japanese men.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nanri A ; Mizoue T ; Matsushita Y ; Sasaki S ; Ohta M ; Sato M ; Mishima N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/ejcn.2009.143 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/*blood/*epidemiology\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/*blood\r\nHealth Status\r\nHealth Surveys\r\nHomocysteine/*blood\r\nHumans\r\nJapan/epidemiology\r\nLogistic Models\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMultivariate Analysis\r\n*Nutritional Status\r\nOdds Ratio\r\nPrevalence\r\nSex Factors\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nanri A, Mizoue T, Matsushita Y, Sasaki S, Ohta M, Sato M, and Mishima N (2010) Serum folate and homocysteine and depressive symptoms among Japanese men and women..

However, the association between vitamin B6 intake and depression remains inconclusive, and few studies have examined the relationship between circulating vitamin B6 concentrations and depressive symptoms. Here, we investigated the cross-sectional and prospective associations between serum pyridoxal concentrations and depressive symptoms among Japanese workers. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Participants were 422 municipal employees (aged 21-67 years) who participated in a baseline survey in 2006 for cross-sectional analysis, and 210 subjects without depressive symptoms at baseline (2006) who completed both baseline and follow-up (2009) surveys for prospective analysis.

METHODS: Daily intake of vitamins was measured by a one-day 24 h recall. Multivariate logistic regression, weighted quantile sum (WQS), quantile g-computation (qgcomp), and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) were used. RESULTS: Of 9,848 adults included in the final analysis, 4.38% had depression. In the logistic regression model, daily vitamin B1 and B3 intakes were associated with depression, and significant trends were observed for these vitamin intake tertiles (p < 0.001). The WQS index was significantly associated with depression (OR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.23-0.24). The gqcomp index also found a significant association between a mixture of vitamin B1 and B3 intake and depression (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.44-0.98). Vitamin B1 intake was the most heavily weighed vitamin intake in this model. In BKMR analysis, the overall effects of vitamin B1 and B3 intake mixture were negatively associated with depression. Vitamin B1 and B3 intake showed negative trends and was observed as the most important factor associated with depression. The cutoff levels for B vitamin intake levels related to depression were reported. LIMITATIONS: A 24-hour recall and cross-sectional design were used. CONCLUSIONS: Given the rising prevalence of depressive symptoms in Korea, an increase in daily intake of vitamin B1 and/or B3 through regular diets may help to reduce the risk of depression. Therefore, there is an ongoing need to investigate these associations between B vitamin supplementation and depression, either separately or jointly, in well-characterized cohorts of depression population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nguyen HD ; Oh H ; Kim MS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2021.12.133 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBayes Theorem\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\n*Depression/epidemiology\r\nHumans\r\n*Thiamine\r\nVitamin B 12\r\nVitamins\r\nDepression\r\nMixture of vitamin intakes\r\nVitamin B1\r\nVitamin B3","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nguyen HD, Oh H, and Kim MS (2022) Mixtures modeling identifies vitamin B1 and B3 intakes associated with depression..

Serum cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) levels were analyzed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and mercury (Hg) levels using a mercury analyzer. Daily vitamin intakes were calculated by 24-h dietary recall. The results obtained showed that females are at higher risk of depression than males. A doubling of serum Cd was associated with a 21% increase in depression (AOR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.07-1.37, p = 0.002), whereas twofold increases in daily vitamin B1, B3 and vitamin A intakes reduced the risk of depression by 17% (0.83, 95% CI: 0.73-0.95, p = 0.005), 20% (0.80, 95% CI: 0.70-0.91, p = 0.001), and 8% (0.92, 95% CI: 0.85-0.99, p = 0.020), respectively. Interactions between heavy metals, vitamin intakes, and sex did not influence the risk of depression.

While approved as an adjunct for unipolar major depressive disorder, no studies have been done to assess the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of L-methylfolate for bipolar depression. As a first step, we developed a registry of bipolar patients treated with L-methylfolate to examine tolerability and outcomes. METHODS: Subjects (N=10) received treatment as usual plus daily L-methylfolate 15mg for 6 weeks in this open-label registry. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and manic symptoms with the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Effect size was measured with Cohen's d to provide an estimate of potential efficacy. RESULTS: The pre-treatment mean (SD) MADRS score was 23.4 (4.34); the post-treatment score was 13.9 (8.24). Cohen's d was 1.19. At post-treatment, 6/10 patients had at least 50% MADRS improvement, and 4/10 patients exhibited remission with MADRS≤10. The pre-treatment YMRS score was 3.2 (3.0); the post-treatment score was 2.7 (5.2). Cohen's d was 0.17. LIMITATIONS: This registry was a small open-label clinical trial for a fluctuating disorder. We cannot rule out that our results are due to regression to the mean. A controlled trial is warranted. CONCLUSIONS: This first proof-of-concept open registry suggests that L-methylfolate in combination with treatment as usual has potential to treat bipolar depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nierenberg AA ; Montana R ; Kinrys G ; Deckersbach T ; Dufour S ; Baek JH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2016.09.053 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*diagnosis\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nRegistries\r\nTetrahydrofolates/*administration & dosage\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\n*Bipolar disorder\r\n*Deplin\r\n*Depression\r\n*L-methylfolate","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nierenberg AA, Montana R, Kinrys G, Deckersbach T, Dufour S, and Baek JH (2017) L-Methylfolate For Bipolar I depressive episodes: An open trial proof-of-concept registry..

The major causes are inadequate sun exposure and inadequate intakes of dietary and supplemental vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency defined as a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level less than 20 and 21-29 ng/ml, respectively, have been linked to increased risk for a variety of medical conditions including cancer, heart disease, type II diabetes, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic bone diseases and neurological disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: The skeletal muscle and brain have a vitamin D receptor and the central nervous system has a capacity to activate vitamin D. Low vitamin D status has been linked to poor performance in neurocognitive testing in elderly. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with muscle weakness, depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and a lower motor neuron-induced muscle atrophy. SUMMARY: Correcting vitamin D deficiency and preventing vitamin D deficiency in children and adults should be a high priority for healthcare professionals to reduce risk for a wide variety of neurological disorders. Children and adults should take at least 400 international unit IU and 2000 IU vitamin D/day, respectively, to prevent vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nimitphong H ; Holick MF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/MCO.0b013e3283414c38 ","Keywords":"Autoimmune Diseases/*etiology\r\nBrain/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/*etiology\r\nMultiple Sclerosis/etiology\r\nMuscle, Skeletal/metabolism\r\nMusculoskeletal Diseases/*etiology\r\nReceptors, Calcitriol/metabolism\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/*complications","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nimitphong H, and Holick MF (2011) Vitamin D, neurocognitive functioning and immunocompetence..

The mechanism by which combining magnesium and vitamin B6 leads to reduced stress in these subjects remains to be elucidated. This secondary analysis investigated the impact of magnesium and vitamin B6 supplementation and perceived stress on erythrocyte magnesium levels, as a marker of body magnesium status. This was a secondary analysis from an 8-week randomized controlled trial comparing oral magnesium (300 mg) and magnesium-vitamin B6 (300 mg + 30 mg) supplementation. Stress level and erythrocyte magnesium level at baseline, and change in erythrocyte magnesium and serum vitamin B6 levels at weeks 4 and 8, were analyzed. Overall, 264 subjects were randomized to treatment and had evaluable Depression Anxiety Stress Scale scores (132 in each treatment arm). At baseline, stress scores, and mean serum magnesium, erythrocyte magnesium, and serum vitamin B6 concentrations were similar between arms. Although not significant between groups, a significant increase over time in erythrocyte magnesium levels was observed in the subgroup of subjects with low baseline erythrocyte magnesium levels (<1.6 mmol/L) following treatment with magnesium and magnesium-vitamin B6 (week 4:0.21 mmol/L [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.10 to 0.31], p = 0.0003; and 0.13 mmol/L [95% CI, 0.02 to 0.23], p = 0.0233, respectively). Change from baseline in circulating vitamin B6 levels at weeks 4 and 8 in the magnesium-vitamin B6 supplemented group (314.96 nmol/L [95%CI, 294.61 to 335.31]) was significantly different (p < 0.0001) compared with the magnesium supplemented group (-0.39 nmol/L [95% CI, -20.73 to 19.94]). Magnesium alone and magnesium-vitamin B6 provided statistically significant increases in erythrocyte magnesium in subjects with low magnesium status (<1.6mmol/L). Vitamin B6 supplementation did not further increase magnesium levels.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Noah L ; Pickering G ; Mazur A ; Dubray C ; Hitier S ; Dualé C ; Pouteau E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1684/mrh.2020.0468 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\nMagnesium/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nVitamin B 6/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics\r\nYoung Adult\r\nbiomarkers of magnesium status\r\nmagnesium supplementation\r\nperceived stress\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nvitamin B6 supplementation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Noah L, Pickering G, Mazur A, Dubray C, Hitier S, Dualé C, and Pouteau E (2020) Impact of magnesium supplementation, in combination with vitamin B6, on stress and magnesium status: secondary data from a randomized controlled trial..

We present a previously unreported secondary analysis of the effect of magnesium, with and without vitamin B6, on depression, anxiety, and QoL. Adults with Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-42) stress subscale score >18 were randomised 1:1 to magnesium + vitamin B6 combination (Magne B6(®) ; daily dose 300 and 30 mg, respectively) or magnesium alone (Magnespasmyl(®) ; daily dose 300 mg). Outcomes included changes from baseline in DASS-42 depression and anxiety scores, and QoL (Short Form-36 Health Survey). DASS-42 anxiety and depression scores significantly improved from baseline to week 8 with both treatments, particularly during the first 4 weeks. Improvement in QoL continued over 8 weeks. Participants' perceived capacity for physical activity in daily life showed greater improvement with magnesium + vitamin B6 than magnesium alone (Week 4). In conclusion, magnesium supplementation, with or without vitamin B6, could provide a meaningful clinical benefit in daily life for individuals with stress and low magnesemia.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Noah L ; Dye L ; Bois De Fer B; Mazur A ; Pickering G ; Pouteau E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/smi.3051 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\n*Magnesium/therapeutic use\r\nMental Health\r\n*Quality of Life\r\nVitamin B 6/therapeutic use\r\nanxiety\r\ndepression\r\nmagnesium supplementation\r\nquality of life\r\nstress\r\nvitamin B6 supplementation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Noah L, Dye L, Bois De Fer B, Mazur A, Pickering G, and Pouteau E (2021) Effect of magnesium and vitamin B6 supplementation on mental health and quality of life in stressed healthy adults: Post-hoc analysis of a randomised controlled trial..

The dietary consumption of nutrients was assessed using a brief self-administered diet history questionnaire. The relationships between the moderate-to-severe anxiety/depressive symptoms and the dietary intake of 43 major nutrients were investigated using multivariate logistic regression analyses. After adjusting for age, menopausal status, and the background factors that were significantly related to depressive symptoms, moderate and severe depression was significantly inversely associated with only vitamin B6 (adjusted odds ratio per 10 μg/MJ in vitamin B6 intake = 0.89, 95% confidence interval = 0.80-0.99).

Thiamine deficiency or lack of activity causes neurological manifestations, especially symptoms of depression, intrinsic to multiple sclerosis (MS) and related to its pathogenesis. On this basis, the aim of this study was to determine the possible relationship between the nutritional habits of patients with MS and the presence of depression. Therefore, a cross-sectional and observational descriptive study was conducted. An analysis of dietary habits and vitamin B1 consumption in a Spanish population of 51 MS patients was performed by recording the frequency of food consumption. Results showed a vitamin B1 intake within the established range, mainly provided by the consumption of ultra-processed products such as cold meats or pastries, and a total carbohydrate consumption lower than recommended, which stands out for its high content of simple carbohydrates deriving from processed foods such as dairy desserts, juice, snacks, pastries, chocolate bars, soft drinks and fermented alcohol. In addition, a significant negative correlation between depression and the intake of thiamine and total carbohydrates was observed. These findings could explain the influence of MS patients' eating habits, and consequently vitamin B1 activity, on depression levels.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ortí JER ; Cuerda-Ballester M ; Drehmer E ; Carrera-Juliá S ; Motos-Muñoz M ; Cunha-Pérez C ; Benlloch M ; López-Rodríguez MM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu12092655 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/*diet therapy\r\nDiet\r\nDietary Carbohydrates/administration & dosage\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFast Foods/analysis\r\nFemale\r\nFood Handling\r\nHealth Behavior\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMultiple Sclerosis/*diet therapy\r\nNutritional Status\r\nPilot Projects\r\nSnacks\r\nThiamine/*administration & dosage\r\ndepression\r\nmultiple sclerosis\r\nvitamin B1","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ortí JER, Cuerda-Ballester M, Drehmer E, Carrera-Juliá S, Motos-Muñoz M, Cunha-Pérez C, Benlloch M, and López-Rodríguez MM (2020) Vitamin B1 Intake in Multiple Sclerosis Patients and its Impact on Depression Presence: A Pilot Study..

METHOD: Empirical papers published in recent years were identified using three search engines and online databases - PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane Database. Specific search terms used were 'vitamin D', 'depression' and 'treatment' and articles were selected that examined the association between vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency and depression, vitamin D supplementation and Vitamin D as a treatment for depression. Our review weighted more recent studies (from 2011), although also considered earlier publications. RESULTS: Empirical studies appear to provide increasing evidence for an association between vitamin D insufficiency and depression, and for vitamin D supplementation and augmentation in those with clinical depression who are vitamin D deficient. Methodological limitations associated with many of the studies are detailed. LIMITATIONS: Articles were restricted to those in the English language while publication bias may have weighted studies with positive findings. CONCLUSIONS: There remains a need for empirical studies to move beyond cross-sectional designs to undertake more randomised controlled longitudinal trials so as to clarify the role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of depression and its management, as well as to establish whether currently suggested associations are clinically significant and distinctive.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Parker GB ; Brotchie H ; Graham RK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2016.08.082 ","Keywords":"Cross-Sectional Studies\r\nDatabases, Factual\r\nDepression/drug therapy/*etiology\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nEmpirical Research\r\nHumans\r\nMood Disorders/etiology\r\nSeasons\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin D\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/*complications/drug therapy\r\n*Augmentation\r\n*Depression\r\n*Supplementation\r\n*Treatment\r\n*Vitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Parker GB, Brotchie H, and Graham RK (2017) Vitamin D and depression..

Here, we synthesize previous findings that serotonin regulates executive function, sensory gating, and social behavior and that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and impulsive behavior all share in common defects in these functions. It has remained unclear why supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D improve cognitive function and behavior in these brain disorders. Here, we propose mechanisms by which serotonin synthesis, release, and function in the brain are modulated by vitamin D and the 2 marine omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Brain serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase 2, which is transcriptionally activated by vitamin D hormone. Inadequate levels of vitamin D (∼70% of the population) and omega-3 fatty acids are common, suggesting that brain serotonin synthesis is not optimal. We propose mechanisms by which EPA increases serotonin release from presynaptic neurons by reducing E2 series prostaglandins and DHA influences serotonin receptor action by increasing cell membrane fluidity in postsynaptic neurons. We propose a model whereby insufficient levels of vitamin D, EPA, or DHA, in combination with genetic factors and at key periods during development, would lead to dysfunctional serotonin activation and function and may be one underlying mechanism that contributes to neuropsychiatric disorders and depression. This model suggests that optimizing vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acid intake may help prevent and modulate the severity of brain dysfunction.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Patrick RP ; Ames BN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1096/fj.14-268342 ","Keywords":"Attention Deficit Disorder with \r\n      Hyperactivity/metabolism/physiopathology/prevention & control\r\nBipolar Disorder/metabolism/physiopathology/prevention & control\r\nBrain/drug effects/*metabolism/physiopathology\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/*metabolism/pharmacology\r\nHumans\r\nImpulsive Behavior/drug effects/physiology\r\nSchizophrenia/metabolism/physiopathology/prevention & control\r\nSerotonin/*biosynthesis\r\nVitamin D/administration & dosage/*metabolism/pharmacology\r\nVitamins/administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacology\r\ndocahexaenoic acid\r\neicosapentaenoic acid\r\nmental illness","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Patrick RP, and Ames BN (2015) Vitamin D and the omega-3 fatty acids control serotonin synthesis and action, part 2: relevance for ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and impulsive behavior..

Derivatives of folic acid such as biopterins and the synthesis of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) are known either to be associated with improvement or to have a direct therapeutic effect in depressive disorder. Studies investigating plasma and red cell folic acid levels in depressed patients have used differing assay methodologies which make comparison difficult, although there is substantial evidence of the association between depressive disorder (particularly severe depression) and low folic acid levels. The few studies available suggest folic acid has either antidepressant properties or can act as an augmenting agent for standard antidepressant treatment. A recently discovered genetic variant (5,10 MTHFR) leading to altered folic acid metabolism may explain why some individuals are vulnerable to the effects of folic acid deficiency, despite adequate intake. The links of 5,10 MTHFR to the presence of depressive disorder in the community are being investigated.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Paul RT ; McDonnell AP ; Kelly CB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/hup.614 ","Keywords":"Brain/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/*etiology/metabolism/therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFolic Acid/administration & dosage/analysis/*physiology\r\nHomocysteine/metabolism\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Paul RT, McDonnell AP, and Kelly CB (2004) Folic acid: neurochemistry, metabolism and relationship to depression..

Currently, neurobiological mechanisms of enhanced retention of aversive memories during depression, and, in particular, their relation to neuroinflammation are unclear. As the association between major depressive disorder and inflammation has been recognized for some time, we aimed to address whether neuroinflammatory changes are involved in enhanced learning of adversity in a depressive state. To study this question, we used a recently described mouse model of enhanced contextual conditioning of aversive memories, the modified forced swim model (modFST). In this model, the classic two-day forced swim is followed by an additional delayed session on Day 5, where increased floating behaviour and upregulated glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) are context-dependent. Here, increased time spent floating on Day 5, a parameter of enhanced learning of the adverse context, was accompanied by hypercorticosteronemia, increased gene expression of GSK-3α, GSK-3β, c-Fos, cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and elevated concentrations of protein carbonyl, a marker of oxidative stress, in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. There were significant correlations between cytokine levels and GSK-3β gene expression. Two-week administration of compounds with antidepressant properties, imipramine (7 mg/kg/day) or thiamine (vitamin B1; 200 mg/kg/day) ameliorated most of the modFST-induced changes. Thus, enhanced learning of adverse memories is associated with pro-inflammatory changes that should be considered for optimizing pharmacotherapy of depression associated with enhanced learning of aversive memories.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pavlov D ; Gorlova A ; Bettendorff L ; Kalueff AA ; Umriukhin A ; Proshin A ; Lysko A ; Landgraf R ; Anthony DC ; Strekalova T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.nlm.2020.107227 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/*administration & dosage\r\nBrain/drug effects/*metabolism\r\nDepression/complications/*metabolism/prevention & control\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nEncephalitis/etiology/*metabolism/prevention & control\r\nImipramine/*administration & dosage\r\nInflammation Mediators/metabolism\r\nLearning/*physiology\r\nMale\r\nMemory/*physiology\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nCytokines\r\nEnhanced learning of adverse memories\r\nGlycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)\r\nMajor depression\r\nMice\r\nOxidative stress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pavlov D, Gorlova A, Bettendorff L, Kalueff AA, Umriukhin A, Proshin A, Lysko A, Landgraf R, Anthony DC, and Strekalova T (2020) Enhanced conditioning of adverse memories in the mouse modified swim test is associated with neuroinflammatory changes - Effects that are susceptible to antidepressants..

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that calcium and vitamin D intakes would be positively associated with brain lesion volumes in elderly individuals with and without late-life depression. A cross-sectional study was performed as part of a longitudinal clinical study of late-life depression. Calcium and vitamin D intakes were assessed in 232 elderly subjects (95 with current or prior depression, 137 without depression) using a Block 1998 food frequency questionnaire. Calcium, vitamin D, and kilojoule intake were determined. Brain lesion volumes were calculated from magnetic resonance imaging scan. Subjects were 60 years or older. Calcium and vitamin D intakes were significantly and positively correlated with brain lesion volume (P < .05 and P < .001, respectively). In 2 separate multivariable models, controlling for age, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, group (depression/comparison), lesion load (high/low), and total kilocalories, these positive associations remained significant (P < .05 for calcium; P < .001 for vitamin D). In conclusion, calcium and vitamin D consumption were associated with brain lesions in elderly subjects even after controlling for potentially explanatory variables. These associations may be due to vascular calcification or other mechanism. The possibility of adverse effects of high intakes of calcium and vitamin D needs to be further explored in longitudinal studies of elderly subjects.","Comments":"钙和维生素 D 的消耗仍然与老年受试者的脑损伤有关。这些关联可能是由于血管钙化或其他机制。在对老年受试者的纵向研究中，需要进一步探讨高钙和维生素 D 摄入量产生不良影响的可能性。","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Payne ME ; Anderson JJ ; Steffens DC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.nutres.2008.02.013 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nBone Density Conservation Agents/*adverse effects\r\nBrain/*pathology\r\nBrain Diseases/chemically induced/complications/*pathology\r\nCalcium Metabolism Disorders/pathology\r\nCalcium, Dietary/*adverse effects\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepressive Disorder/complications/*pathology\r\nDiabetes Complications/pathology\r\nDiet Surveys\r\nDietary Supplements/adverse effects\r\nFemale\r\nHeart Diseases/complications/pathology\r\nHumans\r\nHypertension/complications/pathology\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\r\nMale\r\nMultivariate Analysis\r\nRegression Analysis\r\nVitamin D/*adverse effects\r\nVitamins/*adverse effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Payne ME, Anderson JJ, and Steffens DC (2008) Calcium and vitamin D intakes may be positively associated with brain lesions in depressed and nondepressed elders..

The main outcomes included (1) depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression, CES-D, and Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), (2) anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety), and (3) health status (Short Form, SF-12). RESULTS: Forty-six women (92%) completed all visits. There was a significant decrease in depression (CES-D and PHQ-9, p < 0.001) and anxiety (state and trait, p < 0.001). An improvement in mental health status (SF-12, p < 0.001) was also found. After controlling for covariates (race, season of enrollment, baseline vitamin D, baseline depression (PHQ-9), and body mass index), the decline in depression remained significant (CES-D, p < 0.001).

METHODS: In this double-blind randomized active comparator-controlled trial, women with significant depressive symptoms as assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale received weekly oral vitamin D(3) supplementation (50,000 IU) or an active comparator (5,000 IU) for 6 months. Assessments of vitamin D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D], and depression were measured at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 129 women were randomized, from which 119 completed the study (57 in lower dose and 62 in higher dose). Participants had an average 25 (OH) D and HbA1c of 20.8 ng/mL and 7.8%, respectively, at baseline. They were diverse (48% Black) and had a mean age of 50 and T2D for about 8 years. Upon completion of vitamin D(3) supplementation, serum 25 (OH) D levels increased with 50,000 IU (+34 ng/mL) and 5,000 IU (+10 ng/mL). There was no difference in CES-D scores by treatment dose. Overall, depressive symptoms significantly improved over time with an average CES-D decline of 12.98 points (95% CI: -15.04 to -10.93; p < 0.001). Among women with moderate baseline depressive symptoms, those receiving the lower dose had nominally lower depression scores at follow-up than those in the higher dose cohort.

CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in the dosing effect of vitamin D(3) supplementation for the treatment of depressive symptoms in women with T2D who present with significant symptoms and low vitamin D. Regardless of the dose, participants' mood improved over time. Further study of vitamin D to target depressive symptoms in comorbid populations is needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Penckofer S ; Ridosh M ; Adams W ; Grzesiak M ; Woo J ; Byrn M ; Kouba J ; Sheean P ; Kordish C ; Durazo-Arvizu R ; Wallis D ; Emanuele MA ; Halaris A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1155/2022/4090807 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*psychology\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nVitamin D/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Penckofer S, Ridosh M, Adams W, Grzesiak M, Woo J, Byrn M, Kouba J, Sheean P, Kordish C, Durazo-Arvizu R, Wallis D, Emanuele MA, and Halaris A (2022) Vitamin D Supplementation for the Treatment of Depressive Symptoms in Women with Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Clinical Trial..

This paper aims to systematically review the evidence base for the neuropsychiatric effects of vitamin C deficiency. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified via systematic literature review. RESULTS: Nine studies of vitamin C deficiency, including subjects both with and without the associated physical manifestations of scurvy, were included in this review. Vitamin C deficiency, including scurvy, has been linked to depression and cognitive impairment. No effect on affective or non-affective psychosis was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Disparate measurement techniques for vitamin C, and differing definitions of vitamin C deficiency were apparent, complicating comparisons between studies. However, there is evidence suggesting that vitamin C deficiency is related to adverse mood and cognitive effects. The vitamin C blood levels associated with depression and cognitive impairment are higher than those implicated in clinical manifestations of scurvy. While laboratory testing for ascorbic acid can be practically difficult, these findings nonetheless suggest that mental health clinicians should be alerted to the possibility of vitamin C deficiency in patients with depression or cognitive impairment. Vitamin C replacement is inexpensive and easy to deliver, although as of yet there are no outcome studies investigating the neuropsychiatric impact of vitamin C replacement in those who are deficient.","Comments":"倾向性的专家意见，列为低质量证据","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Plevin D ; Galletly C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12888-020-02730-w ","Keywords":"Ascorbic Acid/blood\r\nAscorbic Acid Deficiency/blood/*complications/physiopathology/*psychology\r\nCognitive Dysfunction/blood/*etiology/physiopathology/psychology\r\nDepression/blood/complications/physiopathology/psychology\r\nHumans\r\nScurvy/blood/complications\r\nVitamins/blood\r\nCognition\r\nDepression\r\nNeuropsychiatry\r\nScurvy\r\nVitamin C deficiency","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Plevin D, and Galletly C (2020) The neuropsychiatric effects of vitamin C deficiency: a systematic review..

We also determined the relationship between nutrients intake with depres¬sion severity. METHODS: Seventy major depressive patients were selected randomly from outpatient depressive subjects, referred to Razi Psychiatry Hospital in Tabriz, Iran in 2007. Dietary intakes were rec¬orded and compared with dietary reference intakes (DRIs). Definition of the disease and its se¬verity were according to DSM-IV-TR and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, respectively. Nu¬tritionist III program, Chi-square, correlation and t-test were used for data analyses. Demo¬graphic, clinical and laboratory data were analyzed using SPSS software for windows (ver¬sion13.0). RESULTS: According to dietary analysis, 11.4% and 55% of patients had dietary protein and energy deficiency, respectively. 97.1% and 95.7% of patients had less folate and B12 intakes than recom¬mended dietary allowances. The mean (Mean ± SD) for plasma folate and B12 was 5.18±6.11 ng/ml and 389.05±346.9 pg/ml, respectively. Low plasma folate and B12 was observed in 51.4% and 50.0 % of patients, respectively. There was no significant relationship between blood folate and B12 levels with depression severity. Similarly, nutrients intake had no effect on depression se¬verity. CONCLUSION: Low plasma concentrations and low dietary intakes of folate and B12 are common among Tabrizian depressive patients. It seems that nutritional intervention for increasing folate and vitamin B12 intake must be considered as health promotive and preventative program for patients suffering from depression disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pourghassem Gargari B; Saboktakin M ; Mahboob S ; Pourafkari N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.5681/hpp.2012.017 ","Keywords":"Folate\r\nIran\r\nMajor depression\r\nNutritional status\r\nVitamin B12","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pourghassem Gargari B, Saboktakin M, Mahboob S, and Pourafkari N (2012) Nutritional status in patients with major depressive disorders: a pilot study in tabriz, iran..

After six-weeks of washout, the intervention groups followed the diets in reverse order. Data was collected once more at the end of the eight-week intervention period. No significant changes in mood were observed in the analyses with both genders combined and in females. However, we have observed a significant medium effect size improvement in the Total Mood Disturbance score (-27.49%, p = 0.043, Cohen's d = 0.708) in males.

Use of OCs has been associated with decreased B6 levels. In 1 study, 80% of users had a relative B6 deficiency and 20% an absolute deficiency. Depression, a known complaint of OC users, is a symptom of B6 deficiency. Since users experience depression at a rate of 6.6%, research has been performed on the link between OC use, B6 deficiency, and depression. 2 studies are discussed: one in which 58 women complaining of premenstrual depression while on OCs were given supplements of B6; 31% experienced complete relief and a further 44% improvement of symptoms. In another double-blind study of 22 depressed women using OCs, placebo and B6 were administered in a cross-over fashion to 11 of these women who had absolute deficiency; they were given 20 mg of B6 or a placebo. All 5 of the 11 B6 deficient women given 20-mg of B6 improved according to clinical scores. Other symptoms of vitamin B6 deficiency include hyperirritability, convulsions, loss of appetite, loss of weight, general weakness, lassitude, confusion, and a hypochromic, microcytic anemia with a high serum iron level. There is agreement that vitamin B6 deficiency should be treated with additional vitamin intake and possibly OC discontinuation. B6 is an essential component of the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate, required for activating several body enzymes, and OCs apparently interfere with 5-hydroxtryptamine formation through interference with its decarboxylase. Depression in OC-using women is then thought to be due to low levels of brain serotonin (5-hydroxtryptamine).","Comments":"PIP: TJ: CONTRACEPTIVE TECHNOLOGY UPDATE","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Prothro J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Biology\r\n*Central Nervous System\r\nContraception\r\n*Contraceptives, Oral\r\n*Depression\r\nDisease\r\nFamily Planning Services\r\nMental Disorders\r\nPhysiology\r\nSerotonin\r\n*Vitamin B Complex\r\nVitamins\r\nBiology\r\nCentral Nervous System\r\n*Central Nervous System Effects\r\nContraception\r\nContraceptive Methods--side effects\r\n*Depression\r\nDiseases\r\nFamily Planning\r\nMental Disorders\r\n*Oral Contraceptives--side effects\r\nPhysiology\r\nSerotonin\r\n*Vitamin B Complex\r\nVitamins","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Prothro J (1981) Any depression from OC-altered vitamin B6 levels?

One hundred and thirty-nine male students aged 18 to 35 years were recruited from local tertiary institutes in Christchurch, New Zealand. The average plasma vitamin C concentration was 58.2 ± 18.6 (SD) µmol/L and the average total mood disturbance score was 25.5 ± 26.6 (possible score -32 to 200 measuring low to high mood disturbance, respectively). Plasma vitamin C concentration was inversely correlated with total mood disturbance as assessed by POMS (r = -0.181, p < 0.05).

The purpose of this study was to assess safety and describe patient experience using l-methylfolate calcium in a real-world pediatric and adolescent population. A retrospective chart review of patients (7 to 20 y of age, mean age 16 y) prescribed l-methylfolate calcium at a psychiatry clinic in Amherst, NY, between January 1, 2010 and November 10, 2015 was conducted. Patients to whom l-methylfolate calcium 15 mg/d (n=139) or 7.5 mg/d (n=7) was administered were identified; 44 patients who were prescribed but to whom l-methylfolate calcium was not administered were included as a comparator population. Common neuropsychiatric diagnoses included anxiety disorders (68% in the treatment population vs. 50% in the comparator population) and mood disorders (57% in the treatment population vs. 52% in the comparator population). Antidepressants (69% vs. 55%) and mood stabilizers or antiepileptic drugs (63% vs. 57%) were frequently prescribed in combination with l-methylfolate calcium. Adverse events occurred less frequently in the treated population, possibly due to the addition of l-methylfolate calcium (10% vs. 25%, P=0.02). The most common adverse events in the treated population were impaired sleep (5 patients) and increased anxiety (3 patients). Rates of laboratory abnormalities did not differ significantly between the treated and comparator populations (P=0.13). Positive subjective treatment experiences were reported by 22.5% of treated patients and negative subjective treatment experiences were reported by 5.4% of treated patients. L-methylfolate calcium was well-tolerated in a pediatric/adolescent population and may provide benefits for patients with a range of neuropsychiatric conditions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rainka M ; Aladeen T ; Westphal E ; Meaney J ; Gengo F ; Greger J ; Capote H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/PRA.0000000000000400 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAnticonvulsants/administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety Disorders/drug therapy\r\nChild\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMental Disorders/drug therapy\r\nMood Disorders/drug therapy\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nTetrahydrofolates/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rainka M, Aladeen T, Westphal E, Meaney J, Gengo F, Greger J, and Capote H (2019) L-Methylfolate Calcium Supplementation in Adolescents and Children: A Retrospective Analysis..

The present study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of omega-3 and vitamin D co-supplementation on psychological distresses in women of reproductive age with pre-diabetes and hypovitaminosis D. METHODS: The present factorial clinical trial was conducted on 168 women of reproductive age with pre-diabetes and hypovitaminosis D. These participants were selected by stratified random sampling and were assigned to four groups for 8 weeks: group 1 (placebo group), group 2 (omega-3 group), group 3 (vitamin D group), and group 4 (co-supplement group). The medication and placebo doses being two 1000-mg tablets each day for omega-3 and 50,000-IU pearls every 2 weeks for vitamin D. Fasting blood glucose and vitamin D were measured at the beginning of the study. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were completed by the participants at the start and end of the intervention. RESULTS: A significant difference was observed in terms of reduction in anxiety and improvement in sleep quality in the co-supplementation compared to the other three groups (p < .05). There was also a significant difference between the group receiving both supplements and the group receiving only placebos in terms of reduction in depression and stress (p < .05). CONCLUSION: Vitamin D and omega-3 co-supplementation improved depression, anxiety, and sleep quality in women of reproductive age with pre-diabetes and hypovitaminosis D. Therefore, these two supplements can be recommended for improving the mental health of this group of women. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials Code: IRCT20100130003226N17.

Women who are depressed during pregnancy are at a higher risk for preterm delivery, preeclampsia, birth difficulties, and postpartum depression. The treatment of depression in conventional medicine has focused on physiological factors that lead to impaired neurotransmitter function and treatments to improve neurotransmitter function. Pharmaceutical substances pose risks for pregnant and lactating women, and lower risk options are preferred. Micronutrients, including certain B vitamins, folate, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), play a role in the synthesis and absorption of neurotransmitters. Experimental studies suggest that supplementation with specific micronutrients may alleviate depressive symptoms and improve birth outcomes in patients with perinatal depression. Alternative treatments for depression, including nutritional supplements, are an important treatment option for depressive symptoms while limiting potential side effects and treatment costs. This article explores the biological basis of perinatal depression and reviews the potential benefits of non-pharmacological interventions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rechenberg K ; Humphries D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Brain/physiopathology\r\nDepression/*diet therapy/drug therapy\r\nDepression, Postpartum/*diet therapy/drug therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHomocysteine/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\n*Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nPregnancy\r\ndepression\r\nnutrition\r\nperinatal depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rechenberg K, and Humphries D (2013) Nutritional interventions in depression and perinatal depression..

METHODS: Early stress was induced through maternal deprivation (MD), while late life stress was induced using the chronic mild stress (CMS) protocol. Young rats which were subjected to MD and the adult rats which were subjected to CMS were treated with omega-3 fatty acids (0.72 g/kg), NAC (20 mg/kg) or folic acid (50 mg/kg) once/day, for a period of 20 days. Then, the animals' immobility times were evaluated using the forced swimming test. Oxidative stress parameters were evaluated in the brain. RESULTS: Depressive-like behavior induced by CMS was prevented by NAC and folic acid, and depressive-like behavior induced by MD was prevented by NAC, folic acid and omega-3. NAC, folic acid and omega-3 were able to exert antioxidant effects in the brain of rats subjected to CMS or MD. These preventive treatments decreased the levels of protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation, and also decreased the concentrations of nitrite/nitrate and reduced the activity of myeloperoxidase activity in the rat brain which was induced by CMS or MD. NAC, folic acid and omega-3 increased superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in the rat brain subjected to early or late life stress. CONCLUSIONS: NAC, omega-3 and folic acid may present interesting lines of treatment based on their antioxidant properties, which cause an inhibition of behavioral and brain changes that occur from stressful life events.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Réus GZ ; Maciel AL ; Abelaira HM ; de Moura AB ; de Souza TG ; Dos Santos TR; Darabas AC ; Parzianello M ; Matos D ; Abatti M ; Vieira AC ; Fucillini V ; Michels M ; Dal-Pizzol F ; Quevedo J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.nut.2018.03.006 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology\r\nAntioxidants/pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nBrain/*drug effects\r\nDepressive Disorder/*prevention & control\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*pharmacology\r\nFolic Acid/*pharmacology\r\nLipid Peroxidation/drug effects\r\nMaternal Deprivation\r\nOxidative Stress/*drug effects\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nStress, Psychological/complications\r\nAnimal model of depression\r\nAntidepressant\r\nFolic acid\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nOxidative stress\r\nω-3","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Réus GZ, Maciel AL, Abelaira HM, de Moura AB, de Souza TG, Dos Santos TR, Darabas AC, Parzianello M, Matos D, Abatti M, Vieira AC, Fucillini V, Michels M, Dal-Pizzol F, and Quevedo J (2018) ω-3 and folic acid act against depressive-like behavior and oxidative damage in the brain of rats subjected to early- or late-life stress..

We examined physiological and clinical effects of l-methylfolate, the fully reduced and bioactive form of folate, in schizophrenia. In this randomized, double-blind trial, outpatients with schizophrenia (n=55) received l-methylfolate 15 mg or placebo for 12 weeks. Patients were maintained on stable doses of antipsychotic medications. The pre-defined primary outcome was change in plasma methylfolate at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included change in symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms, Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia), cognition (Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia composite) and three complementary magnetic resonance imaging measures (working memory-related activation, resting connectivity, cortical thickness). Primary, mixed model, intent-to-treat analyses covaried for six genetic variants in the folate pathway previously associated with symptom severity and/or response to folate supplementation. Analyses were repeated without covariates to evaluate dependence on genotype. Compared with placebo, l-methylfolate increased plasma methylfolate levels (d=1.00, P=0.0009) and improved PANSS Total (d=0.61, P=0.03) as well as PANSS Negative and General Psychopathology subscales. Although PANSS Total and General Psychopathology changes were influenced by genotype, significant PANSS Negative changes occurred regardless of genotype. No treatment differences were seen in other symptom rating scales or cognitive composite scores. Patients receiving l-methylfolate exhibited convergent changes in ventromedial prefrontal physiology, including increased task-induced deactivation, altered limbic connectivity and increased cortical thickness.

On the 22nd day, animals were submitted to tail suspension test, open-field test and splash test. Corticosterone treatment caused a depressive-like behavior, evidenced by increased immobility time in the tail suspension test and decreased time in which mice spent grooming in the splash test. Repeated folic acid or fluoxetine administration significantly abolished corticosterone-induced depressive-like behavior. Chronic administration of corticosterone decreased levels of serum corticosterone in mice. Neither folic acid, nor fluoxetine treatment reversed this impairment. These findings indicate a robust effect of folic acid in reversing behavioral alterations induced by corticosterone model of depression in mice, suggesting that this vitamin may be an alternative approach for the management of depressive symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rosa PB ; Ribeiro CM ; Bettio LE ; Colla A ; Lieberknecht V ; Moretti M ; Rodrigues AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pbb.2014.10.003 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nCorticosterone/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects\r\nDepression/*chemically induced/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/*therapeutic use\r\nImmobilization/psychology\r\nMice\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nAntidepressant\r\nCorticosterone\r\nDepression\r\nFolic acid\r\nStress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rosa PB, Ribeiro CM, Bettio LE, Colla A, Lieberknecht V, Moretti M, and Rodrigues AL (2014) Folic acid prevents depressive-like behavior induced by chronic corticosterone treatment in mice..

Considering that recent evidence has suggested that ascorbic acid may exert an antidepressant-like effect through mechanisms similar to ketamine, this study evaluated the involvement of GABAA and GABAB receptors in the antidepressant-like effect of ascorbic acid, comparing the results with those obtained with ketamine. METHODS: To investigate the involvement of GABAA in the antidepressant-like effect of ascorbic acid and ketamine in the tail suspension test (TST), mice were treated with a sub-effective dose of ascorbic acid (0.1mg/kg, po), ketamine (0.1mg/kg, ip) or vehicle and 30minutes later, a sub-effective dose of muscimol (0.1mg/kg, ip, GABAA receptor agonist) or vehicle was administered. In another set of experiments, mice were treated with ascorbic acid (1mg/kg, po, active dose in the TST) or vehicle and 30minutes later, baclofen (1mg/kg, ip, GABAB receptor agonist) was administered. A similar experimental protocol was performed with ketamine (1mg/kg, ip). RESULTS: The administration of muscimol combined with ascorbic acid or ketamine produced a synergistic antidepressant-like effect in the TST. Moreover, the antidepressant-like effects of ascorbic acid and ketamine were abolished by baclofen. There was no alteration in spontaneous locomotion in any experimental group. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the anti-immobility effect of ascorbic acid and ketamine in TST may involve an activation of GABAA receptors and a possible inhibition of GABAB receptors.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rosa PB ; Neis VB ; Ribeiro CM ; Moretti M ; Rodrigues AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pharep.2016.05.010 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nAscorbic Acid/*pharmacology\r\nDepression/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFemale\r\nHindlimb Suspension/methods\r\nKetamine/*pharmacology\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nReceptors, GABA-A/*metabolism\r\nSynaptic Transmission/drug effects\r\ngamma-Aminobutyric Acid/*metabolism\r\nAscorbic acid\r\nDepression\r\nGABA\r\nKetamine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rosa PB, Neis VB, Ribeiro CM, Moretti M, and Rodrigues AL (2016) Antidepressant-like effects of ascorbic acid and ketamine involve modulation of GABAA and GABAB receptors..

Diet, stress, medication, genetics, and the microbiome have been attributed to playing a role. Currently, prescription drugs are the first course of treatment despite the World Health Organization calling for a need to develop lifestyle interventions to manage these disorders. The use of single amino acids to impact selected neurotransmitters has demonstrated positive outcomes in the literature, however, the use of multiple amino acids, alongside personalized nutritional therapies is not well documented for mood disorders. This case report demonstrates the effective use of amino acids as an innovative therapy for the management of mood disorders. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 26-year-old Caucasian female presented with anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, carbohydrate cravings, and low energy. She had been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), bipolar depression II and generalized anxiety. The patient was under the care of a counselor and physician and was prescribed Lamictal (200 mg/day). With only moderate success with other therapies, the patient sought nutritional counseling. A personalized nutrition intervention was created to include targeted amino acid therapy (tryptophan, glycine, L-glutamine, D-phenylalanine, L-theanine, and L-tyrosine), select nutrients (multi vitamin/mineral, zinc, vitamin C, GLA and magnesium) and a low-glycemic diet to be followed for 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: This case report demonstrated the use of targeted micronutrient and amino acid therapy, along with a low glycemic diet, resulted in marked improvement in all mood disorder symptoms this patient experienced. It also highlights that a comprehensive integrative approach may be a beneficial option for individuals with mood disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ross K ; VanNortwick M ; Dragone D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.explore.2020.03.011 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnxiety Disorders/drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\n*Mood Disorders/drug therapy\r\nQuality of Life\r\n*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic\r\nTherapies, Investigational\r\nAmino acid therapy\r\nAnxiety\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nCase report\r\nMood disorder\r\nNutrition\r\nSupplements","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ross K, VanNortwick M, and Dragone D (2021) Innovative therapies for mood disorders: A case report..

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of FA + AP for schizophrenia. METHODS: The primary outcome was an improvement in total symptoms. Other outcomes were psychopathology subscales (positive, negative, general, and depressive symptoms), discontinuation due to all-cause and adverse events, and individual adverse events. The meta-analysis evaluated the effect size based on a random-effects model. RESULTS: Although we included ten RCTs with 925 patients in total (seven folic acid RCTs (n = 789), two methylfolate RCTs (n = 96), and one folinic acid RCT (n = 40)) in the systematic review, only seven RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled FA + AP treatments were not superior to placebo + AP in the improvement of total (N = 7, n = 340; standardized mean difference (SMD) = - 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) = - 0.41, 0.02, p = 0.08, I(2) = 0%), positive, general, or depressive symptoms. Pooled FA + AP treatments were more effective than placebo + AP for negative symptoms (N = 5, n = 281; SMD = -0.25, 95% CI = -0.49, -0.01, p = 0.04, I(2) = 0%).

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that pooled FA + AP treatment improves negative symptoms in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, this treatment was well tolerated. However, because our results might exhibit a small-study effect, future studies with a larger sample should be conducted to obtain more robust results.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sakuma K ; Matsunaga S ; Nomura I ; Okuya M ; Kishi T ; Iwata N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00213-018-4926-4 ","Keywords":"Antipsychotic Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/epidemiology/psychology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFolic Acid/*administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nPsychopathology\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic/methods\r\nSchizophrenia/*drug therapy/epidemiology\r\n*Schizophrenic Psychology\r\nTetrahydrofolates/*administration & dosage\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nFolic acid\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nMethylfolate\r\nNegative symptoms\r\nSchizophrenia\r\nSystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sakuma K, Matsunaga S, Nomura I, Okuya M, Kishi T, and Iwata N (2018) Folic acid/methylfolate for the treatment of psychopathology in schizophrenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis..

The nutritional etiology of the depression proposes that vitamin D may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of depression. Further, vitamin D deficiency has been found to aggravate depression in animals. Therefore, vitamin D treatment might be a potential therapeutic aid in depression management. This study aimed to explore the antidepressant effects of vitamin D in a Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-induced depression model. METHODS: Thirty-six mice were randomly assigned to short-term and long-term experimental groups. In each group, mice were randomly subcategorized into three subgroups: 1. control (received vehicle), 2. BCG (received BCG [10(7) CFU/mouse]), and 3. BCG + vitamin D (received vitamin D [60.000 IU/kg] before BCG [10(7) CFU/mouse] inoculation). After completion of the two experimental periods (3 days for the short-term group and 2 weeks for the long-term group), the mice underwent three behavioral tests: locomotor activity, the forced swimming test (FST), and the tail suspension test (TST). RESULTS: Locomotor activity did not significantly differ among the subgroups in either the long-term or short-term groups. In the short-term group, the total immobility time on the FST was decreased in the vitamin D-treated group compared to the BCG group. However, in the TST, no significant difference was found between the vitamin D-treated group and the BCG group. In the long-term group, the immobility time on the FST was decreased in the vitamin D-treated group compared to the BCG group. Similarly, the total immobility time on the TST was also significantly lower in the vitamin D-treated mice than in the BCG-treated mice. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D is useful in the management of depressive behavior. The potential role of vitamin D in the etiology of depression should be investigated in future work.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Saleh LA ; Almutairi FM ; Alorabi WK ; Alkuhayli BA ; Alzaidi SS ; Alzahrani SB ; Aljumayi FA ; Abduljabbar MH ; Alharthi AS ; Alsufyani MA ; Alhazmi MH ; Althobaiti AA ; Almutairi FN ; Alshehri FS ; Altowairqi E ; Althobaiti YS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2147/NDT.S291793 ","Keywords":"depression\r\nforced swimming test\r\nnatural supplements\r\ntail suspension test","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Saleh LA, Almutairi FM, Alorabi WK, Alkuhayli BA, Alzaidi SS, Alzahrani SB, Aljumayi FA, Abduljabbar MH, Alharthi AS, Alsufyani MA, Alhazmi MH, Althobaiti AA, Almutairi FN, Alshehri FS, Altowairqi E, and Althobaiti YS (2021) Short- and Long-Term Effects of Vitamin D Treatment on Bacillus Calmette-Guerin-Induced Depressive-Like Behavior in Mice..

Psychological deficits such as anxiety, depression, impaired memory and cognitive decline are caused by noise stress. Different vitamins have been used as a potential antioxidant for neuronal protection. In this study we investigate the anxiolytic, antidepressant and memory enhancing effect of vitamin D2 (Vit D2) following noise stress. Thirty-six albino rats were randomly divided into six groups. (i) Unstressed + corn oil (ii) Unstressed + Vit D2 (iii) Acute noise stress + corn oil (iv) Acute noise stress + Vit D2 (v) Repeated noise stress + corn oil (vi) Repeated noise stress + Vit D2. 600 IU/kg body weight of Vit D2 dosage was prepared in corn oil. Corn oil is used as vehicle and all the drugs administered via oral gavage till end of the experiment (day 16). Recorded sound of generator which was amplified by speakers and had 100 dB intensity was used as noise stress. Repeated stressed animals were exposed to noise (4-hrs) daily for 14 days, while acute stressed animals were exposed to noise (4-hrs) once after 14 days. Behavioral tests (elevated plus maze, light dark box, tail suspension test and Morris water maze) of all groups were performed after15 days treatment period. After behavioral tests rats received their last dosage and decapitated after 1-hr. Brain of all animals was removed and used for biochemical (oxidative stress biomarker, antioxidant enzymes and acetylcholinesterase) and histopathological estimations. Results show that Vit D2 decreased time spent in light box and open arm of light dark activity box and elevated plus maze test respectively (used for anxiety evaluation), decreased immobility time in tail suspension test (for depression) and improved cognitive ability evaluated by Morris water maze test in acute and repeated noise stressed rats. Furthermore, increased antioxidant enzymes activity, decreased lipid peroxidation and acetylcholinesterase activity were also observed in Vit D2 treated animals following acute and repeated noise stress. Normalization in histopathological studies was also observed in Vit D2 treated following acute and repeated noise stress. It is concluded that Vit D2 protects from noise stress induced behavioral, biochemical and histopathological impairment through its antioxidant potential.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Samad N ; Imran A ; Bhatti SA ; Imran I ; Alqahtani F ; Alasmari AF ; Sivandzade F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.09.018 ","Keywords":"Antioxidant enzymes\r\nHistopathological studies\r\nNoise stress\r\nOxidative stress\r\nVitamin D2","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Samad N, Imran A, Bhatti SA, Imran I, Alqahtani F, Alasmari AF, and Sivandzade F (2022) Vitamin D2 protects acute and repeated noise stress induced behavioral, biochemical, and histopathological alterations: Possible antioxidant effect..

This review article was produced by researching data and studies to prove a relationship between Vitamin B12 and depression. Numerous studies were reviewed, and based on these studies, it was concluded that supplementation of Vitamin B12 early enough can delay the onset of depression and improve the effect of anti-depressants when used in conjunction with Vitamin B12. Although other vitamins like Vitamin B6 and folate are known to have an impact on depression, we have primarily focused on Vitamin B12 in an attempt to offer the providers a foundation to address this concern with their patients prone to depression or have had a major depressive episode in their life.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sangle P ; Sandhu O ; Aftab Z ; Anthony AT ; Khan S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.7759/cureus.11169 ","Keywords":"depression prevention\r\nhyperhomocysteinemia\r\nneuro-psychiatric\r\nserum vitamin b12","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sangle P, Sandhu O, Aftab Z, Anthony AT, and Khan S (2020) Vitamin B12 Supplementation: Preventing Onset and Improving Prognosis of Depression..

Much evidence exists in the area of adjuvant application of folic acid, S-adenosyl-methionine, omega-3, and L-tryptophan with antidepressants. Current evidence does not support omega-3 as an effective monotherapy to treat depression. However, this may be due, at least in part, to olive oil being used as the control intervention, some studies using docosahexaenoic acid alone or a higher docosahexaenoic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid ratio, and significant heterogeneity regarding depressive populations. Nevertheless, adjunctive prescription of omega-3 with antidepressants, or in people with dietary deficiency, may be beneficial. Inositol lacks evidence as an effective antidepressant and cannot be currently recommended. Evidence on the use of L-tryptophan for depression is inconclusive, and additional studies utilizing a more robust methodology are required.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sarris J ; Schoendorfer N ; Kavanagh DJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1753-4887.2009.00180.x ","Keywords":"Amino Acids/administration & dosage\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage\r\nChemotherapy, Adjuvant\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/administration & dosage\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/administration & dosage\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage\r\nFolic Acid/administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\n*Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nNutritional Status\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/administration & dosage\r\nTryptophan/administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sarris J, Schoendorfer N, and Kavanagh DJ (2009) Major depressive disorder and nutritional medicine: a review of monotherapies and adjuvant treatments..

The adjunctive use of standardized pharmaceutical-grade nutrients, known as nutraceuticals, has the potential to modulate several neurochemical pathways implicated in depression. While many studies have been conducted in this area, to date no specialized systematic review (or meta-analysis) has been conducted. METHOD: A systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was conducted up to December 2015 for clinical trials using adjunctive nutrients for depression. Where sufficient data were available, a random-effects model analyzed the standard mean difference between treatment and placebo in the change from baseline to endpoint, combining the effect size data. Funnel plot and heterogeneity analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Primarily positive results were found for replicated studies testing S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), methylfolate, omega-3 (primarily EPA or ethyl-EPA), and vitamin D, with positive isolated studies for creatine, folinic acid, and an amino acid combination. Mixed results were found for zinc, folic acid, vitamin C, and tryptophan, with nonsignificant results for inositol. No major adverse effects were noted in the studies (aside from minor digestive disturbance). A meta-analysis of adjunctive omega-3 versus placebo revealed a significant and moderate to strong effect in favor of omega-3. Conversely, a meta-analysis of folic acid revealed a nonsignificant difference from placebo. Marked study heterogeneity was found in a Higgins test for both omega-3 and folic acid studies; funnel plots also revealed asymmetry (reflecting potential study bias). CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supports adjunctive use of SAMe, methylfolate, omega-3, and vitamin D with antidepressants to reduce depressive symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sarris J ; Murphy J ; Mischoulon D ; Papakostas GI ; Fava M ; Berk M ; Ng CH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ajp.2016.15091228 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*diet therapy/*drug therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements/adverse effects\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sarris J, Murphy J, Mischoulon D, Papakostas GI, Fava M, Berk M, and Ng CH (2016) Adjunctive Nutraceuticals for Depression: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses..

To address this, the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Disorders (CANMAT) convened an international taskforce involving 31 leading academics and clinicians from 15 countries, between 2019 and 2021. These guidelines are aimed at providing a definitive evidence-informed approach to assist clinicians in making decisions around the use of such agents for major psychiatric disorders. We also provide detail on safety and tolerability, and clinical advice regarding prescription (e.g. indications, dosage), in addition to consideration for use in specialised populations. METHODS: The methodology was based on the WFSBP guidelines development process. Evidence was assessed based on the WFSBP grading of evidence (and was modified to focus on Grade A level evidence - meta-analysis or two or more RCTs - due to the breadth of data available across all nutraceuticals and phytoceuticals across major psychiatric disorders). The taskforce assessed both the 'level of evidence' (LoE) (i.e. meta-analyses or RCTs) and the assessment of the direction of the evidence, to determine whether the intervention was 'Recommended' (+++), 'Provisionally Recommended' (++), 'Weakly Recommended' (+), 'Not Currently Recommended' (+/-), or 'Not Recommended' (-) for a particular condition. Due to the number of clinical trials now available in the field, we firstly examined the data from our two meta-reviews of meta-analyses (nutraceuticals conducted in 2019, and phytoceuticals in 2020). We then performed a search of additional relevant RCTs and reported on both these data as the primary drivers supporting our clinical recommendations. Lower levels of evidence, including isolated RCTs, open label studies, case studies, preclinical research, and interventions with only traditional or anecdotal use, were not assessed. RESULTS: Amongst nutraceuticals with Grade A evidence, positive directionality and varying levels of support (<i>recommended, provisionally recommended,</i> or <i>weakly recommended)</i> was found for adjunctive omega-3 fatty acids (+++), vitamin D (+), adjunctive probiotics (++), adjunctive zinc (++), methylfolate (+), and adjunctive s-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) (+) in the treatment of unipolar depression. Monotherapy omega-3 (+/-), folic acid (-), vitamin C (-), tryptophan (+/-), creatine (+/-), inositol (-), magnesium (-), and n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) (+/-) and SAMe (+/-) were not supported for this use. In bipolar disorder, omega-3 had weak support for bipolar depression (+), while NAC was not currently recommended (+/-). NAC was weakly recommended (+) in the treatment of OCD-related disorders; however, no other nutraceutical had sufficient evidence in any anxiety-related disorder. Vitamin D (+), NAC (++), methylfolate (++) were recommended to varying degrees in the treatment of the negative symptoms in schizophrenia, while omega-3 fatty acids were not, although evidence suggests a role for prevention of transition to psychosis in high-risk youth, with potential pre-existing fatty acid deficiency. Micronutrients (+) and vitamin D (+) were weakly supported in the treatment of ADHD, while omega-3 (+/-) and omega-9 fatty acids (-), acetyl L carnitine (-), and zinc (+/-) were not supported. Phytoceuticals with supporting Grade A evidence and positive directionality included St John's wort (+++), saffron (++), curcumin (++), and lavender (+) in the treatment of unipolar depression, while rhodiola use was not supported for use in mood disorders. Ashwagandha (++), galphimia (+), and lavender (++) were modestly supported in the treatment of anxiety disorders, while kava (-) and chamomile (+/-) were not recommended for generalised anxiety disorder. Ginkgo was weakly supported in the adjunctive treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia (+), but not supported in the treatment of ADHD (+/-). With respect to safety and tolerability, all interventions were deemed to have varying acceptable levels of safety and tolerability for low-risk over-the-counter use in most circumstances. Quality and standardisation of phytoceuticals was also raised by the taskforce as a key limiting issue for firmer confidence in these agents. Finally, the taskforce noted that such use of nutraceuticals or phytoceuticals be primarily recommended (where supportive evidence exists) adjunctively within a standard medical/health professional care model, especially in cases of more severe mental illness. Some meta-analyses reviewed contained data from heterogenous studies involving poor methodology. Isolated RCTs and other data such as open label or case series were not included, and it is recognised that an absence of data does not imply lack of efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current data and clinician input, a range of nutraceuticals and phytoceuticals were given either a supportive recommendation or a provisional recommendation across a range of various psychiatric disorders. However several had only a weak endorsement for potential use; for a few it was not possible to reach a clear recommendation direction, largely due to mixed study findings; while some other agents showed no obvious therapeutic benefit and were clearly not recommended for use. It is the intention of these guidelines to inform psychiatric/medical, and health professional practice globally.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sarris J ; Ravindran A ; Yatham LN ; Marx W ; Rucklidge JJ ; McIntyre RS ; Akhondzadeh S ; Benedetti F ; Caneo C ; Cramer H ; Cribb L ; de Manincor M ; Dean O ; Deslandes AC ; Freeman MP ; Gangadhar B ; Harvey BH ; Kasper S ; Lake J ; Lopresti A ; Lu L ; Metri NJ ; Mischoulon D ; Ng CH ; Nishi D ; Rahimi R ; Seedat S ; Sinclair J ; Su KP ; Zhang ZJ ; Berk M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15622975.2021.2013041 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nHumans\r\n*Biological Psychiatry\r\nCanada\r\n*Mental Disorders/drug therapy\r\nAnxiety\r\nDietary Supplements\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3\r\nVitamin D\r\nZinc\r\nADHD\r\nNutrients\r\naffective disorders\r\nherbal medicines\r\nschizophrenia","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sarris J, Ravindran A, Yatham LN, Marx W, Rucklidge JJ, McIntyre RS, Akhondzadeh S, Benedetti F, Caneo C, Cramer H, Cribb L, de Manincor M, Dean O, Deslandes AC, Freeman MP, Gangadhar B, Harvey BH, Kasper S, Lake J, Lopresti A, Lu L, Metri NJ, Mischoulon D, Ng CH, Nishi D, Rahimi R, Seedat S, Sinclair J, Su KP, Zhang ZJ, and Berk M (2022) Clinician guidelines for the treatment of psychiatric disorders with nutraceuticals and phytoceuticals: The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce..

METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of the medical records of patients > 60 years of age discharged from a geriatric psychiatry unit between June 1, 2014, and February 1, 2016. Two groups were compared: those with depression who received folinic acid (leucovorin) supplementation (n = 35) and those with depression who did not receive leucovorin (n = 80). The primary outcome measure was number of clinically needed days of hospitalization. RESULTS: The mean ± SD number of days (logged) of clinically needed hospitalization in the leucovorin group was 2.0 ± 0.7 compared with 2.4 ± 0.6 in the nonintervention group. Unpaired t group analysis yielded the following: t(115) = 3.47, P < .0001 (2-tailed). CONCLUSIONS: The patients who received leucovorin had a significantly reduced requirement of days of hospitalization, which translates to reduced cumulative cost of treatment during hospitalization. Further studies, including randomized controlled trials, are recommended to explore this treatment option.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Saxena PP ; Kyomen H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/PCC.20m02767 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAntidepressive Agents\r\n*Depression\r\nHumans\r\n*Inpatients\r\nLeucovorin\r\nRetrospective Studies","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Saxena PP, and Kyomen H (2021) Leucovorin as an Antidepressant Adjunct in Elderly Inpatients With Treatment-resistant Depression..

The supplements included were inositol, vitamin D, folic acid, vitamin B12, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) and zinc. A structured database search (MEDLINE, EBSCO, CENTRAL, Web of Science) was performed using terms for the respective substances in conjunction with terms for depression and the mode of treatment (\"add-on\" OR \"adjunctive\" OR \"augmentation\"). Meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized comparative studies that investigated the supplements as an add-on in the treatment of clinically diagnosed MDD were included. Agents had to be added to an existing antidepressant regime (augmentation) or started simultaneously with the antidepressant (acceleration). For n-3 PUFAs, folic acid and zinc, new meta-analyses were performed as part of this work. Our meta-analyses of 10 articles on n-3 PUFAs and four on zinc support their efficacy. For folic acid, our meta-analysis does not support efficacy. For n-3 PUFAs, sensitivity analysis showed no difference between acceleration and augmentation designs, but significant differences between individuals with or without comorbidities. For the remaining substances, only a few RCTs were available. The preliminary data on inositol was negative, while one RCT for vitamin D demonstrated positive results. For vitamin B12 one and for SAMe two RCTs and a few open trials are available reporting positive and mixed results. To summarize, for most of the substances, the available data is not yet sufficient or inconclusive.","Comments":"the available data is not yet sufficient or inconclusive.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schefft C ; Kilarski LL ; Bschor T ; Köhler S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.euroneuro.2017.07.004 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepressive Disorder/*therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\nAugmentation\r\nEfficacy\r\nNutritional supplements\r\nSystematic review\r\nUnipolar depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schefft C, Kilarski LL, Bschor T, and Köhler S (2017) Efficacy of adding nutritional supplements in unipolar depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis..

An inherited large frame requires a corresponding body contour, and dieting to change this situation will be in vain. All weight reducing diets must provide an adequate amount of vitamins and minerals. Women on the contraceptive pill often have diminished serum levels of folic acid and vitamin B6, and there have been suggestions that vitamin supplementation may help overcome depression and diminished libido in some women. This has been partially successful. A well-balanced diet should be recommended prior to trial of supplements. During pregnancy and lactation there is an increased need for protein, calcium, iron, iodide and fluoride. Vitamin and iron supplementation may be required where deficiencies exist due to dietary neglect. Excessive alcohol and smoking should be discouraged--especially during pregnancy. The elderly are particularly vulnerable to diseases of nutritional deficiency for various reasons. The importance of foods providing protein, calcium and vitamins should be stressed, as these are the main nutrients lacking. The consumption of meat, milk, cheese, eggs, fish, fresh fruit and vegetables should be encouraged.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Segal W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nBreast Feeding\r\nCeliac Disease/etiology\r\nChild\r\nChild Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nChild, Preschool\r\nDiet\r\nDietary Proteins\r\nFamily Practice\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfant\r\nInfant Food/adverse effects\r\nInfant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nMale\r\nMilk, Human\r\nNutrition Disorders/etiology\r\n*Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nNutritional Requirements\r\nObesity\r\nPregnancy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Segal W (1977) Nutrition and family practice..

Although low vitamin D levels have been observationally associated with depressive symptoms, the effect of vitamin D supplementation as an antidepressant remains uncertain. METHODS: MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED, PsycINFO, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, and references of included reports (through May 2013) were searched. Two independent reviewers identified and extracted data from randomized trials that compared the effect of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms to a control condition. Two additional reviewers assessed study quality using The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Seven trials (3191 participants) were included. RESULTS: Vitamin D supplementation had no overall effect on depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.33 to 0.05, p = .16), although considerable heterogeneity was observed. Subgroup analysis showed that vitamin D supplementation for participants with clinically significant depressive symptoms or depressive disorder had a moderate, statistically significant effect (2 studies: SMD, -0.60; 95% CI, -1.19 to -0.01; p = .046), but a small, nonsignificant effect for those without clinically significant depression (5 studies: SMD, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.20 to 0.12; p = .61). Most trials had unclear or high risk of bias. Studies varied in the amount, frequency, duration, and mode of delivery of vitamin D supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation may be effective for reducing depressive symptoms in patients with clinically significant depression; however, further high-quality research is needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shaffer JA ; Edmondson D ; Wasson LT ; Falzon L ; Homma K ; Ezeokoli N ; Li P ; Davidson KW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/PSY.0000000000000044 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nData Interpretation, Statistical\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin D/*therapeutic use\r\nVitamins/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shaffer JA, Edmondson D, Wasson LT, Falzon L, Homma K, Ezeokoli N, Li P, and Davidson KW (2014) Vitamin D supplementation for depressive symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials..

In this double-blind randomized controlled trial, 90 mild to moderate UC patients were assigned to receive a single injection of 300,000 IU vitamin D3 or 1 ml normal saline as placebo. At baseline and 3 months later, measurements of BDI score and serum 25-OH-vitamin D3 were done. Data were compared by independent sample t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Baseline BDI scores were not statistically different between the two groups (p = .4); scores decreased in the vitamin D group after the intervention (p = .023). Further subgroup analysis regarding baseline serum vitamin D levels and adjusted for baseline BDIs revealed lowering effect of vitamin D on BDI scores only in subgroup with baseline serum vitamin D levels equal to or higher than 30 ng/ml (p < .001). In this study, there was a statistically significant reduction in BDI score in mild to moderate UC patients 3 months after 300,000 IU vitamin D3 injection. Subgroup analysis showed that patients with sufficient baseline vitamin D may benefit from supplementation more than vitamin D-deficient patients, which indicates that higher serum vitamin D levels may be needed for its antidepressant effect.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sharifi A ; Vahedi H ; Nedjat S ; Mohamadkhani A ; Hosseinzadeh Attar MJ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/19390211.2018.1472168 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCalcifediol/blood\r\nCholecalciferol/*administration & dosage\r\nColitis, Ulcerative/*psychology\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPlacebos\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/drug therapy\r\nBDI\r\nIBD\r\ndepression\r\nulcerative colitis\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sharifi A, Vahedi H, Nedjat S, Mohamadkhani A, and Hosseinzadeh Attar MJ (2019) Vitamin D Decreases Beck Depression Inventory Score in Patients with Mild to Moderate Ulcerative Colitis: A Double-Blind Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial..

There is an unmet need to develop therapeutic strategies to treat both diabetes mellitus and comorbid depression. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of metformin and ascorbic acid against type 2 diabetes mellitus and comorbid depression in rats. Four groups of diabetic rats were orally administered with vehicle (1mL/kg), metformin (25mg/kg), ascorbic acid (25mg/kg), or combination of metformin (25mg/kg) and ascorbic acid (25mg/kg) for 11 consecutive days. Diabetes was induced by single-dose administration of streptozotocin (65mg/kg, i.p.) with nicotinamide (120mg/kg, i.p.). Comorbid depression was induced by five inescapable foot-shocks (2mA, 2ms duration) at 10s intervals on days 1, 5, 7, and 10. One group of healthy rats received only vehicles to serve as nondiabetic control group. On day 11, animals were sacrificed, and blood and brain samples were collected from each rat following forced swim test. Plasma glucose, insulin, and corticosterone levels were estimated in plasma. The levels of monoamines, proinflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress were measured in prefrontal cortex. The combination therapy significantly reduced immobility period, glucose, and corticosterone levels relative to diabetes with comorbid depression group. Furthermore, the combination therapy increased the levels of insulin and monoamines, and caused a significant reductions in oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, the present study revealed that metformin and ascorbic acid combination therapy could be a potential strategy to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus and comorbid depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shivavedi N ; Kumar M ; Tej GNVC ; Nayak PK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.brainres.2017.08.019 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAscorbic Acid/metabolism/*pharmacology\r\nBiogenic Monoamines/metabolism\r\nBlood Glucose\r\nComorbidity\r\nCorticosterone/blood\r\nCytokines/drug effects\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy\r\nDiabetes Mellitus, Experimental/drug therapy\r\nDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nInsulin/blood\r\nMale\r\nMetformin/metabolism/*pharmacology\r\nOxidative Stress/drug effects\r\nRats\r\nRats, Inbred Strains\r\nAscorbic acid\r\nCombination therapy\r\nComorbid depression\r\nDiabetes\r\nMetformin\r\nMonoamines","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shivavedi N, Kumar M, Tej GNVC, and Nayak PK (2017) Metformin and ascorbic acid combination therapy ameliorates type 2 diabetes mellitus and comorbid depression in rats..

Diabetes mellitus was induced by single intraperitoneal injections of nicotinamide (120 mg/kg) and streptozotocin (65 mg/kg) administered 15 min apart. Diabetic (blood glucose ≥250 mg/dL) rats were subjected to intermittent foot-shocks to induce comorbid depression. Seven groups of diabetes comorbid depressed rats received vehicle (1 mL/kg) or AA (10, 25, 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg) orally for eleven days. Three control groups namely- nondiabetic, diabetic, and depressed rats received the vehicles only. The potency (ED(50)) and efficacy (E(max)) of AA against immobility period, hypercorticosteronemia, adrenal hyperplasia, hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response were estimated. AA administration caused a dose-dependent decrease (P < 0.05) in immobility period with maximum inhibition of 69% (efficacy) at 200 mg/kg and ED(50) of 14 mg/kg (potency). AA at 200 mg/kg produced the maximal reduction in hypercorticosteronemia (55.1%) and adrenal hyperplasia (52.6%) with ED(50) of 9.8 and 14.4 mg/kg, respectively. AA at 400 mg/kg produced the maximal reduction in hyperglycemia (35.5%), hypoinsulinemia (32.7%), and lipid peroxidation (82%) with ED(50) of 18.6, 13.7, and 20.7 mg/kg, respectively. Moreover, AA at 400 mg/kg produced the maximal increase in SOD content (83%), CAT activity (77.9%), and IL-10 level (63%) with ED(50) of 21.5, 21, and 21 mg/kg, respectively. In conclusion, the present results suggest that AA has therapeutic potential against diabetes comorbid depression but better regulation of hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia is required to achieve maximal benefits.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shivavedi N ; Charan Tej GNV; Neogi K ; Nayak PK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopha.2018.10.070 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntioxidants/*therapeutic use\r\nAscorbic Acid/*therapeutic use\r\nComorbidity\r\nDepression/chemically induced/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDiabetes Mellitus, Experimental/chemically induced/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nMale\r\nNiacinamide/administration & dosage/*toxicity\r\nRats\r\nStreptozocin/administration & dosage/*toxicity\r\nVitamin B Complex/administration & dosage/toxicity\r\nAscorbic acid\r\nDiabetes comorbid depression\r\nForced swim test\r\nHyperglycemia\r\nIL-10\r\nOxidative stress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shivavedi N, Charan Tej GNV, Neogi K, and Nayak PK (2019) Ascorbic acid therapy: A potential strategy against comorbid depression-like behavior in streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced diabetic rats..

We hypothesized that an 8 week Vitamin D3 supplementation would improve symptoms of mania, decrease ACC glutamate, and increase ACC GABA in BSD patients. Single time point metabolite levels were also evaluated in typically developing children (TD). METHODS: The BSD group included patients not only diagnosed with BD but also those exhibiting bipolar symptomology, including BD not otherwise specified (BD-NOS) and subthreshold mood ratings (Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS] ≥8 and Clinical Global Impressions - Severity [CGI-S] ≥3). Inclusion criteria were: male or female participants, 6-17 years old. Sixteen youth with BSD exhibiting manic symptoms and 19 TD were included. BSD patients were asked to a take daily dose (2000 IU) of Vitamin D3 (for 8 weeks) as a supplement. Neuroimaging data were acquired in both groups at baseline, and also for the BSD group at the end of 8 week Vitamin D3 supplementation. RESULTS: Baseline ACC GABA/creatine (Cr) was lower in BSD than in TD (F[1,31]=8.91, p=0.007). Following an 8 week Vitamin D3 supplementation, in BSD patients, there was a significant decrease in YMRS scores (t=-3.66, p=0.002, df=15) and Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) scores (t=-2.93, p=0.01, df=15); and a significant increase in ACC GABA (t=3.18, p=0.007, df=14). CONCLUSIONS: Following an 8 week open label trial with Vitamin D3, BSD patients exhibited improvement in their mood symptoms in conjunction with their brain neurochemistry.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sikoglu EM ; Navarro AA ; Starr D ; Dvir Y ; Nwosu BU ; Czerniak SM ; Rogan RC ; Castro MC ; Edden RA ; Frazier JA ; Moore CM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1089/cap.2014.0110 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAffect/drug effects\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nChild\r\nCholecalciferol/*therapeutic use\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nGlutamic Acid/metabolism\r\nGyrus Cinguli/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\ngamma-Aminobutyric Acid/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sikoglu EM, Navarro AA, Starr D, Dvir Y, Nwosu BU, Czerniak SM, Rogan RC, Castro MC, Edden RA, Frazier JA, and Moore CM (2015) Vitamin D3 Supplemental Treatment for Mania in Youth with Bipolar Spectrum Disorders..

METHODS: We first conducted a population-based cross-sectional investigation of healthy young adults (n = 214, 20-39 years), and analyzed the associations of serum vitamin C concentrations with vitality (fatigue and attention) and mood status (stress, depression, and positive and negative affect) using Pearson's correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. Next, we performed a double-blind RCT in healthy subjects whose serum vitamin C concentrations were inadequate (< 50 μmol/L). Subjects were randomly allocated to receive 500 mg of vitamin C twice a day for 4 weeks (n = 24) or a placebo (n = 22). We assessed vitality, which included fatigue, attention, work engagement, and self-control resources, and measured mood status, including stress, depression, positive and negative affect, and anxiety. ELISA determined serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and a Stroop color-word test evaluated attention capacity and processing speed. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional data, the serum vitamin C concentration was positively associated with the level of attention (r = 0.16, p = 0.02; standardized β = 0.21, p = 0.003), while no significant associations with the levels of fatigue and mood variables being found. In the RCT, compared to the placebo, the vitamin C supplementation significantly increased attention (p = 0.03) and work absorption (p = 0.03) with distinct tendency of improvement on fatigue (p = 0.06) and comprehensive work engagement (p = 0.07). The vitamin C supplementation did not affect mood and serum concentrations of BDNF. However, in the Stroop color-word test, the subjects supplemented with vitamin C showed better performance than those in the placebo group (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Inadequate vitamin C status is related to a low level of mental vitality. Vitamin C supplementation effectively increased work motivation and attentional focus and contributed to better performance on cognitive tasks requiring sustained attention.

Therefore, there is a need to study and evaluate effects of certain conditions for anti-aging of the brain. Nutrient supplementation can modify the brain function. The chemistry and function of both the developing and the mature brain are influenced by diet (Fernstrom, Am J Clinical Nutrition 71:1669S-1673S, 2000). Clinical, biochemical, and pathological aspects have shown a correlation between mental symptoms, especially depression and cognitive decline, with high incidence of folate deficiency (Bottiglieri et al., J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 69:562, 2000). In the present study, consequences of folic acid supplementation on brain dysfunction as a result of aging were studied in cerebral cortex, mid brain, and cerebellar regions of rat brain. This study was carried out on 6-, 11-, and 16-month-old rats, which received folic acid at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight/day for a period of 8 weeks. Respective control groups of the same age groups were also taken. At the end of the treatment duration, behavioral studies were performed and later the animals were killed for various biochemical and histological investigations. Results indicated significant improvement in memory as assessed by active avoidance, passive avoidance, and plus maze tests in the folic acid supplemented aged animals. Significant improvement was also seen in the cellular protective mechanisms where by the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes increased in folic acid supplemented group and so was the glutathione content. Increased lipid peroxidation content, a marker of aging, was also found to be decreased during folic acid supplementation in all the three regions of brain in our study. Thus, it can be concluded that folic acid helps in improving the memory status by reducing oxidative stress and maintaining the integrity of neurons during aging.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Singh R ; Kanwar SS ; Sood PK ; Nehru B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s10571-010-9557-1 ","Keywords":"Aging/drug effects/*metabolism/physiology\r\nAnimals\r\nAntioxidants/*metabolism\r\nAvoidance Learning/drug effects\r\nBrain/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nCognition Disorders/drug therapy/etiology\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/*pharmacology\r\nFolic Acid Deficiency/complications/drug therapy\r\nHealth Status Indicators\r\nMemory/*drug effects/physiology\r\nOxidative Stress/drug effects\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nUp-Regulation/drug effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Singh R, Kanwar SS, Sood PK, and Nehru B (2011) Beneficial effects of folic acid on enhancement of memory and antioxidant status in aged rat brain..

Pain in migraine is mediated by the release of inflammatory mediators at the level of nerves and blood vessels. The antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of vitamin D in the central nervous system suggest that deficiency of this vitamin can be involved in migraine. Moreover, low serum levels of vitamin D correlates with a higher incidence of chronic pain, including migraine and in co-administered with anti-migraine treatment reduces the frequency of migraine attacks. We report a 46-year old woman affected by migraine, anxiety and mild depressive mood (MSQ score: 24; BDI score: 34; VAS score: 8) that partially improved with pregabalin treatment (VAS: 5).

OBJECTIVE: We examined whether dietary intakes of vitamins B-6, folate, or vitamin B-12 were predictive of depressive symptoms over an average of 7.2 y in a community-based population of older adults. DESIGN: The study sample consisted of 3503 adults from the Chicago Health and Aging project, an ongoing, population-based, biracial (59% African American) study in adults aged > or =65 y. Dietary assessment was made by food-frequency questionnaire. Incident depression was measured by the presence of > or =4 depressive symptoms from the 10-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. RESULTS: The logistic regression models, which used generalized estimating equations, showed that higher total intakes, which included supplementation, of vitamins B-6 and B-12 were associated with a decreased likelihood of incident depression for up to 12 y of follow-up, after adjustment for age, sex, race, education, income, and antidepressant medication use. For example, each 10 additional milligrams of vitamin B-6 and 10 additional micrograms of vitamin B-12 were associated with 2% lower odds of depressive symptoms per year. There was no association between depressive symptoms and food intakes of these vitamins or folate. These associations remained after adjustment for smoking, alcohol use, widowhood, caregiving status, cognitive function, physical disability, and medical conditions. CONCLUSION: Our results support the hypotheses that high total intakes of vitamins B-6 and B-12 are protective of depressive symptoms over time in community-residing older adults.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Skarupski KA ; Tangney C ; Li H ; Ouyang B ; Evans DA ; Morris MC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3945/ajcn.2010.29413 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nDepression/etiology/*prevention & control\r\nDiet Surveys\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nLogistic Models\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nMale\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nVitamin B 12/administration & dosage\r\nVitamin B 6/administration & dosage\r\nVitamin B Complex/*administration & dosage\r\nVitamin B Deficiency/*complications","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Skarupski KA, Tangney C, Li H, Ouyang B, Evans DA, and Morris MC (2010) Longitudinal association of vitamin B-6, folate, and vitamin B-12 with depressive symptoms among older adults over time..

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the association of vitamin D supplement use with depressive symptoms and cardiac events in heart failure patients with mild or moderate to severe depressive symptoms. METHODS: A total of 177 heart failure patients with depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥5) completed a three-day food diary to determine dietary vitamin D deficiency. Patients were split into four groups by dietary vitamin D adequacy versus deficiency and vitamin D supplement use versus non-use. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to reassess depressive symptoms at six months. Data on cardiac events for up to one year and vitamin D supplement use were obtained from patient interview and medical record review. Hierarchical linear and Cox regressions were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (37.3%) had dietary vitamin D deficiency and 80 (45.2%) used vitamin D supplements. In patients with moderate to severe depressive symptoms, the group with dietary vitamin D deficiency and no supplements had the highest Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score at six months (β=0.542, p<0.001) and shortest cardiac event-free survival ( p<0.001) among the four groups, the group with dietary vitamin D deficiency and no supplements didn't have the highest Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score at six months and shortest cardiac event-free survival in patients with mild depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplements predicted lower depressive symptoms and reduced cardiac events for patients with moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with higher risk of shorter cardiac event-free survival in heart failure patients regardless of vitamin D supplementation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Song EK ; Wu JR ; Moser DK ; Kang SM ; Lennie TA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/1474515117727741 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nDepression/diagnosis/etiology/*prevention & control\r\nDiet\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDisease-Free Survival\r\nFemale\r\nHeart Failure/*complications/*psychology\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nProspective Studies\r\nVitamin D/*therapeutic use\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/complications/drug therapy/*psychology\r\nVitamins/*therapeutic use\r\nHeart failure\r\ndepression\r\nsupplement\r\nsurvival\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Song EK, Wu JR, Moser DK, Kang SM, and Lennie TA (2018) Vitamin D supplements reduce depressive symptoms and cardiac events in heart failure patients with moderate to severe depressive symptoms..

Biological flaws in primary studies is a possible reason meta-analyses of Vitamin D have failed to demonstrate efficacy. This systematic review and meta-analysis of Vitamin D and depression compared studies with and without biological flaws. The systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The literature search was undertaken through four databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies were critically appraised for methodological quality and biological flaws, in relation to the hypothesis and study design. Meta-analyses were performed for studies according to the presence of biological flaws. The 15 RCTs identified provide a more comprehensive evidence-base than previous systematic reviews; methodological quality of studies was generally good and methodology was diverse. A meta-analysis of all studies without flaws demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in depression with Vitamin D supplements (+0.78 CI +0.24, +1.27). Studies with biological flaws were mainly inconclusive, with the meta-analysis demonstrating a statistically significant worsening in depression by taking Vitamin D supplements (-1.1 CI -0.7, -1.5). Vitamin D supplementation (≥800 I.U. daily) was somewhat favorable in the management of depression in studies that demonstrate a change in vitamin levels, and the effect size was comparable to that of anti-depressant medication.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Spedding S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu6041501 ","Keywords":"Depression/*drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nVitamin D/*administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Spedding S (2014) Vitamin D and depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing studies with and without biological flaws..

In 2004, 27% of the overall population was affected by at least one of the most frequent neuropsychiatric diseases such as Alzheimer's dementia, Parkinson's disease, stroke or depression. The annual costs of care exceed those of cancer, cardiovascular conditions and diabetes. In order to delay the onset or course of neurodegenerative diseases, the available potential should be utilized. As well as improving quality of life of patients and relatives, this may reduce the great financial burden caused by neurodegenerative disorders. However, the availability of established drugs or therapeutic agents is very limited. This paper reviews the state of current knowledge as to how homocysteine metabolism is relevant for neurodegenerative and other neuropsychiatric diseases, with particular emphasis on the evidence for prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. In the European countries, many people do not take the recommended daily minimum amount of folate and vitamin B12. Deficiency of these vitamins and secondary changes in the concentrations of associated metabolites, such as methylmalonic acid and homocysteine, may contribute to the onset and progression of neuropsychiatric diseases. This paper reviews the evidence regarding whether substitution of folate and vitamin B12 is beneficial, for example, in cerebrovascular disease, dementia and depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Stanger O ; Fowler B ; Piertzik K ; Huemer M ; Haschke-Becher E ; Semmler A ; Lorenzl S ; Linnebank M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1586/ern.09.75 ","Keywords":"Folic Acid/*therapeutic use\r\nHomocysteine/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nNervous System Diseases/*drug therapy\r\nVitamin B 12/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Stanger O, Fowler B, Piertzik K, Huemer M, Haschke-Becher E, Semmler A, Lorenzl S, and Linnebank M (2009) Homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 in neuropsychiatric diseases: review and treatment recommendations..

In the brain, folate is one nutrient among others involved in the production of the neurotransmitters that affect mood. Studies involving folate supplementation for the treatment of depression have had mixed results but have omitted to take into account the genetic polymorphisms, such as the ones in methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), that affect folate metabolism.

Depression has recently been inversely associated with vitamin D in a meta-analysis, and vitamin D receptor is expressed in brain. This pilot study investigates whether vitamin D replacement ameliorates depressive symptoms in CLD patients and consists of a cross-sectional and an interventional analysis. METHODS: Overall, 111 patients with CLD were included in the cross-sectional analysis. The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) was used to assess depression. Chemiluminescence immunoassay and LC-MS/MS quantified serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. For the interventional analysis, 77 patients with inadequate vitamin D concentrations received 20,000 IU vitamin D per week for six months. The final follow-up was carried out six months post supplementation. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional analysis, 81% of patients (median age 55 years, 47% women) had inadequate baseline vitamin D levels (<30 ng/ml), and 31% presented with depressive symptoms (BDI-II score ≥14). Depression severity correlated inversely with vitamin D level in depressed patients (β = -0.483, P = 0.004). Depression scores improved significantly from baseline in depressed patients after three and six months (P = 0.003 and P = 0.004, respectively) of supplementation, with vitamin D levels increasing to normal (P < 0.0001). Subgroup analyses revealed this anti-depressant effect of vitamin D to occur predominantly in women. The final follow-up showed increases in median BDI-II scores in the setting of decreased vitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D levels correlated with BDI-II scores, and vitamin D replacement significantly improved depressive symptoms in women with CLD. Adjuvant vitamin D may be considered in these patients.

The present study examined for the first time the efficacy of 3 months administration of two forms of high dose vitamin B complex on mood and psychological strain associated with chronic work stress. METHOD: Sixty participants completed the 3-month, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in which personality, work demands, mood, anxiety and strain were assessed. RESULTS: After individual differences in personality and work demands were statistically controlled, the vitamin B complex treatment groups reported significantly lower personal strain and a reduction in confusion and depressed/dejected mood after 12 weeks. There were no treatment-related changes in other measures of mood and anxiety. DISCUSSION: The results of the study are consistent with two previous studies examining multivitamin supplementation and personal (non-work) feelings of strain and suggestive of significant decreases in the experience of workplace stress after 90 day supplementation of a B multivitamin. CONCLUSION: Given the direct and indirect costs of workplace stress, these findings point to the utility of a cost-effective treatment for the mood and psychological strain effects of occupational stress. These findings may have important personal health, organisational and societal outcomes given the rising cost and incidence of workplace stress.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Stough C ; Scholey A ; Lloyd J ; Spong J ; Myers S ; Downey LA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/hup.1229 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAffect/drug effects\r\nAnxiety/drug therapy/etiology\r\nCost-Benefit Analysis\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOccupational Diseases/*drug therapy/economics\r\nStress, Psychological/*drug therapy/economics\r\nVitamin B Complex/administration & dosage/economics/*pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Stough C, Scholey A, Lloyd J, Spong J, Myers S, and Downey LA (2011) The effect of 90 day administration of a high dose vitamin B-complex on work stress..

While levels of individual nutrients in neural tissues are individually associated with cognitive function, the investigation of nutrient patterns in human brain tissue has not been conducted. Methods: Brain tissues were acquired from frontal and temporal cortices of 47 centenarians from the Georgia Centenarian Study. Fat-soluble nutrients (carotenoids, vitamins A, E, K, and fatty acids [FA]) were measured and averaged from the two brain regions. Nutrient patterns were constructed using principal component analysis. Cognitive composite scores were constructed from cognitive assessment from the time point closest to death. Dementia status was rated by Global Deterioration Scale (GDS). Pearson's correlation coefficients between NP scores and cognitive composite scores were calculated controlling for sex, education, hypertension, diabetes, and APOE ε4 allele. Result: Among non-demented subjects (GDS = 1-3, n = 23), a nutrient pattern higher in carotenoids was consistently associated with better performance on global cognition (r = 0.38, p = 0.070), memory (r = 0.38, p = 0.073), language (r = 0.42, p = 0.046), and lower depression (r = -0.40, p = 0.090). The findings were confirmed with univariate analysis. Conclusion: Both multivariate and univariate analyses demonstrate that brain nutrient pattern explained mainly by carotenoid concentrations is correlated with cognitive function among subjects who had no dementia. Investigation of their synergistic roles on the prevention of age-related cognitive impairment remains to be performed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tanprasertsuk J ; Scott TM ; Barbey AK ; Barger K ; Wang XD ; Johnson MA ; Poon LW ; Vishwanathan R ; Matthan NR ; Lichtenstein AH ; Ferland G ; Johnson EJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fnut.2021.704691 ","Keywords":"carotenoids\r\ncentenarian adults\r\ncognition\r\ndementia\r\nfatty acids\r\nvitamin A\r\nvitamin E\r\nvitamin K","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tanprasertsuk J, Scott TM, Barbey AK, Barger K, Wang XD, Johnson MA, Poon LW, Vishwanathan R, Matthan NR, Lichtenstein AH, Ferland G, and Johnson EJ (2021) Carotenoid-Rich Brain Nutrient Pattern Is Positively Correlated With Higher Cognition and Lower Depression in the Oldest Old With No Dementia..

This study was planned to assess whether administration of vitamin D (200,000 IU at first, followed by 25,000 IU every 2 weeks) for a 4-month period might lessen the appearance and the intensity of mood disorders associated with PMS in young girls with severe hypovitaminosis D. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: One hundred fifty-eight young girls (15-21 years old) with PMS-related severe symptoms of the emotional and cognitive domains and low serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OH-D) levels (≤10 ng/mL) were randomly assigned to two treatment groups and treated for 4 months with vitamin D (group 1; n = 80) or placebo (group 2; n = 78). Clinical and hormonal effects were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: In patients from group 1, levels of vitamin D reached the normal range (35-60 ng/mL) after the first month and remained stable throughout the whole study. At the end of treatment, anxiety score decreased from 51 to 20 (P < .001 vs baseline); irritability score declined from 130 to 70 (P < .001 vs baseline). Crying easily and sadness decreased by a score of 41 and 51 to a score of 30 and 31, respectively (P < .001). For disturbed relationships, the score decreased from 150 to 70 (P < .001). Conversely, no appreciable changes were noted in symptom intensity from patients of group 2. The frequency of adverse events (nausea and constipation) was not different between participants of group 1 and group 2. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the present findings, vitamin D therapy can be proposed as a safe, effective, and convenient method for improving the quality of life in young women with severe hypovitaminosis D and concomitant mood disorders associated with PMS.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tartagni M ; Cicinelli MV ; Tartagni MV ; Alrasheed H ; Matteo M ; Baldini D ; De Salvia M ; Loverro G ; Montagnani M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpag.2015.12.006 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMood Disorders/blood/etiology/therapy\r\nPremenstrual Dysphoric Disorder/blood/*therapy\r\nPremenstrual Syndrome/blood/psychology/therapy\r\nVitamin D/*administration & dosage/blood\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/psychology/*therapy\r\nVitamins/*administration & dosage\r\nYoung Adult\r\nAdolescents\r\nMood disorders\r\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS)\r\nVitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tartagni M, Cicinelli MV, Tartagni MV, Alrasheed H, Matteo M, Baldini D, De Salvia M, Loverro G, and Montagnani M (2016) Vitamin D Supplementation for Premenstrual Syndrome-Related Mood Disorders in Adolescents with Severe Hypovitaminosis D..

It is possible that the efficacy of these treatments will be improved further by the use of adjunctive therapies such as folate. OBJECTIVES: 1. To determine the effectiveness of folate in the treatment of depression 2. To determine the adverse effects and acceptability of treatment with folate. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), and the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) incorporating results of group searches of EMBASE, MEDLINE, LILACS, CINAHL, PSYNDEX and PsycLIT were searched. Reference lists of relevant papers and major textbooks of affective disorder were checked. Experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies were contacted regarding unpublished material. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials that compared treatment with folic acid or 5'-methyltetrahydrofolic acid to an alternative treatment, whether another antidepressant medication or placebo, for patients with a diagnosis of depressive disorder (diagnosed according to explicit criteria). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were independently extracted from the original reports by two reviewers. Statistical analysis was conducted using Review Manager version 4.1. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials involving 247 people were included. Two studies involving 151 people assessed the use of folate in addition to other treatment, and found that adding folate reduced Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores on average by a further 2.65 points (95% confidence interval 0.38 to 4.93). Fewer patients treated with folate experienced a reduction in their HDRS score of less than 50% at ten weeks (relative risk (RR) 0.47, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.92) The number needed to treat with folate for one additional person to experience a 50% reduction on this scale was 5 (95% confidence interval 4 to 33). One study involving 96 people assessed the use of folate instead of the antidepressant trazodone and did not find a significant benefit from the use of folate. The trials identified did not find evidence of any problems with the acceptability or safety of folate. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: The limited available evidence suggests folate may have a potential role as a supplement to other treatment for depression. It is currently unclear if this is the case both for people with normal folate levels, and for those with folate deficiency.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Taylor MJ ; Carney S ; Geddes J ; Goodwin G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD003390 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFolic Acid/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Taylor MJ, Carney S, Geddes J, and Goodwin G (2003) Folate for depressive disorders..

Depression is associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: The study investigated the effect of combining low/serotonergic dose of venlafaxine with folic acid in mice exposed to chronic forced swim stress for 21 days during which immobility and swimming time following forced swim test (FST) and immobility time in tail suspension test (TST) were measured every 7th, 14th and 21st day. The serum level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6) and whole brain levels of monoamines (serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine) were estimated. RESULTS: An augmentation of antidepressant effect was observed in both forced swim test and tail suspension test following combination of venlafaxine (2 and 4mg/kg) with folic acid (5 and 10mg/kg) after 14 and 21 days of treatment. On brain serotonin level also, a significant augmentation was observed when venlafaxine (4mg/kg) was combined with folic acid (10mg/kg). Further, the combination significantly reversed the elevated levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and IL-6 observed in chronic FST-induced stressed mice. CONCLUSIONS: Combining low dose venlafaxine with an augmenting agent like folic acid, thus, appears to be an optimum strategy to increase its therapeutic efficacy and to reduce its dose.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Thomas J ; Khanam R ; Vohora D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pharep.2015.10.003 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nBrain/drug effects/metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDopamine/metabolism\r\nFolic Acid/*pharmacology\r\nHindlimb Suspension/physiology\r\nInflammation/drug therapy/*metabolism\r\nInterleukin-1beta/metabolism\r\nInterleukin-6/metabolism\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nNorepinephrine/metabolism\r\nSerotonin/*metabolism\r\nSerotonin Uptake Inhibitors/pharmacology\r\nSwimming/physiology\r\nVenlafaxine Hydrochloride/*pharmacology\r\nChronic forced swim test\r\nCytokines\r\nFolic acid\r\nTail suspension test\r\nVenlafaxine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Thomas J, Khanam R, and Vohora D (2016) Augmentation of effect of venlafaxine by folic acid in behavioral paradigms of depression in mice: Evidence of serotonergic and pro-inflammatory cytokine pathways..

College women (N = 114), all citizens of the United Arab Emirates, were screened for depressive symptoms and VTD deficiency. Those participants who were severely VTD deficient and experiencing clinically significant depressive symptoms, were randomly allocated to either a 12-week program of behavioral activation, emphasizing safe-sun exposure (N = 10), or a waiting list control group (N = 10). At time 2 the sun exposure and behavioral activation (SEBA) group showed a significant increases in 25-hydroxyvitamin D and were, on average, no longer VTD deficient, whereas the control group deteriorated in terms of VTD. Similarly positive results were observed for depressive symptoms.

Due to adverse effects of depression, antidepressants and adjunctive therapies, such as dietary supplementation, are used for treatment. Therefore, this review explored and summarized dietary supplements' types, dosages, and effectiveness in preventing and treating depression. A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted in August 2021 to identify studies assessing depression, after which scale measurements based on dietary supplements were identified. From the obtained 221 studies, we selected 63 papers. Results showed PUFA (EPA and DHA combination), vitamin D, and probiotics as the most common supplementation used in clinical studies to reduce depressive symptoms. We also observed that although the total daily PUFA dosage that exhibited beneficial effects was in the range of 0.7-2 g EPA and 0.4-0.8 g DHA daily, with an administration period of three weeks to four months, positive vitamin D-based supplementation effects were observed after administering doses of 2000 IU/day or 50,000 IU/week between 8 weeks and 24 months. Alternatively, microbes from the genus Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in the probiotic group with a minimum dose of 10(8) CFU in various dose forms effectively treated depression. Besides, a depression scale was helpful to assess the effect of an intervention on depression. Hence, PUFA, vitamin D, and probiotics were proposed as adjunctive therapies for depression treatment based on the results from this study.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Thurfah JN ; Christine  ; Bagaskhara PP ; Alfian SD ; Puspitasari IM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2147/JMDH.S360029 ","Keywords":"PUFA\r\nclinical studies\r\ndepression\r\ndietary supplementation\r\nprobiotics\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Thurfah JN, Christine , Bagaskhara PP, Alfian SD, and Puspitasari IM (2022) Dietary Supplementations and Depression..

Inadequate vitamin D intake has been linked to many health issues, including chronic headache, apathy, aggression and depression. Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency led to dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. The purpose of our study was to estimate the effect of 90-days healthy lifestyle programs along with gut microbiota modulation in university students with vitamin D<inf>3</inf> deficiency. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 130 students (18-25 years old) with vitamin D deficiency were recruited. Both the standard care group (N.=65) and the intervention group (N.=65) received a 3-months course of individually selected nutrition program and physical activity (8000-10,000 steps daily). The intervention group received an additional treatment with synbiotic Acidolac and vitamin D<inf>3</inf> for 3 months. The psycho-emotional status of the participants was assessed by a validated questionnaire that examined situational anxiety. In all students, blood pressure, anthropometric variables, as well as laboratory metabolic parameters, were recorded. RESULTS: In both groups, vitamin D<inf>3</inf> deficiency was associated with instability and lability of mental processes, mood swings, bad sleep, high rates of stuck and agitation for any problem. Combined therapy (diet, physical activity and synbiotic) induced a significant improvement in the psycho-emotional state of students. The 90-days therapy vitamin D<inf>3</inf> increased the level of vitamin D<inf>3</inf> in serum in the intervention group. Lastly, we observed a decrease in the body weight, body mass index, waist circumference and fatty mass, only in students included in the interventional group.

This pilot study aimed to investigate the impact of whole-body narrow-band (NB) UV-B exposure on current mood state and circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D(3)), interleukin-6 (IL-6), cortisol and β-endorphin (β-END) levels in healthy participants. Here, eleven healthy women received full-body NB UV-B exposures on four afternoons, and the chronotype was assessed with a shortened version of Horne and Östberg's Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). Perceived mood was evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and serum 25(OH)D(3), IL-6, cortisol and β-END concentrations were monitored daily. Decreasing VAS values showed mood to improve significantly over the five days after the four suberythematous NB UV-B exposures (p = .038), and the more the circadian preference was inclined toward eveningness, the greater the improvement in the mood dimension of wellbeing (p = .021). Baseline mood state was correlated with baseline 25(OH)D(3) (r = -0.54, 95% CI: -0.86 to -0.09) and with baseline cortisol (r = -0.57, 95% CI: -0.87 to -0.04). During the NB UV-B exposures, 25(OH)D(3) increased significantly, as expected, and IL-6 declined significantly by -0.35 (95% CI: -0.69 to -0.07) pg/mL from the initial values of 1.12 ± 0.66 pg/mL (p = .025). In conclusion, in our pilot study, NB UV-B exposure improved mood, especially among those with evening preference for their daily activities, as well as circulating 25(OH)D(3) levels, whereas circulating IL-6 levels decreased.

However, no published studies have examined the association between dietary folate and current symptoms of depression in a general population. We investigated the association between dietary folate, cobalamin, pyridoxine and riboflavin and current symptoms of depression in a cross-sectional general population study. We recruited 2682 men aged between 42 and 60 y from eastern Finland. Those who had a previous history of psychiatric disorder were excluded (n = 146, 5.6% of the cohort). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the 18-item Human Population Laboratory Depression Scale. Those who scored 5 or more at baseline were considered to have elevated depressive symptoms (n = 228, 9.3% of the cohort). The participants were grouped into thirds according to their dietary folate intake. Those in the lowest third of energy-adjusted folate intake had a higher risk of being depressed [odds ratio (OR) 1.67, 95% CI = 1.19-2.35, P = 0.003] than those in the highest folate intake third. This increased risk remained significant after adjustment for smoking habits, alcohol consumption, appetite, BMI, marital status, education, adulthood socioeconomic status and total fat consumption (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.01-2.12, P = 0.044). There were no associations between the intake of cobalamin, pyridoxine or riboflavin, and depression. These results indicate that nutrition may have a role in the prevention of depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tolmunen T ; Voutilainen S ; Hintikka J ; Rissanen T ; Tanskanen A ; Viinamäki H ; Kaplan GA ; Salonen JT ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/jn/133.10.3233 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAlcohol Drinking\r\nAppetite\r\nBody Mass Index\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/*epidemiology\r\n*Diet\r\nDietary Fats/administration & dosage\r\nEducational Status\r\nFinland/epidemiology\r\nFolic Acid/*administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMarital Status\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPyridoxine/administration & dosage\r\nRiboflavin/administration & dosage\r\nSmoking\r\nSocioeconomic Factors\r\nVitamin B 12/administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tolmunen T, Voutilainen S, Hintikka J, Rissanen T, Tanskanen A, Viinamäki H, Kaplan GA, and Salonen JT (2003) Dietary folate and depressive symptoms are associated in middle-aged Finnish men..

Studies in adults have suggested a link between higher total 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and lower risk of depression. OBJECTIVES: To investigate (a) the association between serum 25(OH)D(2) and 25(OH)D(3) concentrations and depressive symptoms in children, and (b) whether the associations of 25(OH)D(2) and 25(OH)D(3) are different from, and independent of, each other. METHODS: Prospective cohort study with serum 25(OH)D(2) and 25(OH)D(3) concentrations measured at mean age of 9.8 years and depressive symptoms assessed with the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire by a trained interviewer at the mean ages of 10.6 years (n = 2,759) and 13.8 years (n = 2,752). RESULTS: Higher concentrations of 25(OH)D(3) assessed at mean age 9.8 years were associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms at age 13.8 years [adjusted risk ratio (RR; 95% confidence interval (CI)): 0.90 (0.86-0.95)], but not at age 10.6 years [adjusted RR (95% CI): 0.98 (0.93-1.03)] and with increased odds of decreasing symptoms between age 10.6 and 13.8 years [adjusted RR (95% CI): 1.08 (1.01-1.16)]. Serum 25(OH)D(2) concentrations were not associated with depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in children to suggest that the association between 25(OH)D(3) concentrations and depression emerges in childhood. The association is independent of a wide range of potential confounding factors, and appears to be stronger with greater time separation between assessment of 25(OH)D(3) and assessment of depressive symptoms. Confirmation of our findings in large prospective studies and trials would be valuable.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tolppanen AM ; Sayers A ; Fraser WD ; Lewis G ; Zammit S ; Lawlor DA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1469-7610.2011.02518.x ","Keywords":"25-Hydroxyvitamin D 2/*blood\r\nAdolescent\r\nAge Factors\r\nCalcifediol/*blood/physiology\r\nChild\r\nDepression/*blood\r\nEducational Status\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInterview, Psychological\r\nLinear Models\r\nLogistic Models\r\nMale\r\nOdds Ratio\r\nProspective Studies\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSex Factors\r\nSocial Class\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tolppanen AM, Sayers A, Fraser WD, Lewis G, Zammit S, and Lawlor DA (2012) The association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and D2 with depressive symptoms in childhood--a prospective cohort study..

The association between low serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D) and increased risk of depression is reported in both stroke and non-stroke patients. Similarly, high 25(OH) D levels might be associated with greater functional improvement during rehabilitation program.We wanted to investigate the effects of an intensive rehabilitation on poststroke outcomes. We wondered if the daily rehabilitation of motor and cognitive functions could also have an effect on mood and functional abilities in addition to or as an alternative to vitamin D supplementation.We conducted a 12-week, randomized trial, double blind, parallel, monocentric clinical trial of 40 patients undergoing intensive neuro-rehabilitation treatment at a specialized care facility for ischemic or hemorrhagic brain stroke. Participants were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to 1 of 2 parallel groups: in the experimental group, 2000 IU/day of oral cholecalciferol was administered; in the control group patients were not taking vitamin D supplementation. Patients underwent a text evaluation to investigate psychological and motor outcomes.Significant intra-group difference in outcomes measures was found but not between control group and experimental group. In the vitamin D group, we highlighted significant differences between T0 and T1 in calcium (P < .001), vitamin D (P < .001), in Montgomery Aasberg Depression Rating Scale (P = .001), and in Functional Independent Measures (P < .001).

Although most research into risk factors focuses on stress, dietary factors also have a strong link with depression. For instance, chronic vitamin B12-supplementation may reduce depression risk and helps to reverse the prodepressive effects of early life stress in animal models. However, it is still unclear whether a single acute dose of vitamin B12 is sufficient to induce antidepressant effects on molecular or behavioral levels. Based on pharmacological work and CRISPR-dCas9 epigenome editing in Neuro2A-cells we provide in vitro evidence for a link between vitamin B12, gene expression and DNA methylation of the antidepressant-associated gene Ntrk-2, which codes for the BDNF-receptor TRKB. Using stress-induction protocols in C57Bl/6 J mice combined with behavioral testing and subsequent molecular tissue analysis, we establish in vivo evidence for antidepressant effects of vitamin B12. Acute supplementation with vitamin B12, but not folic acid, selectively altered DNA methylation and gene expression of Ntrk-2 in vitro, albeit DNA methylation and Ntrk-2 gene expression do not correlate in vivo. Importantly, one acute vitamin B12 injection improved multiple behavioral measures in tests for antidepressant action and at the same time reversed the effects of chronic and acute stress on Ntrk-2 levels in vivo, however causality has not been proven at this stage. Taken together, acute vitamin B12 supplementation can reverse stress effects on Ntrk-2 gene expression and improve behaviors that are associated with depression-like behavior in mice. Our findings encourage further investigation of vitamin B12-supplementation as a novel model for antidepressant action.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Trautmann C ; Bock A ; Urbach A ; Hübner CA ; Engmann O ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuropharm.2020.108112 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nCRISPR-Cas Systems\r\nCell Line\r\nDNA Methylation/drug effects\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nEpigenomics\r\nFemale\r\nGene Expression/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMembrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/drug effects/metabolism\r\nProtein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors\r\nReceptor, trkB/drug effects\r\nVitamin B 12/*pharmacology\r\nAntidepressant\r\nDNA methylation\r\nDepression\r\nNtrk-2\r\nTrkB\r\nVitamin B12","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Trautmann C, Bock A, Urbach A, Hübner CA, and Engmann O (2020) Acute vitamin B12 supplementation evokes antidepressant response and alters Ntrk-2..

Folate and vitamin B12 are required for biological methylation and DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 also participates in the mitochondrial catabolism of odd-chain fatty acids and some amino acids. Inborn errors of their metabolism and severe nutritional deficiencies cause serious neurological and hematological pathology. Poor folate and vitamin B12 status short of clinical deficiency is associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment, depression, Alzheimer's disease and stroke among older adults and increased risk of neural tube defects among children born to mothers with low folate status. Folate supplementation and food fortification are known to reduce incident neural tube defects, and B vitamin supplementation may have cognitive benefit in older adults. Less is known about folate and vitamin B12 requirements for optimal brain development and long-term cognitive health in newborns, children and adolescents. While increasing suboptimal nutritional status has observed benefits, the long-term effects of high folate intake are uncertain. Several observations of unfavorable health indicators in children and adults exposed to high folic acid intake make it imperative to achieve a more precise definition of folate and B12 requirements for brain development and function.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Troen AM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000337684 ","Keywords":"Aging/drug effects\r\nCentral Nervous System/drug effects\r\nCognition/*drug effects\r\nCognition Disorders/drug therapy/etiology\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nEpigenesis, Genetic\r\nFolic Acid/*administration & dosage\r\nFolic Acid Deficiency/complications/drug therapy\r\n*Food, Fortified\r\nHumans\r\nNeural Tube Defects/drug therapy/etiology\r\nNutritional Status\r\nVitamin B 12/*administration & dosage\r\nVitamin B 12 Deficiency/complications/drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Troen AM (2012) Folate and vitamin B12: function and importance in cognitive development..

Maintaining mobility performance and physical function in the elderly is the main objective of the successful ageing concept. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the beneficial effect of a novel nutraceutical formulation containing Centella asiatica L. extract, vitamin C, zinc and vitamin D3 (as cholecalciferol) on motor activity and anxiety with the use of a murine model of old animals, as a means of providing proof for clinical use in the elderly, for enhancing physical strength and improving life quality. Eighteen Sprague Dawley 18 months old male rats were divided into three groups and received corn oil (the control group) or 1 capsule/kg bw Reverse supplement (treatment group 1) or 2 capsules/kg bw Reverse supplement (treatment group 2), for a period of 3 months. The Reverse supplement (Natural Doctor S.A, Athens, Greece) contains 9 mg Centella asiatica L. extract, vitamin C (200 mg as magnesium ascorbate), zinc (5 mg as zinc citrate), vitamin D3 (50 µg as cholecalciferol) per capsule. Before and after the treatment, the motor function and behavioral changes for anxiety and depression were evaluated using the open-field test, elevated plus-maze test and rotarod test. The supplementation with Reverse (Natural Doctor S.A) supplement can improve the locomotor activity in old rats in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by an increase in the latency to leave from the middle square, in the number of rearings in the open field test, in the time spent in the open arms and time spent in the center in the elevated plus-maze test and the latency to all in all three consecutive trials in the rotarod test. Stress also decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner, following the treatment with Reverse supplement, as was demonstrated by the decrease in the number of groomings at the open field test and time spent in the dark and the number of groomings at the elevated plus-maze test.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tsoukalas D ; Zlatian O ; Mitroi M ; Renieri E ; Tsatsakis A ; Izotov BN ; Burada F ; Sosoi S ; Burada E ; Buga AM ; Rogoveanu I ; Docea AO ; Calina D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/jcm10040624 ","Keywords":"Centella asiatica L.\r\nageing\r\nanxiety levels\r\nmotor performance\r\nvitamin C\r\nvitamin D\r\nzinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tsoukalas D, Zlatian O, Mitroi M, Renieri E, Tsatsakis A, Izotov BN, Burada F, Sosoi S, Burada E, Buga AM, Rogoveanu I, Docea AO, and Calina D (2021) A Novel Nutraceutical Formulation Can Improve Motor Activity and Decrease the Stress Level in a Murine Model of Middle-Age Animals..

The pathway for brain uptake of TRP is shared by other large neutral amino acids; therefore, the best time to take TRP may be between meals. No previous study has, however, designated the time of TRP dosing to improve mood. Further, the effects of TRP on autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity are unclear. This study investigated the effects of TRP, vitamin B(6), and nicotinamide-containing supplements loading between meals on mood and ANS activity in depressive young adults. Thirty depressive young adults were randomly allocated to receive TRP, vitamin B(6), and nicotinamide-containing supplements or a placebo supplements twice daily between meals for 7 d. Mood was measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). ANS activities were analyzed by heart rate variability power spectral analysis. Blood samples were assayed for plasma total TRP concentration. For analysis, TRP and placebo groups were further classified into two subgroups according to CES-D score (mild to moderate vs. severe depressive symptoms). The CES-D score significantly improved following both treatments in the severe depression subgroups, while the POMS depression score was significantly improved only in the TRP severe depression subgroup. There was no significant change in ANS activity or plasma total TRP in any group. TRP, vitamin B(6), and nicotinamide-containing supplements loading between meals can quickly improve depressed mood in quite low dose in young adults with severe subclinical depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tsujita N ; Akamatsu Y ; Nishida MM ; Hayashi T ; Moritani T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3177/jnsv.65.507 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAffect/*drug effects\r\n*Depression/drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHeart Rate/drug effects\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\n*Niacinamide/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nPlacebos/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\n*Tryptophan/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\n*Vitamin B 6/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nYoung Adult\r\ndepressive symptoms\r\nheart rate variability\r\nlarge neutral amino acids\r\nmood\r\nsupplementation\r\nthe Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale\r\nthe Profile of Mood States\r\nyoung adults","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tsujita N, Akamatsu Y, Nishida MM, Hayashi T, and Moritani T (2019) Effect of Tryptophan, Vitamin B(6), and Nicotinamide-Containing Supplement Loading between Meals on Mood and Autonomic Nervous System Activity in Young Adults with Subclinical Depression: A Randomized, Double-Blind, and Placebo-Controlled Study..

A recent study confirms neophobic responses in vitamin D receptor mutant mice. We explored whether the plasma levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)), the active form of vitamin D, are correlated with basic personality traits. METHODS: A total of 206 healthy unrelated volunteers (108 male, 98 female, age 31 ± 13 years) completed the German version of the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), which allows reliable and valid assessment of personality along the dimensions neuroticism, extraversion, openness to new experiences, agreeableness and conscientiousness. RESULTS: We found a significant correlation between 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) concentration and the factor extraversion (n = 206, r = 0.202, p = 0.004) and the factor openness (n = 206, r = 0.148, p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: The possible mechanisms by which 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) acts on the brain might include Ca(2+) signaling, buffering antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory defenses against vascular injury, stimulating neurotrophins and improving metabolic and cardiovascular function. In conclusion, we suggest that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) might influence personality traits, promoting extrovert and open behavior.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ubbenhorst A ; Striebich S ; Lang F ; Lang UE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00213-011-2175-x ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCalcitriol/blood\r\nData Interpretation, Statistical\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nPersonality/*physiology\r\nPersonality Inventory\r\nVitamin D/*blood/physiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ubbenhorst A, Striebich S, Lang F, and Lang UE (2011) Exploring the relationship between vitamin D and basic personality traits..

It seems that anemia is associated with vitamin D deficiency. We aimed to evaluate the effects of iron-vitamin D co-supplementation versus vitamin D alone on depression scores in anemic females with low levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Methods: This randomized controlled trial was conducted on eighty premenopausal females who were recruited between May 2015 and October 2015 from primary health care centers. Women with anemia and low concentrations of 25(OH)D were randomized to either 1000 IU/d vitamin D plus 27 mg/d iron (D-Fe) or vitamin D plus placebo supplements (D-P) for 12 weeks. Depressive and anxious symptoms were evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) with subscales 1-13 and 14-21 and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). To compare the groups, Mann-Whitney or chi-squared tests were used and within groups comparison was performed using Wilcoxon signed ranks test. The study was registered on www.clinicaltrial.org as NC 01876563. Results: The serum concentrations of 25(OH)D were increased significantly in both groups at the end of the study. In both groups, there was a significant improvement in total BDI, the BDI subscale, and the BAI scores (p<0.001). No differences were found between groups (p>0.05). Conclusion: Although the potential positive effect of vitamin D on mental health was evident, iron plus vitamin D co-supplementation did not demonstrate any significant benefits over vitamin D alone, neither in depression score reduction nor anxiety symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vafa M ; Azizi-Soleiman F ; Kazemi SM ; Salehi M ; Zaeri F ; Abiri B ; Sadeghi H ; Safavi M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.34171/mjiri.33.64 ","Keywords":"Anemia\r\nAnxiety\r\nDepression\r\nIron\r\nVitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vafa M, Azizi-Soleiman F, Kazemi SM, Salehi M, Zaeri F, Abiri B, Sadeghi H, and Safavi M (2019) Comparing the effectiveness of vitamin D plus iron vs vitamin D on depression scores in anemic females: Randomized triple-masked trial..

The objective of this study is to examine whether a change of vitamin D in depressed older adults is associated with either depression course, course of frailty, or both. METHODS: The study population consisted of 232 of 378 older adults (60-93 years) with a DSM-IV defined depressive disorder participating in the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older persons, a prospective clinical cohort study. Baseline and 2-year follow-up data on depressive disorder (DSM-IV diagnosis), symptom severity (inventory of depressive symptoms), frailty phenotype (and its individual components) and vitamin D levels were obtained. Linear mixed models were used to study the association of change in vitamin D levels with depression course, course of frailty, and the combination. RESULTS: Vitamin D levels decreased from baseline to follow-up, independent from depression course. An increase in frailty was associated with a significantly sharper decrease of vitamin D levels over time. Post hoc analyses showed that this association with frailty might be driven by an increase of exhaustion over time and counteracted by an increase in walking speed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings generate the hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation in late-life depression may improve frailty, which may partly explain inconsistent findings of randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of vitamin D for depression. We advocate to consider frailty (components) as an outcome in future supplementation trials in late-life depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"van den Berg KS ; Hegeman JM ; van den Brink RHS ; Rhebergen D ; Oude Voshaar RC; Marijnissen RM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/gps.5507 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nCohort Studies\r\nDepression/epidemiology\r\n*Frailty\r\nHumans\r\nNetherlands/epidemiology\r\nProspective Studies\r\n*Vitamin D\r\ndepression\r\nfrailty\r\nlongitudinal associations\r\nold age\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"van den Berg KS, Hegeman JM, van den Brink RHS, Rhebergen D, Oude Voshaar RC, and Marijnissen RM (2021) A prospective study into change of vitamin D levels, depression and frailty among depressed older persons..

Researchers have studied the relationship between low serum vitamin D concentration and perinatal depression, although no clinical trial has been conducted on vitamin D's effects on depression related to childbirth. This study evaluated the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on perinatal depression scores. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was done in pregnant women who were under prenatal care in a teaching hospital in Shiraz, Iran. The inclusion criteria were: being 18 years or older, no history of mental illness and internal diseases, a singleton live fetus, without any pregnancy complications, gestational age of 26-28 weeks upon enrollment, and depression score of 0 to 13. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scale was used to evaluate depression scores. A total of 169 participants were assigned to the two groups of placebo and vitamin D through block randomization design. Vitamin D group received 2000 IU vitamin D3 daily from 26 to 28 weeks of gestation until childbirth. Maternal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were measured at baseline and childbirth. Besides, depression scores were evaluated four times: at 26-28 and 38-40 weeks of gestation, and finally at 4 and 8 weeks after birth. RESULTS: The two groups were similar in relation to baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. However, at childbirth, the vitamin D group had significantly higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in comparison to the control group (p < 0.001). At baseline, no correlation was observed between 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and depression score (r = 0.13, p = 0.09). There was no significant difference between the two study groups in relation to the baseline depression score. While, the vitamin D group had greater reduction in depression scores than the control group at 38-40 weeks of gestation (p = 0.01) also, at 4 and 8 weeks after birth (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The present trial showed that consuming 2000 IU vitamin D3 daily during late pregnancy was effective in decreasing perinatal depression levels. We suggest further clinical trial in pregnant mothers who are at risk for postnatal depression. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials IRCT2015020310327N11 .

AIM: We aimed to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression symptom scores among individuals with clinically diagnosed major depression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic search of databases was carried out for published randomized controlled trials in English language, peer-reviewed journals from inception till August 2017. Outcome measure used for effect size calculation was depression symptom scores. Effect sizes for the trials were computed using standardized mean difference (Cohen's d), and I(2) test was used to assess sample heterogeneity. Pooled mean effect sizes were derived using both fixed and random-effects model. Critical appraisal of studies was done using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. RESULTS: A total of four trials involving 948 participants were included in the study. In three trials, the intervention group received oral vitamin D supplementation whereas in one parenteral vitamin D was given. Pooled mean effect size for vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptom ratings in major depression was 0.58 (95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.72). The I(2) value for heterogeneity was 0 suggesting low heterogeneity among studies. Egger plot intercept indicated minimal publication bias. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation favorably impacted depression ratings in major depression with a moderate effect size. These findings must be considered tentative owing to the limited number of trials available and inherent methodological bias noted in few of them.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vellekkatt F ; Menon V ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4103/jpgm.JPGM_571_17 ","Keywords":"Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\n*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin D/*therapeutic use\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/drug therapy\r\nVitamins/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive disorder\r\nmeta-analysis\r\nrandomized controlled trials\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vellekkatt F, and Menon V (2019) Efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in major depression: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials..

Our objective was to assess the efficacy of a single parenteral dose of vitamin D supplementation at baseline as an adjunct to treatment as usual on change in depression symptom ratings (primary outcome), quality of life and clinical severity of illness (secondary outcomes) at the end of 12 weeks when compared to treatment as usual in patients with major depression and concurrent Vitamin D deficiency. Eligible participants were randomized to receive either treatment as usual (TAU; n = 23) or TAU plus single parenteral dose of 3,00,000 IU of vitamin D (n = 23) at baseline. Rater-blinded assessments of depression (primary outcome), quality of life (QoL) and clinical severity of illness were obtained at baseline, and end of follow-up (12 weeks). Intent-to-treat analyses were performed on the entire randomized sample. The intervention significantly improved depression symptom ratings, quality of life and clinical severity of illness at the end of the treatment phase. These findings indicate that a single parenteral dose (3,00,000 IU) of adjunctive vitamin D replacement at baseline is an effective and well tolerated intervention in major depressive disorder with concurrent Vitamin D deficiency. Additionally, it points to a possible role for vitamin D in the pathophysiology of depression and supports personalized approaches for treatment of major depressive disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vellekkatt F ; Menon V ; Rajappa M ; Sahoo J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.07.037 ","Keywords":"*Depressive Disorder, Major/complications/drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nHumans\r\nQuality of Life\r\nVitamin D\r\n*Vitamin D Deficiency/complications/drug therapy\r\nAdjunctive treatment\r\nMajor depression\r\nNeuroinflammation\r\nQuality of life\r\nRandomized controlled trial\r\nVitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vellekkatt F, Menon V, Rajappa M, and Sahoo J (2020) Effect of adjunctive single dose parenteral Vitamin D supplementation in major depressive disorder with concurrent vitamin D deficiency: A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial..

METHODS: Forty-two female out-patients with moderate (with or without somatic syndrome) or severe depressive episodes (without psychotic symptoms) diagnosed as per ICD-10 criteria, were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either 20 mg fluoxetine and a relatively low dose folic acid (1.5 mg/day; n=23; Group I) or 20 mg fluoxetine and high dose folic acid (5 mg/day; n=19; Group II). Primary outcome measures were weekly changes of scores on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) for 6 weeks. RESULTS: Group II patients showed greater improvement in both HDRS [Mean (SD) baseline HDRS score=21 (2.3) for group I and 20.0 (1.4) for group-II; time X group interaction effect: p=0.01] and BDI [Mean (SD) baseline BDI score=25.1 (5.2) for group-1 and 23.1 (2.7) for group-II; time X group interaction effect: p=0.01]. With regard to HDRS, 7 (36.8%) group II patients remitted compared to 2 (8.7%) group I patients (p=0.03); 9 (47.4%) patients of group II responded when compared to 6 (26.1%) from group I (p=0.15). When BDI was considered, 5 (26.3%) group II patients remitted when compared to 2 (8.7%) from group I (p=0.13); 10 patients (52.6%) from group II responded when compared to 5 (21.7%) from group I (p=0.04). No adverse effects were noted in either group. LIMITATIONS: Lack of a placebo arm and small sample size.

However there are compelling reasons why 25(OH)D should preferably exceed 75 nmol/L: (A) Scrutiny of actual data specified by the IOM relating 25(OH)D to bone density and osteomalacia shows the desirable minimum 25(OH)D to be 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL). (B) Humans are primates, optimized through evolution to inhabit tropical latitudes, with serum 25(OH)D over 100 nmol/L. (C) Epidemiologic relationships show health benefits if 25(OH)D levels exceed 70 nmol/L; these include fewer falls, better tooth attachment, less colorectal cancer, improved depression and wellbeing. Some studies of populations at high-latitude relate higher 25(OH)D to risk of prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer or mortality. Those relationships are attributable to the dynamic fluctuations in 25(OH)D specific to high latitudes, and which can be corrected by maintaining 25(OH)D at steady, high levels throughout the year, the way they are in the tropics. (D) There are now many clinical trials that show benefits and/or no adversity with doses of vitamin D that raise serum 25(OH)D to levels beyond 75 nmol/L. Together, the evidence makes it very unlikely that further research will change the conclusion that risk of disease with serum 25(OH)D higher than 75 nmol/L is lower than the risk of disease if the serum 25(OH)D is approximately 53 nmol/L.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vieth R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.beem.2011.06.009 ","Keywords":"25-Hydroxyvitamin D 2/*blood\r\nAdult\r\nAnimals\r\nCalcifediol/*blood\r\nChild\r\nHumans\r\nNational Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, U.S., Health and \r\n      Medicine Division\r\nNutrition Policy\r\nPractice Guidelines as Topic\r\nUnited States\r\nVitamin D/administration & dosage\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/blood/diagnosis/physiopathology/*prevention & control","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vieth R (2011) Why the minimum desirable serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level should be 75 nmol/L (30 ng/ml)..

This has led to an interest in augmentation therapy for the management of treatment-resistant depression. OBJECTIVES: To assess (a) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SSRI/SNRI) adherence when augmented with second-generation atypical antipsychotics (SGAs) or L-methylfolate using a modified application of the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) acute medication management (AMM) measures at the time of augmentation, and (b) the depression-specific and total health care cost, comparing the 2 forms of augmentation therapy in the treatment of depressive disorder. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of depression and a pharmacy claim for an SSRI/SNRI between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2009 (index date), and receiving concomitant augmentation therapy with either an SGA or L-methylfolate (augmentation date), were identified in the MarketScan database and followed for 231 days (follow-up). Patients were excluded for having any pharmacy claim for an antidepressant or SGA 90 days pre-index; having an L-methylfolate claim 6 months pre-index; age < 18 years on the index date; or a diagnosis of pregnancy, dementia, psychotic-related mental disorders, Alzheimer's disease, or Parkinson's disease in the 12-month pre-index period. Propensity score matching (3:1 ratio, atypical antipsychotic to L-methylfolate) was used to select the final study cohorts, using covariates of age, gender, comorbidities, index SSRI/SNRI, and index SSRI/SNRI dose. Adherence to antidepressant therapy was measured from the augmentation date and included a modified application of the HEDIS (mHEDIS) AMM acute and chronic phase measures as well as the 6-month medication possession ratio. Health care utilization and cost were measured for the 6-month postaugmentation period and included both total as well as depression-related utilization/cost. Comparisons between the closely matched SGA and L-methylfolate-augmented cohorts were made using chi-square tests for binary measures and t-tests for continuous measures. RESULTS: Following propensity score matching, 4,053 SGA and 1,351 L-methylfolate patients were found to have augmentation of the index SSRI/SNRI within 12 months of the index date. The comparison groups were well matched on age, gender, comorbidities, and the type and dose of the SSRI/SNRI being augmented. The most common antidepressants augmented in both groups were escitalopram, duloxetine, and venlafaxine. Mean (standard deviation [SD]) time from index to augmentation was 73.5 [96.7] days for SGA and 105.9 [108.7] days for L-methylfolate (P < 0.001). The most common SGAs utilized for augmentation were quetiapine, aripiprazole, and risperidone. L-methylfolate was primarily dosed at 7.5 mg/day. The mHEDIS AMM acute phase measure was met by 68.7% of the SGA cohort and 78.7% of the L-methylfolate cohort (P < 0.001). The mHEDIS continuation phase measure was met by 50.3% of the SGA cohort and 62.1% of the L-methylfolate cohort (P < 0.001) following augmentation. Medical utilization (inpatient, emergency department, and outpatient) was significantly higher for the SGA group, while total prescription utilization was significantly higher in the L-methylfolate group. Mean [SD] total 6-month postaugmentation costs for the SGA group was $8,499 [$13,585] and $7,371 [$12,404] for the L-methylfolate group (P = 0.005), and 6-month depression-related costs were $2,688 [$4,201] for the SGA group and $1,613 [$2,315] for the L-methylfolate group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who augmented SSRI/SNRI therapy with SGA or L-methylfolate achieved mHEDIS AMM acute phase and continuation phase adherence scores of 69%-79% and 50%-62%, respectively. These modified scores exceeded the 2012 national median benchmarks for unmodified HEDIS AMM measures for commercial health plans. In this study, augmentation with L-methylfolate was associated with significantly higher adherence measures compared with augmentation with SGA. In addition, health care utilization and total health care costs, as well as depression-related costs, were significantly lower in the L-methylfolate augmentation group compared with augmentation with SGA.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wade RL ; Kindermann SL ; Hou Q ; Thase ME ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.18553/jmcp.2014.20.1.76 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/economics/*therapeutic use\r\nChemotherapy, Adjuvant/methods\r\nDatabases, Factual\r\nDelivery of Health Care/economics\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/economics\r\nDrug Resistance/drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nHealth Care Costs\r\nHealth Resources/*economics\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\n*Medication Adherence\r\nMedication Therapy Management/economics\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNorepinephrine/*antagonists & inhibitors\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nSerotonin Uptake Inhibitors/economics/*therapeutic use\r\nTetrahydrofolates/economics/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wade RL, Kindermann SL, Hou Q, and Thase ME (2014) Comparative assessment of adherence measures and resource use in SSRI/SNRI-treated patients with depression using second-generation antipsychotics or L-methylfolate as adjunctive therapy..

OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine whether oral FA + vitamin B-12 supplementation prevented cognitive decline in a cohort of community-dwelling older adults with elevated psychological distress. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a completely crossed 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design comprising daily oral 400 μg FA + 100 μg vitamin B-12 supplementation (compared with placebo), physical activity promotion, and depression literacy with comparator control interventions for reducing depressive symptoms was conducted in 900 adults aged 60-74 y with elevated psychological distress (Kessler Distress 10-Scale; scores >15). The 2-y intervention was delivered in 10 modules via mail with concurrent telephone tracking calls. Main outcome measures examined change in cognitive functioning at 12 and 24 mo by using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-Modified (TICS-M) and the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (processing speed); the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly was administered at 24 mo. RESULTS: FA + vitamin B-12 improved the TICS-M total (P = 0.032; effect size d = 0.17), TICS-M immediate (P = 0.046; d = 0.15), and TICS-M delayed recall (P = 0.013; effect size d = 0.18) scores at 24 mo in comparison with placebo. No significant changes were evident in orientation, attention, semantic memory, processing speed, or informant reports. CONCLUSION: Long-term supplementation of daily oral 400 μg FA + 100 μg vitamin B-12 promotes improvement in cognitive functioning after 24 mo, particularly in immediate and delayed memory performance.

Adolescence is a critical period for neural system development characterized by continuous brain maturation, especially in the prefrontal cortex. The etiology of these adolescent conditions may derive from fetal origin, probably attributed to the adverse effects induced by intrauterine environmental exposure. Anxiety- and depression-like behavior can be induced by gestational exposure to PM(2.5) in mice offspring which act as a useful model system. Recent studies show that B-vitamin may alleviate PM(2.5)-induced hippocampal neuroinflammation- and function-related spatial memory impairment in adolescent mice offspring. However, cortical damage and related neurobehavioral defects induced by gestational PM(2.5) exposure, as well as the potential reversibility by interventions in mice offspring require to be elucidated. Here, we aimed to investigate whether B-vitamin would protect mice offspring from the adverse effects derived from gestational exposure to urban PM(2.5) on cortical areas to which anxiety and depression are closely related. Pregnant mice were divided into three groups: control group (treated with PBS alone), model group (treated with both PM(2.5) and PBS), and intervention group (treated with both PM(2.5) and B-vitamin), respectively. The mice offspring were then applied to comprehensive neurobehavioral, ultrastructural, biochemical, and molecular biological analyses. Interestingly, we observed that gestational PM(2.5) exposure led to neurobehavioral defects including anxiety- and depression-like behavior. In addition, neuroinflammation, oxidative damage, increased apoptosis, and caspase-1-mediated inflammasome activation in the prefrontal cortex were observed. Notably, both behavioral and molecular changes could be significantly alleviated by B-vitamin treatment. In summary, our results suggest that the anxiety- and depression-like behavior induced by gestational PM(2.5) exposure in mice offspring can be ameliorated by B-vitamin supplementation, probably through the suppression of apoptosis, oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, and caspase-1-mediated inflammasome activation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wang X ; Wang T ; Sun L ; Zhang H ; Liu C ; Zhang C ; Yu L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.envpol.2020.115146 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Anxiety\r\n*Depression\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nMice\r\nParticulate Matter\r\nPregnancy\r\nVitamins\r\nB-Vitamin\r\nB-Vitamin ameliorates anxiety- and depression-like behavior induced by \r\n      gestational PM(2.5) exposure through suppressing neuroinflammation in the \r\n      prefrontal cortex\r\nDepression-like behavior\r\nNeuroinflammation\r\nPM(2.5)\r\nPrefrontal cortex","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wang X, Wang T, Sun L, Zhang H, Liu C, Zhang C, and Yu L (2020) B-vitamin supplementation ameliorates anxiety- and depression-like behavior induced by gestational urban PM(2.5) exposure through suppressing neuroinflammation in mice offspring..

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the impact of dietary folate intake on depressive symptoms in young Japanese women of reproductive age. METHODS: The study was conducted in Japan in 2009 with 141 Japanese women aged 18 to 28 years. A Japanese version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale was used to screen for depressive symptoms. Dietary intake was investigated by a diet history questionnaire. Nonfasting blood samples were collected from the women to measure folate and homocysteine levels. RESULTS: The proportion of women with lower folate intake (< 240 μg/d) was significantly higher in the women with CES-D scores greater than or equal to 19 when compared with the folate levels in those with CES-D scores less than 19 (75.0% vs 43.6%, respectively; P < .001). Logistic regression analysis revealed significant associations between CES-D scores greater than or equal to 19, low folate intake, and low vitamin B(6) intake when adjusted for age, living status, smoking, and body mass index. Adequate folate intake of more than the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) level of 240 μg per day was independently related to a decreased risk of depression (adjusted odds ratio 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.56; P < .001). DISCUSSION: Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed a reduced incidence of depression in women whose intake of folate exceeded the RDA of 240 μg per day. This finding suggests that dietary folate intake may be causally related to depressive symptoms in women of reproductive age. If results of studies powered to determine causal relationships are similarly positive, folate supplementation could reduce the incidence of depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Watanabe H ; Ishida S ; Konno Y ; Matsumoto M ; Nomachi S ; Masaki K ; Okayama H ; Nagai Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1542-2011.2011.00073.x ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/*etiology/prevention & control\r\n*Diet\r\nDiet Records\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/*administration & dosage\r\nFolic Acid Deficiency/*complications/epidemiology\r\nHumans\r\nIncidence\r\nJapan/epidemiology\r\nLogistic Models\r\n*Nutrition Assessment\r\nNutrition Policy\r\nOdds Ratio\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nVitamin B 6/*administration & dosage\r\nVitamin B Complex/*administration & dosage\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Watanabe H, Ishida S, Konno Y, Matsumoto M, Nomachi S, Masaki K, Okayama H, and Nagai Y (2012) Impact of dietary folate intake on depressive symptoms in young women of reproductive age..

Observational studies have found poor micronutrient status (particularly folate and vitamin B12) to be associated with an increased risk of depression in older people. Supplementation with folic acid has been shown to enhance anti-depressant drug treatment and there is preliminary evidence that supplementation with certain micronutrients may help improve depressive symptoms in older patients. There has also been a lot of interest in the role of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in depression. However, the evidence from randomized controlled trials is limited and difficult to evaluate owing to considerable variability between studies. The research highlights the importance of a healthy diet and lifestyle to help maintain good mental health into old age and health professionals should try to support older people in trying to achieve this.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Williamson C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.12968/bjcn.2009.14.10.44493 ","Keywords":"*Aged\r\nDeficiency Diseases/*complications/prevention & control\r\nDepression/epidemiology/*etiology/*prevention & control\r\nDiet/adverse effects\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDietetics/education\r\nExercise\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\n*Feeding Behavior\r\nFolic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nLife Style\r\nNutritional Status\r\nPatient Education as Topic\r\nRisk Factors\r\nVitamin B 12/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Williamson C (2009) Dietary factors and depression in older people..

If a serum cobalamin level of about 150 pmol/L (200 pg/mL) is considered normal, 10-15% of the elderly are deficient. Today, however, a threshold of 220-258 pmol/L (300-350 pg/mL) is recognized as desirable in the elderly, or else sensitive markers like the blood concentration of homocysteine or methylmalonic acid (MMA) are used. Then the prevalence of cobalamin deficiency rises to up to 43%. In the elderly, this high prevalence of poor cobalamin status is predominantly caused by atrophic gastritis type B. Atrophic gastritis results in declining gastric acid and pepsinogen secretion, and hence decreasing intestinal absorption of the cobalamin protein complexes from food. About 20-50% of the elderly are affected. Furthermore, the reduced acid secretion leads to an alkalinization of the small intestine, which may result in bacterial overgrowth and thus to a further decrease of the bioavailability of the vitamin. In addition, some drugs such as proton pump inhibitors or H2 receptor antagonists inhibit the intestinal absorption of vitamin B(12). An already moderately reduced vitamin B(12) level is associated with vascular disease and neurocognitive disorders such as depression and impaired cognitive performance. Furthermore, a poor vitamin B(12) status is assumed to be involved in the development and progression of dementia (e.g., Alzheimer's dementia). This is especially observable if the folic acid status is reduced as well. Due to the insecure supply, the cobalamin status of elderly persons (>/=60 years) should be regularly controlled and a general supplementation with vitamin B(12) (>50 microg/day) should be considered.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wolters M ; Ströhle A ; Hahn A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ypmed.2004.04.047 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nBlood Platelets/metabolism\r\nHemostasis/physiology\r\nHumans\r\nModels, Biological\r\nOxidative Stress\r\nSignal Transduction\r\nVitamin B 12/administration & dosage/blood/*metabolism\r\nVitamin B 12 Deficiency/*diagnosis/drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wolters M, Ströhle A, and Hahn A (2004) Cobalamin: a critical vitamin in the elderly..

It incurs significant healthcare costs if left untreated. Even though intervention with antidepressants can reduce depressive symptoms, side effects are often an issue and relapse is very common. Vitamin D, commonly known as the sunshine vitamin, is an essential fat-soluble vitamin for the absorption of calcium to prevent rickets (children) and osteomalacia (adults). Evidence on a possible relationship between vitamin D deficiency and depression is growing. In this review, the authors summarized the evidence on the association between vitamin D status and depression in human observational studies, followed by clinical trials to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation in treating depression. In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency may be associated with an increased risk or severity of depression. Supplementation of vitamin D may confer protection for depressed patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wong SK ; Chin KY ; Ima-Nirwana S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1389450118666170913161030 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnimals\r\nCalcium/metabolism\r\nChild\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/etiology/physiopathology\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\nQuality of Life\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nVitamin D/*administration & dosage/blood\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/*complications/drug therapy\r\n1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D\r\n25-hydroxyvitamin D\r\ndepression\r\nmental health\r\nvitamin D.","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wong SK, Chin KY, and Ima-Nirwana S (2018) Vitamin D and Depression: The Evidence from an Indirect Clue to Treatment Strategy..

Elderly people are at risk of under nutrition, and also have higher prevalence of cognitive impairment and depression. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between nutrient intake and psychological health in the elderly, adjusting for confounding factors. SUBJECTS: Three thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine men and women aged 65 years and over living in the community, with approximately equal numbers in three age groups: 65-69, 70-74, 75+ years. METHODS: Dietary intake was assessed using a 7-day food frequency questionnaire. Cognitive function was assessed by the cognitive part of the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia (CSID). Depression was assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Information was also collected for confounding factors: demographics, educational level, socioeconomic status, medical history, smoking, alcohol intake, and physical activity. Logistic regression analyses were carried out to examine associations between lifestyle and dietary variables, and CSID and GDS, controlling for confounders. RESULTS: Both CSID and GDS scores were associated with co-morbidity, demographic and socioeconomic factors. Few associations between lifestyle factors and CSID score were observed. Dietary factors inversely associated with GDS score include total fat intake, vitamins A, B2, B3, C, fibre, and vegetables. In terms of nutrient density, iron and isoflavone intake were additional factors. CONCLUSION: Association exists between intake of various nutrients and psychological health independent of other confounding factors in the elderly population. A follow-up study of this cohort or interventional studies are needed to elucidate cause effect relationship.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Woo J ; Lynn H ; Lau WY ; Leung J ; Lau E ; Wong SY ; Kwok T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/gps.1603 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nCognition Disorders/*diagnosis/epidemiology/ethnology\r\nComorbidity\r\nDepression/*diagnosis/epidemiology/ethnology\r\nFemale\r\nHong Kong/epidemiology/ethnology\r\nHumans\r\nLife Style\r\nLogistic Models\r\nMale\r\n*Nutritional Status/ethnology\r\nSocioeconomic Factors\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Woo J, Lynn H, Lau WY, Leung J, Lau E, Wong SY, and Kwok T (2006) Nutrient intake and psychological health in an elderly Chinese population..

However, few studies have examined this relation in poor urban settings. Our brief review suggests that (a) higher overall diet quality may play a particularly important role in cognitive function among the poorest; and (b) greater vitamin E intake is related to better cognitive performance, at least in part, via fewer depressive symptoms. The broader recent literature strongly suggests the beneficial role of diet for learning and memory, and potentially synergistic influences on other cognitive domains. However, adherence to healthful diet among urban poor may be limited by factors such as cost and access. Here, we propose several potential moderators and mediators of diet-cognition relations among urban poor. Future studies should focus on the complex interplay among factors that influence the role of diet in cognitive function among poor, urban-dwelling persons.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wright RS ; Gerassimakis C ; Bygrave D ; Waldstein SR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s13668-017-0186-x ","Keywords":"cognitive function\r\ndiet quality\r\ndietary factors\r\ndietary patterns\r\npoor\r\nsocioeconomic status\r\nurban setting","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wright RS, Gerassimakis C, Bygrave D, and Waldstein SR (2017) Dietary Factors and Cognitive Function in Poor Urban Settings..

Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the association between depressive symptoms and supplemental intake. RESULTS: When compared to the non-supplementation group, the Ca group exhibited a significant odds ratio (OR) of 0.731 (95% CI: 0.552-0.967, P=0.028). After adjusting for age, sex, and Ca food sources, the OR was even smaller for the CaD group (OR: 0.326; 95% CI: 0.119-0.889, P=0.029). Additionally, our results indicated that taking Ca supplements ≥4 days/week yielded a significant OR of 0.690 (95% CI: 0.492-0.968) after full adjustment. Taking CaD supplements ≥4 days/week yielded a significant OR of 0.282 (95% CI: 0.089-0.898) after adjusting for age, sex, and Ca food sources. CONCLUSIONS: Supplemental intake of Ca or CaD ≥4 days/week can decrease the risk of depressive symptoms in older adults, although CaD supplements may be more effective.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wu MN ; He F ; Tang QR ; Chen J ; Gu X ; Zhai YJ ; Li FD ; Zhang T ; Wang XY ; Lin JF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s12603-019-1278-7 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nCalcium/*administration & dosage\r\nCalcium, Dietary/*analysis\r\nDepression/*diet therapy/psychology\r\nDietary Supplements/*analysis\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nProspective Studies\r\nVitamin D/*administration & dosage\r\nVitamin D Deficiency/physiopathology\r\nCalcium\r\ndepressive symptoms\r\nolder adults\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wu MN, He F, Tang QR, Chen J, Gu X, Zhai YJ, Li FD, Zhang T, Wang XY, and Lin JF (2020) Association between Depressive Symptoms and Supplemental intake of Calcium and Vitamin D in Older Adults..

We used the Logistic regression models to analyze the associations of the dietary intakes of B vitamins with the risk of depression. Results: 17,732 individuals (8,623 males and 9,109 females) were enrolled in the study and they were all 18 or older. Compared to the lowest quartile of dietary intake, the ORs (95%CIs) of the highest quartile were 0.64 (0.50-0.82), 0.78 (0.62-0.97), 0.60 (0.47-0.78), 0.65 (0.50-0.84), and 0.71 (0.54-0.95) for vitamin B1, vitamin B2, niacin, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12, respectively. Compared to the people whose dietary intakes below the RDA in the model 2, those with intake meeting the RDA of vitamin B1 (OR: 0.68; 95%CI: 0.56-0.84), niacin (OR: 0.65; 95%CI: 0.51-0.81), B6 (OR: 0.65; 95%CI: 0.52-0.81), or B12 (OR: 0.65; 95%CI: 0.48-0.88) had a lower risk of depression, severally. We also found a nonlinear negative association between dietary vitamin B1, vitamin B2, niacin, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 intakes and the risk of depression in the dose-response analyses, severally.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize the existing evidence and synthesize the results. DATA SOURCES: The databases of Web of Science and PubMed were searched for relevant articles published in English until September 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies that evaluated the associations between depression and dietary vitamin B1, B2, B6, and B12 were included in this study. DATA EXTRACTION: The job of data extraction was undertaken by 2 authors, and the pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a fixed-effects model. RESULTS: Thirteen articles related to 18 studies were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled RR (95% CI) of depression for the highest vs the lowest category of dietary vitamin B1, B2, B6, and B12 was 0.69 (0.55-0.87), 0.77 (0.67-0.89), 0.81 (0.71-0.93), and 0.86 (0.75-0.99), respectively. The pooled RR (95% CI) of depression for the highest vs the lowest category of dietary vitamin B2 was 0.80 (0.64-0.99) in females and 0.83 (0.67-1.02) in males, for dietary vitamin B6 was 0.71 (0.59-0.86) in females and 0.92 (0.76-1.12) in males, and for dietary vitamin B12 was 0.79 (0.65-0.97) in females and 0.94 (0.77-1.15) in males. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that the intake of dietary vitamin B1, B2, B6, and B12 may be inversely associated with the risk of depression; the inverse associations observed between depression and intake of dietary vitamin B2, B6, and B12 were significant in females, but not in males.

METHODS: 39168 elderly adults (age≥60 years) who had valid estimates on exposure of PM(2.5) in 2010 and data on major depressive disorder were extracted from the UK Biobank. Major depressive disorder was assessed by lifetime experience of mild, moderate, and severe major depression with validated instruments. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between PM(2.5) exposure and major depressive disorder. RESULTS: A total of 9079 participants had major depressive disorder, with a prevalence of 23.2%. The odds ratio (OR) of major depressive disorder was 1.096 (1.023, 1.175) for participants in the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile of PM(2.5). The correlation of PM(2.5) with major depressive disorder generally increased with the decreasing levels of vitamin D. For instance, in participants with the highest quartile of PM(2.5), the corresponding ORs were 1.141 (0.951, 1.369), 1.232 (1.027, 1.478), 1.286 (1.072, 1.543), and 1.390 (1.159, 1.667) for those who had adequate, desirable, insufficient, and deficient levels of vitamin D, respectively. Additionally, significant modification effects of physical activity on the relationship between PM(2.5) and major depressive disorder were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that high levels of vitamin D and physical activity may attenuate the relationship between PM(2.5) and major depressive disorder among elderly adults.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wu M ; Xie J ; Zhou Z ; Wang L ; Hu Y ; Sun Y ; Wang Y ; Tian Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2021.12.009 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\n*Air Pollutants/analysis\r\n*Air Pollution/analysis\r\nBiological Specimen Banks\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/epidemiology\r\nEnvironmental Exposure\r\nExercise\r\nHumans\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nParticulate Matter/adverse effects/analysis\r\nUnited Kingdom/epidemiology\r\nVitamin D\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nPM(2.5)\r\nPhysical activity\r\nVitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wu M, Xie J, Zhou Z, Wang L, Hu Y, Sun Y, Wang Y, and Tian Y (2022) Fine particulate matter, vitamin D, physical activity, and major depressive disorder in elderly adults: Results from UK Biobank..

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and the incidence and prognosis of depression and to analyze the latent effects of subgroups including population and supplement strategy. METHODS: A systematic search for articles before July 2021 in databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) was conducted to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the incidence and prognosis of depression. RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 29 studies with 4,504 participants, indicating that the use of vitamin D was beneficial to a decline in the incidence of depression (SMD: -0.23) and improvement of depression treatment (SMD: -0.92). Subgroup analysis revealed that people with low vitamin D levels (<50 nmol/L) and females could notably benefit from vitamin D in both prevention and treatment of depression. The effects of vitamin D with a daily supplementary dose of >2,800 IU and intervention duration of ≥8 weeks were considered significant in both prevention and treatment analyses. Intervention duration ≤8 weeks was recognized as effective in the treatment group. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that vitamin D has a beneficial impact on both the incidence and the prognosis of depression. Whether suffering from depression or not, individuals with low vitamin D levels, dose >2,800 IU, intervention duration ≥8 weeks, and all females are most likely to benefit from vitamin D supplementation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Xie F ; Huang T ; Lou D ; Fu R ; Ni C ; Hong J ; Ruan L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fpubh.2022.903547 ","Keywords":"*Depression/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIncidence\r\nPrognosis\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nVitamin D/therapeutic use\r\n*Vitamins/therapeutic use\r\ndepression\r\nincidence\r\nmeta-analysis\r\nprognosis\r\nvitamin D supplementation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Xie F, Huang T, Lou D, Fu R, Ni C, Hong J, and Ruan L (2022) Effect of vitamin D supplementation on the incidence and prognosis of depression: An updated meta-analysis based on randomized controlled trials..

Although several risk factors associated with depression have been identified, the cause of depression is still not clear. Several studies have demonstrated that physical activity and nutrient intake, such as increased levels of B vitamins in serum, decrease symptoms of depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between physical activity and dietary intake of vitamins B₆, B₉, and B₁₂ and symptoms of depression among postgraduate students. The results of this study suggest that intake of vitamin B9 may modulate the total score of Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and two subscales of the CES-D including depressive affect and interpersonal difficulties. This study also showed that moderate/high levels of physical activity were inversely and significantly associated with symptoms of depression (total scores) and three subscales of the CES-D including depressive affect, positive affect, and somatic complaints.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yary T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1155/2013/582693 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDepression/diet therapy/*metabolism/physiopathology/psychology\r\nFemale\r\nFolic Acid/administration & dosage/*metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nIran\r\nMale\r\n*Motor Activity\r\nStudents/psychology\r\nVitamin B Complex/blood","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yary T (2013) The association between dietary intake of folate and physical activity with psychological dimensions of depressive symptoms among students from Iran..

METHOD: This 2 × 2 factorial, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with obese/overweight patients with depressive symptoms was conducted in the Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Center (EMRC), Vali-Asr, Emam Khomeini Hospital between July 2016 and February 2017. The intervention period was 12 wk. There were 140 randomized participants who were obese or overweight (mean ± SD, 38.35± 6.70 y of age; mean ± SD body mass index, 30.1 ± 3.78 kg/m(2)) with BDI ≥ 10. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio: 2000 IU/d vitamin D + zinc placebo; 30 mg/d zinc gluconate + vitamin D placebo; 2000 IU/d vitamin D + 30 mg/d zinc gluconate; or vitamin D placebo + zinc placebo for 12 wk. RESULTS: We analyzed 125 participants, and a significant decrease in BDI-II was found among those who received zinc, vitamin D, or joint zinc-vitamin D supplements compared with the placebo group (P < 0.001). Zinc was significantly more effective than vitamin D on decreasing the depression score. Supplementation with zinc, vitamin D, or a combination of the two had no significant effects on serum cortisol (P = 0.974) or BDNF (P = 0.076). Fifteen patients discontinued participation owing to pregnancy (n = 1), severe anemia (n = 1), and unspecified unwillingness to continue (n = 13).

METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, ISI web of science and Scopus databases was conducted, from inception to 1 March 2020. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to estimate the effect size (as Hedge's g) of vitamin C supplementation on depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Finding from 10 trials with 836 participants revealed no significant improvement in mood status in overall analysis (n = 10, Hedge's g = 0.09; 95% confidence interval: -0.15 to 0.33; P = 0.465). However, subgroup analysis showed beneficial effects of vitamin C supplementation in patients who were not prescribed antidepressants (subclinical depressed) (n = 5, Hedge's g: -0.18; 95% CI: -0.35, -0.01, P = 0.041; I(2) = 0.00%,). CONCLUSIONS: Although no significant effect on mood status was observed in overall population, this meta-analysis tentatively suggests that vitamin C may produce mood-elevating effects in patients with subclinical depression.

The incidence of folic acid deficiency is high in patients with various psychiatric disorders including depression, dementia and schizophrenia. 2. In epileptics on anticonvulsants, folate deficiency often occurs because anticonvulsants inhibit folate absorption. In these patients folate deficiency is often associated with psychiatric symptoms. 3. In medical patients psychiatric symptoms occur more frequently, and in psychiatric patients symptoms are more severe, in those with folate deficiency than in those with normal levels. 4. Many open studies have demonstrated therapeutic effects of folate administration on psychiatric symptoms in folate deficient patients. 5. Several placebo-controlled studies have not demonstrated therapeutic effects, possibly because the doses they used (15-20 mg/day) are known to be toxic and to cause mental symptoms. 6. Two placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of folic acid administration, one in patients with a syndrome of psychiatric and neuropsychological changes associated with folate deficiency and the other in patients on long-term lithium therapy. In the latter study the dose was only 0.2 mg/day. 7. Folic acid deficiency is known to lower brain S-adenosylmethionine and 5-hydroxytryptamine. S-Adenosylmethionine, which has antidepressant properties, raises brain 5-hydroxytryptamine. Thus, depression associated with folate deficiency is probably related to low brain 5HT. 8. S-Adenosylmethionine is involved in many methylation reactions, including methylation of membrane phospholipids, which influences membrane properties. This may explain the wide variety of symptoms associated with folate deficiency. 9. Because the costs and risks associated with low doses of folic acid (up to 0.5 mg/day) are small, folic acid should be given as an adjunct in the treatment of patients with unipolar or bipolar affective disorders and anorexia, epileptics on anticonvulsants, geriatric patients with mental symptoms and patients with gastrointestinal disorders who exhibit psychiatric symptoms. 10. Although the majority of the patients listed above will probably not be helped by folic acid therapy, a significant minority are likely to have folate-responsive symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Young SN ; Ghadirian AM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/0278-5846(89)90037-7 ","Keywords":"Folic Acid/*physiology\r\nFolic Acid Deficiency/metabolism/*psychology\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/metabolism/*physiopathology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Young SN, and Ghadirian AM (1989) Folic acid and psychopathology..

We investigated 3 models of niacin deficiency: niacin deficient (ND) vs. pair fed (PF), ND vs. partially feed restricted (PFR), and ND vs. niacin recovered (REC). ND rats showed an improvement in spatial learning ability relative to PF, PFR, and REC rats. ND rats also showed a decrease in both NAD(+) and cADPR relative to PF and REC rats. We also investigated 1 model of pharmacological supplementation, niacin-supplemented vs. control. The niacin-supplemented group showed a small but significant spatial learning impairment relative to controls, and an increase in brain cADPR and NAD(+).

METHOD: Subjects in this analysis were adult outpatients (18-65 years) enrolled from 2 acute, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials comparing adjunctive L-methylfolate and placebo for DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD) with an inadequate response to monotherapy selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Subjects who completed the acute trial were offered to enroll in a 12-month, open-label treatment phase with L-methylfolate and continued SSRI treatment, with scheduled visits for efficacy, safety, and tolerability every 12 weeks. Subjects were enrolled between September 2006 and February 2010. Efficacy outcomes included predefined criteria for response, remission, recovery, relapse, and recurrence. Subjects treated with adjunctive L-methylfolate 15 mg were included in the efficacy analysis. RESULTS: Of 68 subjects who met criteria for the 12-month open-label phase, 38% (n = 26) achieved full recovery, and none experienced a recurrence of MDD. For subjects entering the open-label phase in remission (n = 11), 91% (n = 10) achieved full recovery with L-methylfolate 15 mg, and none experienced a relapse or recurrence. Among 57 subjects who entered the open-label phase as nonremitted, 61% (n = 35) achieved remission.

Therefore, it is important to develop effective and safe interventions to mitigate the burden of anxiety and depression disorders in this population. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the anxiety and depression status of elderly people with prediabetes. Participants were randomly assigned a weekly dose of vitamin D(3) of 25,000 IU (n = 45, mean age 73.10 ± 7.16 years) or nothing (n = 45, mean age 74.03 ± 7.64 years), in addition to suggested lifestyle measures. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory subscales (STAI-T and STAI-S) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were used to evaluate anxiety and depression levels, respectively, at baseline, 6, and 12 months. A total of 92.68% of the participants in the vitamin D group and 97.14% of the controls exhibited vitamin D deficiency (&lt;20 ng/mL) at baseline. Mean STAI-T scores were lower in supplemented individuals than in the control group at 6 (38.02 ± 9.03 vs. 43.91 ± 7.18, p = 0.003) and 12 months (32.35 ± 7.77 vs. 44.97 ± 7.78, p &lt; 0.001). The same pattern was evident for STAI-S scores at 6 (37.11 ± 7.88 vs. 43.20 ± 9.33, p = 0.003) and 12 months (32.59 ± 6.45 vs. 44.60 ± 9.53, p &lt; 0.001). Supplemented participants demonstrated lower mean PHQ-9 scores compared to controls at 6 (15.69 ± 6.15 vs. 19.77 ± 8.96, p = 0.021) and 12 months (13.52 ± 5.01 vs. 20.20 ± 8.67, p &lt; 0.001). Participants with deficiency and insufficiency at baseline experienced equal benefits of supplementation in terms of anxiety and depression scores. In conclusion, in a high-risk population, a weekly vitamin D supplementation scheme was effective in alleviating anxiety and depression symptoms. More studies are needed to elucidate the relevant mechanisms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zaromytidou E ; Koufakis T ; Dimakopoulos G ; Drivakou D ; Konstantinidou S ; Rakitzi P ; Grammatiki M ; Manthou E ; Notopoulos A ; Iakovou I ; Gotzamani-Psarrakou A ; Kotsa K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/metabo12100884 ","Keywords":"anxiety\r\ndepression\r\nelderly\r\nprediabetes\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zaromytidou E, Koufakis T, Dimakopoulos G, Drivakou D, Konstantinidou S, Rakitzi P, Grammatiki M, Manthou E, Notopoulos A, Iakovou I, Gotzamani-Psarrakou A, and Kotsa K (2022) Vitamin D Alleviates Anxiety and Depression in Elderly People with Prediabetes: A Randomized Controlled Study..

Vitamin D as a neuro-steroid hormone might play a role in the onset and treatment of depression. In the present study, the association between depressive symptoms and vitamin D concentration in serum was evaluated. 140 patients of a psychogeriatric day-care unit were included. The geriatric depression scale (GDS) and the Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) were assessed at the beginning and end of treatment, GDS scores additionally 6 weeks after discharge from the day-care unit. Vitamin D levels were measured at the beginning of the treatment, routinely. Patients with levels below 30 µg/L were treated with 1000 IU vitamin D per day. There was no association between the severity of depressive symptoms and the concentration of vitamin D at the beginning of the treatment. Patients with higher vitamin D levels showed a stronger decline of depressive symptoms measured by the GDS during their stay in the day-care unit. We provide evidence that vitamin D serum levels might influence antidepressant therapy response in a geriatric population. Prospective studies are necessary to determine which patients may profit from add-on vitamin D therapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zech LD ; Scherf-Clavel M ; Daniels C ; Schwab M ; Deckert J ; Unterecker S ; Herr AS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00702-021-02385-1 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\n*Depression/drug therapy\r\nGeriatric Psychiatry\r\nHumans\r\nProspective Studies\r\nQuality of Life\r\nSelf Report\r\n*Vitamin D\r\nAnti-depressive treatment\r\nDepression\r\nPsycho-geriatrics\r\nVitamin D deficiency","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zech LD, Scherf-Clavel M, Daniels C, Schwab M, Deckert J, Unterecker S, and Herr AS (2021) Patients with higher vitamin D levels show stronger improvement of self-reported depressive symptoms in psychogeriatric day-care setting..

However, the unsafety of ERT hinders its clinical use. In this study, we would evaluate whether vitamin D (VD), a hormone with optimal safety profile, could relieve the depressive-like symptom in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Furthermore, we would determine whether vitamin D and 17β-estradiol (E2) exert neurological function through their immunomodulatory effect in OVX rats. Middle-aged female SD rats were randomly divided into four groups, namely, control (SHAM), OVX, OVX + VD, and OVX + E2. Vitamin D (calcitriol, 100 ng/kg) and 17β-estradiol (30 μg/kg) had been daily gavaged in the OVX + VD and OVX + E2 group, respectively. After 10-week administration, vitamin D and 17β-estradiol both showed anti-depressive-like activity in the OVX rats. Using the method of immunofluorescent staining and western blot, vitamin D and 17β-estradiol were demonstrated to upregulate each other's receptors, including VDR, ERα, and ERβ in the hippocampus of OVX rats. Additionally, the upregulation of VDR, calbindin-D28k, and calbindin-D9k suggested that the vitamin D signaling system was amplified by vitamin D and 17β-estradiol. Vitamin D and 17β-estradiol showed neuroprotective effects by decreasing OVX-induced apoptosis and neuronal damage, regulating the AMPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, and reducing the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα), as well as iNOS and COX-2 in the hippocampus of OVX rats. Collectively, the present study demonstrated that vitamin D and 17β-estradiol could upregulate each other's receptors and regulate the AMPK/NF-κB pathway to relieve the OVX-induced depressive-like state. The results could stimulate translational research towards the vitamin D potential for prevention or treatment of menopause-related depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zhang WY ; Guo YJ ; Wang KY ; Chen LM ; Jiang P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106734 ","Keywords":"Adenylate Kinase/metabolism\r\nAnimals\r\nCells, Cultured\r\nDepression\r\nEstradiol/*metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nNF-kappa B/metabolism\r\nNeurogenic Inflammation/*immunology\r\nNeuroprotective Agents\r\nOvariectomy\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSignal Transduction\r\nVitamin D/*metabolism\r\n17β-Estradiol\r\nDepression\r\nNeuroinflammation\r\nOvariectomy\r\nVitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zhang WY, Guo YJ, Wang KY, Chen LM, and Jiang P (2020) Neuroprotective effects of vitamin D and 17ß-estradiol against ovariectomy-induced neuroinflammation and depressive-like state: Role of the AMPK/NF-κB pathway..

The occurrence of emotional and cognitive dysfunction is common in postpartum women, and its treatment remains limited. Considering the promising results of FA in various psychiatric disorders both in human and redents, we tested the effect of gestational FA administration on postpartum psychiatric behavioral phenotypes and the implicated brain-related mechanisms in a murine model. FA was administered orally in both the hormone-stimulated-pregnancy (HSP) model and pregnant mice at doses of 1 and 5 mg/kg. Postpartum behavioral results showed that the disorders of cognitive performance, depressive, and anxiety-related behaviors were all alleviated in the 5 mg/kg FA group. However, the general development of their offspring remained unaffected. Immunofluorescence and immunoblot results revealed that FA pretreatment significantly activated the maternal hippocampal BDNF-related pathway. Morphological studies have confirmed that FA promotes hippocampal neurogenesis. Moreover, synaptic plasticity and synaptic transmission are enhanced. All of these hippocampal changes play critical roles in rescuing neuronal function and behaviors. Thus, our data suggest that gestational FA administration has a therapeutic effect that improves cognition and reduces depression and anxiety in a murine postpartum model. This may be developed as a preventive and adjuvant therapeutic option for pregnant women.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zhang Q ; Huang Q ; Yao L ; Liu W ; Ruan J ; Nong Y ; Chen Y ; Fan L ; Wei J ; Wang S ; Sun L ; Li H ; Zhang Y ; Zhang X ; Liu F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fphar.2021.701009 ","Keywords":"behavior\r\nbrain-derived neurotrophic factor\r\nfolic acid\r\nhippocampus\r\npostpartum","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zhang Q, Huang Q, Yao L, Liu W, Ruan J, Nong Y, Chen Y, Fan L, Wei J, Wang S, Sun L, Li H, Zhang Y, Zhang X, and Liu F (2021) Gestational Folic Acid Administration Alleviated Maternal Postpartum Emotional and Cognitive Dysfunction in Mice..

METHODS: An extensive literature search on February 2022 (PubMed, Web of Science and Embase) was employed to identify observational studies on the associations of dietary vitamin A and beta-carotene intake with depression. The pooled relative risk (RR) of depression for the highest vs. lowest dietary vitamin A and beta-carotene intake category, and the standard mean difference (SMD) of dietary vitamin A and beta-carotene intake for depression vs. control subjects, were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 25 observational studies (100,955 participants), which included 24 cross-sectional/case-control and 1 prospective cohort study, were included in this study. The overall multi-variable adjusted RR demonstrated that dietary vitamin A intake was inversely associated with depression (RR = 0.83, 95%CI: 0.70-1.00; P = 0.05). In addition, the combined SMD showed that the dietary vitamin A intake in depression was also lower than that in control subjects (SMD = -0.13, 95%CI: -0.18 to -0.07; P < 0.001). On the other hand, the overall multi-variable adjusted RR indicated that dietary beta-carotene intake was negatively associated with depression (RR = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.55-0.72; P < 0.001). The combined SMD showed that the dietary beta-carotene intake in depression was also lower than that in control subjects (SMD = -0.34, 95%CI: -0.48 to -0.20; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that both dietary vitamin A and beta-carotene intake is inversely associated with depression.

This study aimed to evaluate the antidepressant-like effects of MNA in mice, and the possible antidepressant mechanism was also determined. The forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression, western blotting method and K252a (a pharmacological inhibitor of the BDNF receptor) were used together in the present study. It was found that a single injection of MNA (100 and 200 mg/kg) displayed notable antidepressant-like potential in the FST and TST without affecting the locomotor activity of mice. Repeated administration of MNA (100 and 200 mg/kg) for 2 weeks fully reversed not only the CUMS-induced depressive-like symptoms in mice but also the CUMS-induced decrease in the hippocampal BDNF signaling pathway. Furthermore, the usage of K252a fully blocked the antidepressant-like effects of MNA in the FST, TST and CUMS model of depression. Collectively, MNA possess an antidepressant-like effect in mice which is mediated, at least in part, through promoting the hippocampal BDNF signaling pathway.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zhao J ; Zhang Y ; Liu Y ; Tang WQ ; Ji CH ; Gu JH ; Jiang B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neulet.2020.135535 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nChronic Disease\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/metabolism/psychology\r\n*Disease Models, Animal\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nHindlimb Suspension/adverse effects\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nNiacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use\r\nStress, Psychological/*drug therapy/metabolism/psychology\r\n1-Methylnicotinamide\r\nBrain-derived neurotrophic factor\r\nChronic unpredictable mild stress\r\nDepression\r\nHippocampus","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zhao J, Zhang Y, Liu Y, Tang WQ, Ji CH, Gu JH, and Jiang B (2021) Antidepressant-like effects of 1-methylnicotinamide in a chronic unpredictable mild stress model of depression..

Several glia-targeted agents are required to protect neonates. Folic acid (FA), a clinical medication used during pregnancy, has been reported to have neuroprotective properties. However, the effects and mechanisms of FA in PIA-induced neonatal encephalitis and mood disorders remain unclear. Here, we investigated the roles of FA in a mouse model of PIA, and found that FA treatment improved depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in adults, accompanied by a decrease in the number of activated microglia and astrocytes, as well as a reduction in the inflammatory response in the cortex and hippocampus of neonatal mice. Furthermore, we offer new evidence describing the functional differences in FA between microglia and astrocytes. Our data show that epigenetic regulation plays an essential role in FA-treated glial cells following PIA stimulation. In astrocytes, FA promoted the expression of IL-10 by decreasing the level of EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 at its promoter, whereas FA promoted the expression of IL-13 by reducing the promoter binding of H3K9me3 mediated by KDM4A in microglia. Importantly, FA specifically regulated the expression level of BDNF in astrocytes through H3K27me3. Overall, our data supported that FA may be an effective treatment for reducing mood disorders induced by PIA, and we also demonstrated significant functional differences in FA between the two cell types following PIA stimulation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zhao T ; Wu D ; Du J ; Liu G ; Ji G ; Wang Z ; Peng F ; Man L ; Zhou W ; Hao A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fphar.2022.818423 ","Keywords":"anxiety\r\ndepression\r\nepigenetics\r\nfolic acid\r\nglial cells\r\npostnatal immune infection","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zhao T, Wu D, Du J, Liu G, Ji G, Wang Z, Peng F, Man L, Zhou W, and Hao A (2022) Folic Acid Attenuates Glial Activation in Neonatal Mice and Improves Adult Mood Disorders Through Epigenetic Regulation..

DESIGN: A prespecified secondary analysis of a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive oral vitamin D(3) (50,000 IU, n = 209) or placebo (n = 204) monthly for 24 months. In addition, participants who completed the trial were classified into 2 groups according to their serum 25(OH)D levels at month 3 and 24 as follows: not consistently sufficient (serum 25(OH)D ≤ 50 nmol/L at month 3 and/or 24), and consistently sufficient (serum 25(OH)D > 50 nmol/L at both month 3 and 24). Multilevel mixed-effect models were used to compare differences of change in PHQ-9 scores between groups. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This clinical trial was conducted in participants with symptomatic knee OA and vitamin D deficiency from June 2010 to December 2013 in Tasmania and Victoria, Australia. MEASURES: The primary outcome was the depressive symptoms change over 24 months, which was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9, 0-27). RESULTS: Of 599 participants who were screened for eligibility, 413 participants were enrolled (mean age: 63.2 years; 50.3% female) and 340 participants (intervention n = 181, placebo n = 159, 82.3% retention rate) completed the study. The baseline prevalence of depression (PHQ-9 score ≥5) was 25.4%. Depressive symptoms improved more in the vitamin D supplementation group compared to the placebo group [β: -0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.22 to -0.11, P for difference = .02] and in the participants who maintained vitamin D sufficiency compared to those who did not (β: -0.73, 95% CI: -1.41 to -0.05, P for difference = .04) over 24 months. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: These findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation and maintaining adequate vitamin D levels over 24 months may be beneficial for depressive symptoms in patients with knee OA.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zheng S ; Tu L ; Cicuttini F ; Han W ; Zhu Z ; Antony B ; Wluka A ; Winzenberg T ; Meng T ; Aitken D ; Blizzard L ; Jones G ; Ding C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jamda.2018.09.006 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAustralia/epidemiology\r\nDepression/epidemiology/*physiopathology\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOsteoarthritis, Knee/*psychology\r\nPrevalence\r\nSelf Report\r\nVitamin D/*administration & dosage\r\nVitamin D Deficiency\r\nVitamins/*administration & dosage\r\nVitamin D supplementation\r\ndepressive symptoms\r\nosteoarthritis\r\nvitamin D deficiency","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zheng S, Tu L, Cicuttini F, Han W, Zhu Z, Antony B, Wluka A, Winzenberg T, Meng T, Aitken D, Blizzard L, Jones G, and Ding C (2019) Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Depressive Symptoms in Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis..

METHODS: Review Manager Program Version 5.3 was used to analyze data. RESULTS: Fourteen studies with 16 RCTs (n = 1,520) on folate for schizophrenia (4 RCTs, n = 210), mood disorders (i.e., unipolar and bipolar depression) (1 RCT, n = 60), bipolar disorder (2 RCTs, n = 189) and MDD (9 RCTs, n = 1,061) were analyzed separately by diagnosis. For schizophrenia, adjunctive folate was not superior to placebo in terms of total psychopathology (standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.14, 95% confidential interval (CI): -0.67, 0.39; I(2) = 30%, P = 0.60), and positive (SMD = 0.09, 95% CI: -0.44, 0.62; I(2) = not applicable, P = 0.74), negative (SMD = -0.39, 95% CI:-0.84, 0.05; I(2) = 50%, P = 0.08), and general symptom scores (SMD = -0.33, 95%CI:-0.87, 0.20; I(2) = not applicable, P = 0.22). For bipolar and unipolar depression, adjunctive folate was significantly superior to placebo in improving depressive symptoms. For bipolar disorder, adjunctive folate was effective in treating the acute phase of mania in bipolar disorder, but not in the acute phase of depression. For MDD, adjunctive folate was significantly superior to placebo in improving depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.38, 95%CI: -0.66, -0.09; I(2) = 71%, P = 0.01), which was confirmed in 5 of the 10 subgroups. Discontinuation due to any reason and adverse drug reactions were similar between folate and placebo in each diagnostic category.

Classical antidepressants are still not adequate in treating depression because of undesirable side effects. Folic acid, a member of the vitamin B complex, in considered to be strongly associated with the function and development of the central nervous system. Thus, in this study, we established a model of depression through chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in rats and assessed the antidepressant effects and mechanisms of folic acid. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: control, chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), CUMS treated with folic acid, and CUMS treated with citalopram. Rats were assessed in terms of weight change, open-field test and sucrose preference. Homocysteine, monoamine neurotransmitters, interleukin-6, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), β-endorphin levels in the serum and brains of rats were analysed. RESULTS: Folic acid exhibited antidepressant-like effects in open-field and sucrose preference tests. Folic acid treatment effectively increased the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters, BDNF and β-endorphin, interleukin-6 and homocysteine levels were also significantly suppressed by folic acid administration. CONCLUSIONS: These findings serve as preclinical evidence that folic acid plays an antidepressant-like role in several pathways involving monoamine neurotransmitters. Thus, folic acid may be used as a potential antidepressant.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zhou Y ; Cong Y ; Liu H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12868-020-0551-3 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/administration & dosage\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBiogenic Monoamines/metabolism\r\nBrain/drug effects/metabolism\r\nCitalopram/administration & dosage\r\nDepression/etiology/*metabolism/*prevention & control\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFolic Acid/*administration & dosage/blood\r\nHomocysteine/blood\r\nMale\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nStress, Psychological/*complications\r\nChronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)\r\nDepression-like behaviour\r\nFolic acid","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zhou Y, Cong Y, and Liu H (2020) Folic acid ameliorates depression-like behaviour in a rat model of chronic unpredictable mild stress..

Gender differences exist in both depression and vitamin D level. Our objective was to investigate the association between gender, vitamin D, clinical manifestations, and functional network connectivity in a large sample of MDD patients and healthy controls. Resting-state functional MRI data were collected from 122 patients and 119 controls, with independent component analysis adopted to examine large-scale inter- and intranetwork functional connectivity. Serum concentration of vitamin D (SCVD) and clinical manifestations were also assessed. MDD patients exhibited lower SCVD than controls in females but not males. Moreover, we identified a female-specific association between lower SCVD and poorer cognitive performance. Concurrently, MDD-related functional network connectivity changes were correlated with SCVD in females as well as depression and anxiety symptoms in female patients. Remarkably, MDD- and SCVD-related functional network connectivity alterations mediated the associations between SCVD and cognition in females. Aside from providing evidence for a female-specific neurobiological mechanism whereby low vitamin D might contribute to MDD and its associated clinical characteristics, our findings inform a novel conceptualization that adjuvant vitamin D supplementation therapy may yield clinical benefits in improving treatment outcomes in female patients with MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zhu DM ; Zhao W ; Cui S ; Jiang P ; Zhang Y ; Zhang C ; Zhu J ; Yu Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fnagi.2022.817607 ","Keywords":"functional MRI\r\nfunctional network connectivity\r\ngender\r\nmajor depressive disorder\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zhu DM, Zhao W, Cui S, Jiang P, Zhang Y, Zhang C, Zhu J, and Yu Y (2022) The Relationship Between Vitamin D, Clinical Manifestations, and Functional Network Connectivity in Female Patients With Major Depressive Disorder..
