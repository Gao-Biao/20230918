MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty male Swiss albino mice were divided into 4 groups (n = 10); control, CUMS, CUMS + fluoxetine, CUMS + musk. At the end of the experiment, behavior of the mice was assessed. Serum corticosterone level, hippocampal protein level of the glucocorticoid receptors, and brain-derived neurotropic factor were also assessed. Hippocampus was histopathologically examined. RESULTS: Musk improved depressive status induced after exposure to CUMS as evidenced by the forced swimming and open field tests and improved the short-term memory as evidenced by the elevated plus maze test. Musk reduced both corticosterone levels and the hippocampal neurodegenerative changes observed after exposure to CUMS. These improvements were comparable to those induced by fluoxetine. CONCLUSION: Musk alleviated the memory impairment and neurodegenerative changes induced after exposure to the chronic stress.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Abd El Wahab MG; Ali SS ; Ayuob NN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/1533317518755993 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor\r\nCorticosterone/blood\r\n*Disease Models, Animal\r\n*Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated\r\nFluoxetine/administration & dosage\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/pathology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nReceptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/administration & dosage\r\n*Stress, Psychological\r\nAlzheimer\r\nGR-BDNF\r\nchronic stress\r\ncorticosterone\r\ndepression\r\nmusk\r\nneurodegenerative","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Abd El Wahab MG, Ali SS, and Ayuob NN (2018) The Role of Musk in Relieving the Neurodegenerative Changes Induced After Exposure to Chronic Stress..

Channa striatus, a freshwater fish, is consumed in local Malay population as a rejuvenating diet during postpartum period. This study evaluated the antidepressant-like effect of lipid extract of C. striatus fillet and its mechanism of action in female Sprague-Dawley rats in postpartum model of depression. The rats were ovariectomized and treated with high dose of progesterone and estradiol benzoate for 23 days to have hormone-simulated pregnancy. The day 24 and afterwards were considered as the postpartum period. During the postpartum period, lipid extract was administered at 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg through intraperitoneal route for 15 days. Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) was used as the positive control. On postpartum day 15, the animals were tested in forced swimming test (FST) and open field test (OFT) followed by biochemical analysis. Withdrawal of hormone administration during the postpartum period induced depressive-like behavior in FST. Administration of lipid extract reversed that depressive-like behavior at 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg in FST. In OFT, it decreased the exploratory activity. The mechanism of the antidepressant-like effect may be mediated through the decrease in plasma corticosterone, increase in plasma oxytocin, and decrease in nuclear factor-kappa B in prefrontal cortex of rats.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Abdul Shukkoor MS; Baharuldin MTHB ; Mat Jais AM; Mohamad Moklas MA; Fakurazi S ; Basir R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1155/2017/1469209 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Abdul Shukkoor MS, Baharuldin MTHB, Mat Jais AM, Mohamad Moklas MA, Fakurazi S, and Basir R (2017) Antidepressant-Like Effect of Lipid Extract of Channa striatus in Postpartum Model of Depression in Rats..

Moreover, we evaluated whether the 5-HT(1A) and GABA(A) -benzodiazepine receptor systems are involved in the anxiolytic effects through the coadministration of WAY-100635 (a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist) and flumazenil (an antagonist of benzodiazepine). GC-MS revealed the monoterpene alcohols citronellol (35.9%) and geraniol (18.5%) as the main components of the P. roseum EO. EO was effective in increasing the total number of entries and time spent in the open arms of EPM whereas number of rearing in OFT was significantly decreased in comparison with the control. In the FST, immobility time decreased in EO treated mice. Pretreatment with WAY-100635, but not Flumazenil, was able to reverse the effects of the EO in the EPM and FST, indicating that the EO activity occurs via the serotonergic but not GABAergic transmission. Overall, results of this work showed significant anxiolytic and antidepressant activity of P. roseum EO and confirmed the traditional uses of Pelargonium species as calming agents.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Abouhosseini Tabari M; Hajizadeh Moghaddam A; Maggi F ; Benelli G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/ptr.6038 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnti-Anxiety Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety/*drug therapy\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nOils, Volatile/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nPelargonium/*chemistry\r\nSerotonin Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\n5-HT1A and GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor\r\nPelargonium roseum\r\nantidepressive-like activity\r\nessential oil","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Abouhosseini Tabari M, Hajizadeh Moghaddam A, Maggi F, and Benelli G (2018) Anxiolytic and antidepressant activities of Pelargonium roseum essential oil on Swiss albino mice: Possible involvement of serotonergic transmission..

Our understanding of the prevalence of Ω-3 fatty acid supplement consumption is of significance for future nutrition planning, health promotion and care delivery. However, we know little about Ω-3 fatty acid supplement consumption or users. This paper, drawing upon the largest dataset with regard to Ω-3 fatty acid supplement use (n=266 848), examines the use and users of this supplement among a large sample of older Australians living in New South Wales. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. Data were analysed from the 45 and Up Study, the largest study of healthy ageing ever undertaken in the Southern Hemisphere. SETTING: New South Wales, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 266 848 participants of the 45 and Up Study. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants' use of Ω-3, demographics (geographical location, marital status, education level, income and level of healthcare insurance) and health status (quality of life, history of smoking and alcohol consumption, health conditions) were measured. RESULTS: Of the 266 848 participants, 32.6% reported having taken Ω-3 in the 4 weeks prior to the survey. Use of Ω-3 fatty acid supplements was higher among men, non-smokers, non-to-mild (alcoholic) drinkers, residing in a major city, having higher income and private health insurance. Osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, high cholesterol and anxiety and/or depression were positively associated with Ω-3 fatty acid supplement use, while cancer and high blood pressure were negatively associated with use of Ω-3 fatty acid supplements. CONCLUSIONS: This study, analysing data from the 45 and Up Study cohort, suggests that a considerable proportion of older Australians consume Ω-3 fatty acid supplements. There is a need for primary healthcare practitioners to enquire with patients about this supplement use and for work to ensure provision of good-quality information for patients and providers with regard to Ω-3 fatty acid products.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Adams J ; Sibbritt D ; Lui CW ; Broom A ; Wardle J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1136/bmjopen-2012-002292 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Adams J, Sibbritt D, Lui CW, Broom A, and Wardle J (2013) {Omega}-3 fatty acid supplement use in the 45 and Up Study Cohort..

Palatable food has been shown to alter the activity of neural circuits, and obesity has been linked to alterations in the connectivity between the hypothalamus and cortical regions involved in decision-making and reward processing, putatively modulating the incentive value of food. Outlining neurophysiological adaptations induced by dietary intake of high fat diets (HFD) is thus valuable to establish how the diet by itself may promote overeating. To this end, C57BL/6 mice were fed HFD rich in either saturated fatty acids (HFD-S) or polyunsaturated fatty acids (HFD-P), or a low-fat control diet (LFD) for four weeks. Food and energy intake were monitored and ex vivo electrophysiology was employed to assess neuroadaptations in lateral hypothalamus (LH) and corticostriatal circuits, previously associated with food intake. In addition, the effects of dietary saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids on the gene expression of NMDA, AMPA and GABA(A) receptor subunits in the hypothalamus were investigated. Our data shows that mice fed HFD-P had increased daily food and energy intake compared with mice fed HFD-S or LFD. However, this increase in energy intake had no obesogenic effects. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that HFD-P had a selective effect on glutamatergic neurotransmission in the LH, which was concomitant with a change in mRNA expression of AMPA receptor subtypes Gria1, Gria3 and Gria4, with no effect on the mRNA expression of NMDA receptor subtypes or GABA(A) receptor subtypes. Furthermore, while synaptic output from corticostriatal subregions was not significantly modulated by diet, synaptic plasticity in the form of long-term depression (LTD) was impaired in the dorsomedial striatum of mice fed HFD-S. In conclusion, this study suggests that the composition of fatty acids in the diet not only affects weight gain, but may also modulate neuronal function and plasticity in brain regions involved in food intake.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Adermark L ; Gutierrez S ; Lagström O ; Hammarlund M ; Licheri V ; Johansson ME ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.psyneuen.2021.105143 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Diet, High-Fat\r\n*Fatty Acids\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nRNA, Messenger\r\nReceptors, GABA-A\r\n*Weight Gain\r\nLateral hypothalamus\r\nMedial prefrontal cortex\r\nPlasticity\r\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nSaturated fatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Adermark L, Gutierrez S, Lagström O, Hammarlund M, Licheri V, and Johansson ME (2021) Weight gain and neuroadaptations elicited by high fat diet depend on fatty acid composition..

Recent studies have revealed the relationship between diet and depression. In Iranian traditional medicine, there is a therapeutic diet that is recommended in melancholic diseases like depression. One of the main components of this diet is meat. Meats are divided into 2 groups: recommended and abstinent. The aim of this study was to clarify the logic of this diet through comparing nutritional elements of the 2 groups with each other. For this purpose, prominent books on Iranian traditional medicine were searched for abstinent and recommended meats traditionally prescribed for depressed patients. The results of each group were compared with the other by using Mann-Whitney Test (SPSS version 16). The results showed that recommended meats contain higher amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids ( P = .01) especially omega-3 ( P = .03). Both groups contain high amounts of cholesterol. Iranian traditional medicine recommends consumption of meats that contains cholesterol with omega-3 fatty acids in depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ahmadian-Attari MM ; Noorbala AA ; Khoshdel A ; Kamalinejad M ; Taghva A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/2156587215614703 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCholesterol/*analysis\r\nComplementary Therapies/methods\r\nDepression/diagnosis/*diet therapy/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nDiet Therapy/*methods\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*analysis\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIran\r\nMale\r\nMeat/*analysis\r\nNutrition Assessment\r\nNutritional Requirements\r\nIranian traditional medicine\r\ncholesterol\r\ndepression\r\ndiet therapy\r\nomega-3 fatty acid","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ahmadian-Attari MM, Noorbala AA, Khoshdel A, Kamalinejad M, and Taghva A (2017) Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Cholesterol Have a Main Role in Antidepression Diet of Iranian Traditional Medicine..

Lysophosphatidylcholine is a hydrolyzed phospholipid that is generated from the action of either phospholipase PLA(1) or PLA(2). There are two types of LPC; 1-LPC (where the omega-3 fatty acid at the sn-2 position is acylated) and 2-LPC (where the omega-3 fatty acid at the sn-1 position is acylated). The 2-LPC type is more highly bioavailable to the brain than the 1-LPC type. Given the biological and health aspects of LPC types, it is important to understand the structure, properties, extraction, quantification, functional role, and effect of the processing of LPC. This review examines various aspects involved in the extraction, characterization, and quantification of LPC. Further, the effects of processing methods on LPC and the potential biological roles of LPC in health and wellbeing are discussed. DHA-rich-LysoPLs, including LPC, can be enzymatically produced using lipases and phospholipases from wide microbial strains, and the highest yields were obtained by Lipozyme RM-IM(®), Lipozyme TL-IM(®), and Novozym 435(®). Terrestrial-based phospholipids generally contain lower levels of long-chain omega-3 PUFAs, and therefore, they are considered less effective in providing the same health benefits as marine-based LPC. Processing (e.g., thermal, fermentation, and freezing) reduces the PL in fish. LPC containing omega-3 PUFA, mainly DHA (C22:6 omega-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid EPA (C20:5 omega-3) play important role in brain development and neuronal cell growth. Additionally, they have been implicated in supporting treatment programs for depression and Alzheimer's. These activities appear to be facilitated by the acute function of a major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 2 (Mfsd2a), expressed in BBB endothelium, as a chief transporter for LPC-DHA uptake to the brain. LPC-based delivery systems also provide the opportunity to improve the properties of some bioactive compounds during storage and absorption. Overall, LPCs have great potential for improving brain health, but their safety and potentially negative effects should also be taken into consideration.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ahmmed MK ; Hachem M ; Ahmmed F ; Rashidinejad A ; Oz F ; Bekhit AA ; Carne A ; Bekhit AEA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/molecules28073088 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Lysophosphatidylcholines/chemistry\r\nBrain/metabolism\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3/metabolism\r\nMembrane Transport Proteins/metabolism\r\nBiological Transport\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/metabolism\r\nPhospholipids/metabolism\r\nFatty Acids/metabolism\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/metabolism\r\nMfsd2a transporter\r\nbioactive compounds\r\ncognitive function\r\ndisease management\r\ndrug delivery\r\nmarine lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)\r\nmental wellness\r\nneural health\r\nomega-3 supplementation\r\nprocessing impact\r\nstructural properties","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ahmmed MK, Hachem M, Ahmmed F, Rashidinejad A, Oz F, Bekhit AA, Carne A, and Bekhit AEA (2023) Marine Fish-Derived Lysophosphatidylcholine: Properties, Extraction, Quantification, and Brain Health Application..

One of the recommended treatment strategies in the international evidence-based guidelines is lifestyle modification, which includes diet and exercise, with the aim of improving a range of health outcomes. The incurable nature of PCOS reinforces the importance of developing novel and innovative symptomatic relief strategies, which are currently the only available approaches for improving quality of life for these women. Women with PCOS tend to be nutrient deficient in many common vitamins and minerals, thought to be associated with the psychological (depression, anxiety, etc.) and physiological (insulin resistance, diabetes, infertility, etc.) sequelae of the condition. Nutrient supplementation and the integration of complementary medicine as adjuncts to traditional lifestyle-based therapies in PCOS could therefore provide additional benefits to these women. In this review, we synthesize the evidence regarding nutrient supplementation and complementary therapies in PCOS, predominantly from randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, to provide an overview of the state of knowledge in this field. The evidence to date suggests that specific vitamins (B-12, inositols, folate, vitamins D, E, and K), vitamin-like nutrients (bioflavonoids and α-lipoic acid), minerals (calcium, zinc, selenium, and chromium picolinate), and other formulations (melatonin, ω-3 fatty acids, probiotics, and cinnamon), as well as some complementary approaches such as acupuncture and yoga may be beneficial in PCOS. However, there remain areas of uncertainty and key limitations in the literature that must be overcome before these therapies can be integrated into routine clinical practice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alesi S ; Ee C ; Moran LJ ; Rao V ; Mousa A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/advances/nmab141 ","Keywords":"*Complementary Therapies\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\n*Polycystic Ovary Syndrome/complications/drug therapy\r\nQuality of Life\r\nVitamins/therapeutic use\r\nPCOS\r\ncomplementary medicine\r\ndiet\r\nminerals\r\nnutraceutical\r\nnutrition\r\npolycystic ovary syndrome\r\nreview\r\nsupplementation\r\nvitamins","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alesi S, Ee C, Moran LJ, Rao V, and Mousa A (2022) Nutritional Supplements and Complementary Therapies in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome..

Animals specifically deficient in dietary n-3 fatty acids have low DHA content in their membranes, reduced visual acuity and impaired learning ability. Studies on bottle-fed human infants have shown that adding DHA and AA to milk replacer-formulas can bring their concentrations in the infant blood lipids to values as high as those produced by breast-feeding and significantly improves mental development and maturation of visual function. In older subjects, diverse neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases have been associated to decreased blood levels of n-3 PUFA. Low intakes of fish or of n-3 PUFA in populations have been associated with increased risks of depression and Alzheimer disease, and n-3 PUFA, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3), have shown efficacy as adjunctive treatment - and in some cases as the only treatment--in several psychiatric disorders.

In this study, it was investigated the behavioral and molecular effects of cotinine, and other antidepressant preparations infused intranasally. Intranasal (IN) cotinine, IN krill oil, IN cotinine plus krill oil, and oral sertraline were evaluated on depressive-like behavior and fear retention and extinction after fear conditioning in C57BL/6 mice. Since calcineurin A has been involved in facilitating fear extinction in rodents, we also investigated changes of calcineurin in the hippocampus, a region key on contextual fear extinction. Short-term treatment with cotinine formulations was superior to krill oil and oral sertraline in reducing depressive-like behavior and fear consolidation and enhancing contextual fear memory extinction in mice. IN krill oil slowed the extinction of fear. IN cotinine preparations increased the levels of calcineurin A in the hippocampus of conditioned mice. In the light of the results, the future investigation of the use of IN cotinine preparations for the extinction of contextual fear memory and treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in PTSD is discussed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alvarez-Ricartes N ; Oliveros-Matus P ; Mendoza C ; Perez-Urrutia N ; Echeverria F ; Iarkov A ; Barreto GE ; Echeverria V ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s12035-018-0916-0 ","Keywords":"Administration, Intranasal\r\nAnimals\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nCalcineurin/*metabolism\r\nConditioning, Psychological\r\nCotinine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/*psychology\r\nEuphausiacea/chemistry\r\nExtinction, Psychological/*drug effects\r\nFear/*drug effects\r\nHippocampus/*metabolism\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nModels, Biological\r\nOils/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nSertraline/pharmacology\r\nCotinine\r\nDepression\r\nFear extinction\r\nKrill oil\r\nPosttraumatic stress disorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alvarez-Ricartes N, Oliveros-Matus P, Mendoza C, Perez-Urrutia N, Echeverria F, Iarkov A, Barreto GE, and Echeverria V (2018) Intranasal Cotinine Plus Krill Oil Facilitates Fear Extinction, Decreases Depressive-Like Behavior, and Increases Hippocampal Calcineurin A Levels in Mice..

METHODS: This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 60 women with PCOS, aged 18-40 years old. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups to receive either 2 × 1000 mg/day fish oil omega-3 fatty acid (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) after lunch for 12 weeks. Metabolic profiles were quantified at baseline and after the 12-week intervention. RESULTS: Compared with the placebo, omega-3 fatty acid intake led to a significant improvement in Beck Depression Inventory [β (difference in the mean outcomes measures between treatment groups after intervention) -1.05; 95% CI: -1.84, -0.26; p = .01], general health questionnaire (β -1.68; 95% CI: -3.12, -0.24; p = .02) and depression anxiety and stress scale (β -2.03; 95% CI: -3.60, -0.46; p = .01). Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation significantly decreased serum insulin levels (β -2.09 µIU/mL; 95% CI: -3.77, -0.41; p = .01), homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (β -0.74; 95% CI: -1.13, -0.34; p < .001), total testosterone (β -0.23 ng/mL; 95% CI: -0.39, -0.06; p = .03) and hirsutism (β -0.75; 95% CI: -1.17, -0.33; p = .001), and significantly increased the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (β 0.01; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.02; p = .008) compared with the placebo. Additionally, omega-3 fatty acid intake resulted in a significant decrease in high sensitivity C-reactive protein (β -1.46 mg/L; 95% CI: -2.16, -0.75; p < .001) and malondialdehyde (β -0.28 µmol/L; 95% CI: -0.52, -0.05; p = .03); also significant rises in plasma total glutathione (β 59.09 µmol/L; 95% CI: 7.07, 111.11; p = .02) was observed compared with the placebo. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation did not change other metabolic parameters. CONCLUSION: Overall, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for 12 weeks to patients with PCOS had beneficial effects on mental health parameters, insulin metabolism, total testosterone, hirsutism and few inflammatory markers and oxidative stress.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Amini M ; Bahmani F ; Foroozanfard F ; Vahedpoor Z ; Ghaderi A ; Taghizadeh M ; Karbassizadeh H ; Asemi Z ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/0167482X.2018.1508282 ","Keywords":"Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation\r\nmental health\r\nmetabolic status\r\npolycystic ovary syndrome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Amini M, Bahmani F, Foroozanfard F, Vahedpoor Z, Ghaderi A, Taghizadeh M, Karbassizadeh H, and Asemi Z (2018) The effects of fish oil omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on mental health parameters and metabolic status of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial..

In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether adolescent nicotine exposure, followed by a period of abstinence, could affect the anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in rats. For this purpose, behavioral assessments were carried out using open field test, elevated plus maze and forced swimming test in male rats received chronic nicotine intake during adolescence followed by a period of abstinence in adulthood, compared to their control counterparts. In addition, O3 pre-treatment was done at three different doses to reveal whether it could prevent nicotine withdrawal effects. Then, animals were euthanized and the cortical concentrations of oxidative stress markers, inflammatory indices, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, serotonin and the enzymatic activity of monoamine oxidase-A were measured. Results indicated that nicotine withdrawal exacerbates the behavioral signs of anxiety through alteration of the brain oxidative stress balance, inflammatory response and serotonin metabolism. Moreover, we found that omega 3 pre-treatment significantly prevents the nicotine withdrawal-induced complications by restoration of changes in the mentioned biochemical indices. Moreover, the improving effects of O3 fatty acids were found to be dose-dependent in all experiments. Taken together, we would like to suggest the O3 fatty acids supplementation as a safe, inexpensive and effective strategy for prevention or amelioration of detrimental effects induced by nicotine withdrawal at cellular and behavioral levels.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Amiry GY ; Haidary M ; Azhdari-Zarmehri H ; Beheshti F ; Ahmadi-Soleimani SM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejphar.2023.175634 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nMale\r\nRats\r\nAnxiety/chemically induced/prevention & control/drug therapy\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor\r\nDepression/chemically induced/drug therapy/prevention & control\r\n*Nicotine/pharmacology\r\nOxidative Stress\r\nSerotonin\r\n*Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/drug therapy/prevention & control\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/pharmacology\r\nAdolescent\r\nInflammation\r\nNicotine\r\nOmega-3\r\nOxidative stress\r\nSerotonin","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Amiry GY, Haidary M, Azhdari-Zarmehri H, Beheshti F, and Ahmadi-Soleimani SM (2023) Omega-3 fatty acids prevent nicotine withdrawal-induced exacerbation of anxiety and depression by affecting oxidative stress balance, inflammatory response, BDNF and serotonin metabolism in rats..

Fifteen adolescents with BPD (mean age 16.2 years, [SD 2.1]) were randomized to either 1.2 g/day n-3 PUFAs or placebo. The intervention period was 12 weeks. Study measures included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Global Assessment of Functioning. Side effects were documented with the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersøgelser. Fatty acids in erythrocytes were analyzed using capillary gas chromatography. RESULTS: At baseline, erythrocyte n-3 PUFA levels correlated positively with psychosocial functioning and negatively with psychopathology. By the end of the intervention, n-3 PUFAs significantly improved functioning and reduced psychiatric symptoms, compared with placebo. Side effects did not differ between the treatment groups.

The study failed to show benefits of n-3 PUFAs over placebo. Although the randomized controlled trial design is placed at the top of the evidence hierarchy, this methodology has limitations in fish oil randomized controlled trials, as not only is the test agent present in the intervention group, but also n-3 fats are present in the diet and the body tissue of all participants. METHODS: Analysis of biomarker data (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], n-3 index, EPA+DHA) collected as part of NEURAPRO was conducted on 218 participants with longitudinal biomarker data to determine if n-3 PUFAs measured in erythrocytes at baseline and month 6 predicted clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Increases of the n-3 index, EPA, and DHA predicted less severe psychopathology and better functioning at both follow-up time points. Higher baseline levels and increases of n-3 index also predicted overall clinical improvement at month 6 (n-3 index baseline: adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 1.79 [1.30-2.48]; n-3 PUFA increase: adjusted odds ratio [95% CI] = 1.43 [1.16-1.76]) and at month 12 (n-3 index baseline: adjusted odds ratio [95% CI] = 2.60 [1.71-3.97]; n-3 PUFA increase: adjusted odds ratio [95% CI] = 1.36 [1.06-1.74]). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that n-3 PUFAs can exert therapeutic effects in ultra-high-risk individuals. This finding has implications for early intervention and treatment guidelines, as n-3 PUFA supplementation can easily and safely be used in a wide variety of settings, from primary care to specialist services.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Amminger GP ; Nelson B ; Markulev C ; Yuen HP ; Schäfer MR ; Berger M ; Mossaheb N ; Schlögelhofer M ; Smesny S ; Hickie IB ; Berger GE ; Chen EYH ; de Haan L ; Nieman DH ; Nordentoft M ; Riecher-Rössler A ; Verma S ; Thompson A ; Yung AR ; McGorry PD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopsych.2019.08.030 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nBiomarkers\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3\r\nHumans\r\n*Psychotic Disorders/drug therapy\r\nAnxiety\r\nDepression\r\nEarly psychosis\r\nLipid biology\r\nOmega-3 fatty acids\r\nRCT","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Amminger GP, Nelson B, Markulev C, Yuen HP, Schäfer MR, Berger M, Mossaheb N, Schlögelhofer M, Smesny S, Hickie IB, Berger GE, Chen EYH, de Haan L, Nieman DH, Nordentoft M, Riecher-Rössler A, Verma S, Thompson A, Yung AR, and McGorry PD (2020) The NEURAPRO Biomarker Analysis: Long-Chain Omega-3 Fatty Acids Improve 6-Month and 12-Month Outcomes in Youths at Ultra-High Risk for Psychosis..

In this paper, we review the published scientific evidence on the benefits and risks of CAM for the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder. Since very few studies of CAM have involved patients with bipolar disorder, most available evidence is derived from trials conducted in patients with major depressive disorder. The use of omega-3 fatty acids has been studied in two controlled studies in bipolar disorder while St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAMe), and acupuncture have been studied in a series of randomized controlled trials in patients with major depression. Overall, the best evidence supports the use of St. John's wort for the treatment of mild to moderate depression. SAMe may also be effective for depression. However, both of these products have the potential to induce mania; the extent of this risk needs to be quantified. St. John's wort can also interact with a variety of medications. Evidence regarding the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids or acupuncture is inconsistent. Data regarding other CAM interventions (e.g., aromatherapy massage, massage therapy, yoga) are almost entirely lacking.

Inhalation of EOs can regulate brain health and functions associated with mood and neurodegeneration, reflecting their bioavailability to brain. The aim was to identify physicochemical properties that influenced EO volatility and pathways of brain uptake by inhalation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dose-dependency of effects, determined as: total EO intake (μg/g bodyweight-BW), and rate of EO intake (μg/hr/g-BW), was determined by meta-analysis of data from animal studies (10 studies, 12 EOs), measuring effects on anxiety, depression and selected biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation (OSI). RESULTS: Results demonstrated benefits on animal behavior at EO intakes of 1-100 μg/g BW and 1-10 μg/hr/g BW (Elevated Plus Maze and Forced Swimming tests) and <100 μg/g BW and 10-100 g/hr/g BW (Marble Burying). EOs regulated OSI biomarkers at intakes of 10-100 μg/g BW and 1-10 μg/h/g BW, and a dose-dependent elevation of dopamine at >1000 μg/g BW and 100-1000 μg/hr/g BW. CONCLUSION: The results support that EO 'aromatherapy' can promote dose-dependent regulation of anxiety, depression and OSI and that efficacy requires optimization of dose.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aponso M ; Patti A ; Bennett LE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jep.2019.112469 ","Keywords":"Administration, Inhalation\r\nAnimals\r\nAnxiety/*drug therapy\r\nAromatherapy/methods\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBiomarkers/metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nHumans\r\nInflammation/drug therapy\r\nMice\r\nOils, Volatile/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nOxidative Stress/*drug effects\r\nRats\r\nAbsorption\r\nBehaviour\r\nBiomarker\r\nDose response\r\nEssential oil\r\nInflammation\r\nInhale\r\nOxidative stress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aponso M, Patti A, and Bennett LE (2020) Dose-related effects of inhaled essential oils on behavioural measures of anxiety and depression and biomarkers of oxidative stress..

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically review all published randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of n-3 PUFAs on depressed mood. DESIGN: Eight medical and health databases were searched over all years of records until June 2006 for trials that exposed participants to n-3 PUFAs or fish, measured depressed mood, were conducted on human participants, and included a comparison group. RESULTS: Eighteen randomized controlled trials were identified; 12 were included in a meta-analysis. The pooled standardized difference in mean outcome (fixed-effects model) was 0.13 SDs (95% CI: 0.01, 0.25) in those receiving n-3 PUFAs compared with placebo, with strong evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 79%, P < 0.001). The presence of funnel plot asymmetry suggested that publication bias was the likely source of heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses that excluded one large trial increased the effect size estimates but did not reduce heterogeneity. Meta-regression provided some evidence that the effect was stronger in trials involving populations with major depression-the difference in the effect size estimates was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.05, 1.41; P = 0.04), but there was still considerable heterogeneity when trials that involved populations with major depression were pooled separately (I2 = 72%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Trial evidence that examines the effects of n-3 PUFAs on depressed mood is limited and is difficult to summarize and evaluate because of considerable heterogeneity. The evidence available provides little support for the use of n-3 PUFAs to improve depressed mood. Larger trials with adequate power to detect clinically important benefits are required.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Appleton KM ; Hayward RC ; Gunnell D ; Peters TJ ; Rogers PJ ; Kessler D ; Ness AR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/ajcn/84.6.1308 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nChild\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/epidemiology\r\n*Diet\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMood Disorders/*drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nPsychometrics\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Appleton KM, Hayward RC, Gunnell D, Peters TJ, Rogers PJ, Kessler D, and Ness AR (2006) Effects of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids on depressed mood: systematic review of published trials..

This study aimed to evaluate this association in a large population-based sample of UK individuals. N-3 EFA intake (intake from fish alone, and from all sources (fish and supplements)), depressed mood (assessed using the short-form Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales) and demographic variables (sex, age, Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) based on postal code, and date of questionnaire completion) were obtained simultaneously by self-report questionnaire (N = 2982). Using polynomial regression, a non-linear relationship between depressed mood and n-3 EFA intake from fish was found, with the incremental decrease in depressed mood diminishing as n-3 EFA intake increased. However, this relationship was attenuated by adjustment for age and IMD. No relationship between depression and n-3 EFA intake from all sources was found. These findings suggest that higher levels of n-3 EFA intake from fish are associated with lower levels of depressed mood, but the association disappears after adjustment for age and social deprivation, and after inclusion of n-3 EFA intake from supplements. This study does have a number of limitations, but the findings available suggest that the apparent associations between depressed mood and n-3 EFA intake from fish may simply reflect a wider association between depressed mood and lifestyle.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Appleton KM ; Peters TJ ; Hayward RC ; Heatherley SV ; McNaughton SA ; Rogers PJ ; Gunnell D ; Ness AR ; Kessler D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00127-006-0142-3 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAnxiety/diagnosis/epidemiology/psychology\r\nDepression/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*psychology\r\n*Eating\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage/*metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nFish Products/*statistics & numerical data\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Appleton KM, Peters TJ, Hayward RC, Heatherley SV, McNaughton SA, Rogers PJ, Gunnell D, Ness AR, and Kessler D (2007) Depressed mood and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake from fish: non-linear or confounded association?.

DESIGN: Eight databases were searched for trials that randomly assigned participants to receive n-3 PUFAs/fish, measured depressed mood, used human participants, and included a comparison group up to April 2009. RESULTS: Thirty-five randomized controlled trials were identified; 17 were not included in the previous review.

One emerging potential treatment for MDD is n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFAs), also known as omega-3 oils, naturally found in fatty fish, some other seafood, and some nuts and seeds. Various lines of evidence suggest a role for n-3PUFAs in MDD, but the evidence is far from conclusive. Reviews and meta-analyses clearly demonstrate heterogeneity between studies. Investigations of heterogeneity suggest differential effects of n-3PUFAs, depending on severity of depressive symptoms, where no effects of n-3PUFAs are found in studies of individuals with mild depressive symptomology, but possible benefit may be suggested in studies of individuals with more severe depressive symptomology. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (also known as omega-3 fatty acids) versus a comparator (e.g. placebo, anti-depressant treatment, standard care, no treatment, wait-list control) for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Registers (CCDANCTR) and International Trial Registries over all years to May 2015. We searched the database CINAHL over all years of records to September 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies in the review if they: were a randomised controlled trial; provided n-3PUFAs as an intervention; used a comparator; measured depressive symptomology as an outcome; and were conducted in adults with MDD. Primary outcomes were depressive symptomology (continuous data collected using a validated rating scale) and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were depressive symptomology (dichotomous data on remission and response), quality of life, and failure to complete studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We found 26 relevant studies: 25 studies involving a total of 1438 participants investigated the impact of n-3PUFA supplementation compared to placebo, and one study involving 40 participants investigated the impact of n-3PUFA supplementation compared to antidepressant treatment.For the placebo comparison, n-3PUFA supplementation results in a small to modest benefit for depressive symptomology, compared to placebo: standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.12 to -0.52; 25 studies, 1373 participants, very low quality evidence), but this effect is unlikely to be clinically meaningful (an SMD of 0.32 represents a difference between groups in scores on the HDRS (17-item) of approximately 2.2 points (95% CI 0.8 to 3.6)). The confidence intervals include both a possible clinically important effect and a possible negligible effect, and there is considerable heterogeneity between the studies. Although the numbers of individuals experiencing adverse events were similar in intervention and placebo groups (odds ratio (OR) 1.24, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.62; 19 studies, 1207 participants; very low-quality evidence), the confidence intervals include a significant increase in adverse events with n-3PUFAs as well as a small possible decrease. Rates of remission and response, quality of life, and rates of failure to complete studies were also similar between groups, but confidence intervals are again wide.The evidence on which these results are based is very limited. All studies contributing to our analyses were of direct relevance to our research question, but we rated the quality of the evidence for all outcomes as low to very low. The number of studies and number of participants contributing to all analyses were low, and the majority of studies were small and judged to be at high risk of bias on several measures. Our analyses were also likely to be highly influenced by three large trials. Although we judge these trials to be at low risk of bias, they contribute 26.9% to 82% of data. Our effect size estimates are also imprecise. Funnel plot asymmetry and sensitivity analyses (using fixed-effect models, and only studies judged to be at low risk of selection bias, performance bias or attrition bias) also suggest a likely bias towards a positive finding for n-3PUFAs. There was substantial heterogeneity in analyses of our primary outcome of depressive symptomology. This heterogeneity was not explained by the presence or absence of comorbidities or by the presence or absence of adjunctive therapy.Only one study was available for the antidepressant comparison, involving 40 participants. This study found no differences between treatment with n-3PUFAs and treatment with antidepressants in depressive symptomology (mean difference (MD) -0.70 (95% CI -5.88 to 4.48)), rates of response to treatment or failure to complete. Adverse events were not reported in a manner suitable for analysis, and rates of depression remission and quality of life were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: At present, we do not have sufficient high quality evidence to determine the effects of n-3PUFAs as a treatment for MDD. Our primary analyses suggest a small-to-modest, non-clinically beneficial effect of n-3PUFAs on depressive symptomology compared to placebo; however the estimate is imprecise, and we judged the quality of the evidence on which this result is based to be low/very low. Sensitivity analyses, funnel plot inspection and comparison of our results with those of large well-conducted trials also suggest that this effect estimate is likely to be biased towards a positive finding for n-3PUFAs, and that the true effect is likely to be smaller. Our data, however, also suggest similar rates of adverse events and numbers failing to complete trials in n-3PUFA and placebo groups, but again our estimates are very imprecise. The one study that directly compares n-3PUFAs and antidepressants in our review finds comparable benefit. More evidence, and more complete evidence, are required, particularly regarding both the potential positive and negative effects of n-3PUFAs for MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Appleton KM ; Sallis HM ; Perry R ; Ness AR ; Churchill R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD004692.pub4 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Appleton KM, Sallis HM, Perry R, Ness AR, and Churchill R (2015) Omega-3 fatty acids for depression in adults..

One potential treatment for MDD is n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFAs), also known as omega-3 oils, naturally found in fatty fish, some other seafood, and some nuts and seeds. Various lines of evidence suggest a role for n-3PUFAs in MDD, but the evidence is far from conclusive. Reviews and meta-analyses clearly demonstrate heterogeneity between studies. Investigations of heterogeneity suggest different effects of n-3PUFAs, depending on the severity of depressive symptoms, where no effects of n-3PUFAs are found in studies of individuals with mild depressive symptomology, but possible benefit may be suggested in studies of individuals with more severe depressive symptomology. Hence it is important to establish their effectiveness in treating MDD. This review updates and incorporates an earlier review with the same research objective (Appleton 2015). OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (also known as omega-3 fatty acids) versus a comparator (e.g. placebo, antidepressant treatment, standard care, no treatment, wait-list control) for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO together with trial registries and grey literature sources (to 9 January 2021). We checked reference lists and contacted authors of included studies for additional information when necessary. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies in the review if they: used a randomised controlled trial design; provided n-3PUFAs as an intervention; used a comparator; measured depressive symptomology as an outcome; and were conducted in adults with MDD. Primary outcomes were depressive symptomology (continuous data collected using a validated rating scale) and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were depressive symptomology (dichotomous data on remission and response), quality of life, and non-completion of studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS: The review includes 35 relevant studies: 34 studies involving a total of 1924 participants investigated the impact of n-3PUFA supplementation compared to placebo, and one study involving 40 participants investigated the impact of n-3PUFA supplementation compared to antidepressant treatment. For the placebo comparison, n-3PUFA supplementation resulted in a small to modest benefit for depressive symptomology, compared to placebo: standardised mean difference (SMD) (random-effects model) -0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.64 to -0.16; 33 studies, 1848 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but this effect is unlikely to be clinically meaningful. An SMD of 0.40 represents a difference between groups in scores on the HDRS (17-item) of approximately 2.5 points (95% CI 1.0 to 4.0), where the minimal clinically important change score on this scale is 3.0 points. The confidence intervals include both a possible clinically important effect and a possible negligible effect, and there is considerable heterogeneity between studies. Sensitivity analyses, funnel plot inspection and comparison of our results with those of large well-conducted trials also suggest that this effect estimate may be biased towards a positive finding for n-3PUFAs. Although the numbers of individuals experiencing adverse events were similar in intervention and placebo groups (odds ratio (OR) 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.64; 24 studies, 1503 participants; very low-certainty evidence), the confidence intervals include a small decrease to a modest increase in adverse events with n-3PUFAs. There was no evidence for a difference between n-3PUFA and placebo groups in remission rates (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.72; 8 studies, 609 participants, low-certainty evidence), response rates (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.79; 17 studies, 794 participants; low-certainty evidence), quality of life (SMD -0.38 (95% CI -0.82 to 0.06), 12 studies, 476 participants, very low-certainty evidence), or trial non-completion (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.22; 29 studies, 1777 participants, very low-certainty evidence). The evidence on which these results are based was also very limited, highly heterogeneous, and potentially biased. Only one study, involving 40 participants, was available for the antidepressant comparison. This study found no differences between treatment with n-3PUFAs and treatment with antidepressants in depressive symptomology (mean difference (MD) -0.70, 95% CI -5.88 to 4.48), rates of response to treatment (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.31), or trial non-completion (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.71). Confidence intervals are however very wide in all analyses, and do not rule out important beneficial or detrimental effects of n-3PUFAs compared to antidepressants. Adverse events were not reported in a manner suitable for analysis, and rates of depression remission and quality of life were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: At present, we do not have sufficient high-certainty evidence to determine the effects of n-3PUFAs as a treatment for MDD. Our primary analyses may suggest a small-to-modest, non-clinically beneficial effect of n-3PUFAs on depressive symptomology compared to placebo; however the estimate is imprecise, and we judged the certainty of the evidence on which this result is based to be low to very low. Our data may also suggest similar rates of adverse events and trial non-completion in n-3PUFA and placebo groups, but again our estimates are very imprecise. Effects of n-3PUFAs compared to antidepressants are very imprecise and uncertain. More complete evidence is required for both the potential positive and negative effects of n-3PUFAs for MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Appleton KM ; Voyias PD ; Sallis HM ; Dawson S ; Ness AR ; Churchill R ; Perry R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD004692.pub5 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nQuality of Life\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Appleton KM, Voyias PD, Sallis HM, Dawson S, Ness AR, Churchill R, and Perry R (2021) Omega-3 fatty acids for depression in adults..

It is hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acids, which are components of fish oil, may attenuate depression symptoms. In order to examine this hypothesis, the animal model of postpartum depression was established in the present study. Ovariectomized female rats underwent hormone-simulated pregnancy (HSP) regimen and received progesterone and estradiol benzoate or vehicle for 23 days, mimicking the actual rat's pregnancy. The days after hormone termination were considered as the postpartum period. Forced feeding of menhaden fish oil, as a source of omega-3, with three doses of 1, 3, and 9g/kg/d, fluoxetine 15mg/kg/d, and distilled water 2ml/d per rat started in five postpartum-induced and one vehicle group on postpartum day 1 and continued for 15 consecutive days. On postpartum day 15, all groups were tested in the forced swimming test (FST) and open field test (OFT), followed by a biochemical assay. Results showed that the postpartum-induced rats not treated with menhaden fish oil, exhibited an increase in immobility time seen in FST, hippocampal concentration of corticosterone and plasmatic level of corticosterone, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. These depression-related effects were attenuated by supplementation of menhaden fish oil with doses of 3 and 9g/kg. Moreover, results of rats supplemented with menhaden fish oil were comparable to rats treated with the clinically effective antidepressant, fluoxetine. Taken together, these results suggest that menhaden fish oil, rich in omega-3, exerts beneficial effect on postpartum depression and decreases the biomarkers related to depression such as corticosterone and pro-inflammatory cytokines.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Arbabi L ; Baharuldin MT ; Moklas MA ; Fakurazi S ; Muhammad SI ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2014.05.036 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nCorticosterone/blood/metabolism\r\nCytokines/blood/metabolism\r\nDepression, Postpartum/chemically induced/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nEstradiol/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*pharmacology\r\nFemale\r\nFish Oils/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nFluoxetine/pharmacology\r\nHippocampus/drug effects\r\nLocomotion/drug effects\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nOvariectomy\r\nPostpartum Period/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nPregnancy\r\nProgesterone/administration & dosage/pharmacology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSwimming\r\nCorticosterone\r\nForced swimming test\r\nHormone simulated pregnancy\r\nOmega-3 fatty acid\r\nPostpartum depression\r\nPro-inflammatory cytokine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Arbabi L, Baharuldin MT, Moklas MA, Fakurazi S, and Muhammad SI (2014) Antidepressant-like effects of omega-3 fatty acids in postpartum model of depression in rats..

This study aims to assess the efficacy of musk in alleviating the behavioral, biochemical and histopathological changes induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in an animal model of depression and to explore the underlying mechanism of this effect. Male Swiss albino mice were divided into four groups (n = 10): control, CUMS, CUMS+fluoxetine and CUMS+musk. At the end of the experiment, behavioral tests were administered and serum corticosterone and testosterone levels were assessed. Surface markers, proteins and gene expressions of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in the hippocampus were assessed. The immunoexpression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, Ki67 and caspase-3 was also assessed. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Musk alleviated the behavioral changes caused by CUMS and reduced elevated corticosterone levels. It reduced CUMS-induced neuronal atrophy in the CA3 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and restored astrocytes. Musk reduced the neuro- and glial apoptosis observed in stressed mice in a manner comparable to that of fluoxetine.

Forty male albino mice were distributed equally into four groups; control (untreated), CUMS (exposed to CUMS for 4 weeks), CUMS+fluoxetine (FLU) (exposed to CUMS then treated with FLU, CUMS+musk (exposed to CUMS then treated with musk). Behavioral changes and serum corticosterone levels were assessed at the end of the experiment. The submandibular and parotid glands were dissected out and processed for histopathological and immunohistochemical examination using antibodies against alpha smooth muscle actin (ASMA) and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). Exposure to CUMS significantly (P < 0.001) increased the serum corticosterone level and induced depression. CUMS also induced vacuolation in acinar cells along with a significant (P < 0.001) reduction of ASMA immunoexpression, indicating an effect on myoepithelial cells, and a significant (P < 0.001) increase of BDNF expression in the gland ductal system. Both FLU and musk alleviated the CUMS-induced behavioral, biochemical and histopathological changes in the salivary glands. In conclusion, musk ameliorates stress-induced structural changes in mouse salivary glands. This effect might be mediated through up-regulation of BDNF secretion by the glands.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ayuob NN ; Abdel-Tawab HS ; El-Mansy AA ; Ali SS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2334/josnusd.17-0440 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nBody Weight\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nChronic Disease\r\nCorticosterone/blood\r\n*Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nSalivary Glands/metabolism/*physiopathology\r\n*Stress, Physiological\r\nBDNF\r\nfluoxetine\r\nmusk\r\nparotid\r\nstress\r\nsubmandibular","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ayuob NN, Abdel-Tawab HS, El-Mansy AA, and Ali SS (2019) The protective role of musk on salivary glands of mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress..

Although omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are reported to be promising nutrients for treating depression, currently, there are no systematic reviews or meta-analyses of randomized control trials that provide critical evidence regarding the potential benefits of omega-3 fatty acids in elderly patients with depression. This analysis was conducted to provide evidence for the clinical application of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of depressive symptoms of elderly subjects older than 65 years. Seven databases were searched from their inception date until September 2016. Following this search, 6 studies were selected, which included 4605 patients (mean age, 76.97 years; male-female ratio=3752:853; mean dose of omega 3 intake, 1.3 g/d). These results were divided into 2 categories: well-being mental health group and depressive group. In the well-being mental health group, the Hedges g was 0.12 (95% confidence interval, -0.05 to 0.29), which indicated no significant effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation on depressed mood compared with placebo. In the depressive group, the pooled Hedges g was -0.94 (95% CI, -1.37 to -0.50]) for the random-effects model, which indicated a large effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation on those with depressed mood compared with placebo. Although this review shows that omega-3 fatty acids are effective in the treatment of elderly depressed patients, the benefits of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation were significant only in the elderly patients with mild to moderate depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bae JH ; Kim G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.nutres.2017.10.013 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMental Health\r\nDepression\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nOmega-3-fatty acids\r\nSystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bae JH, and Kim G (2018) Systematic review and meta-analysis of omega-3-fatty acids in elderly patients with depression..

METHODS: Relevant electronic databases were searched from their inception to June 4, 2018, including Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Global Health, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and Chinese Biomedical Medicine Database. Two reviewers independently screened for eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of the included studies. The effect size data were analyzed using robust variance estimation in meta-regression. RESULTS: Nine studies were included. The overall treatment effects of n-3 PUFA supplements in reducing depressive symptoms for older adults was not statistically significant (d = -0.202, 95% CI = -0.463, 0.060). Meta-regression found interventions with dosage of n-3 PUFA greater than 1.5 g/d had an average effect size of -0.428, with a 95% confidence interval of [-0.822, -0.035], which is statistically significant. Meta-regression did not find significant moderating effects of comorbidity, baseline depression, intervention duration, and EPA-DHA ratio, potentially due to limited statistical power. LIMITATIONS: The current review only included 9 studies based on literature search in major English and Chinese databases, which provided limited statistical power for moderator analysis and the results are suggestive only. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis of 9 RCTs found mixed findings of the efficacy of n-3 PUFA in the treatment of depressive symptoms among older adults aged 60 and above. More high-quality, large-scale RCTs are needed to confirm the current conclusions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bai ZG ; Bo A ; Wu SJ ; Gai QY ; Chi I ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2018.07.057 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nDepression/*therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nDepressive symptoms\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nN-3 PUFAs\r\nOlder adults","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bai ZG, Bo A, Wu SJ, Gai QY, and Chi I (2018) Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and reduction of depressive symptoms in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis..

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play several important roles in brain development and functioning. Evidence from animal models of dietary omega-3 (n-3) PUFA deficiency suggest that these fatty acids are relevant to promote brain development and to regulate behavioral and neurochemical aspects related to mood disorders, such as stress responses, depression and aggression, as well as dopaminergic content and function. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests roles for PUFAs in BD. n-3 PUFAs seem to be an effective adjunctive treatment for unipolar and bipolar depression, but further large-scale, well-controlled trials are needed to examine its clinical utility in BD. The use of n-3 as a mood stabilizer among BD patients is discussed here. This article summarizes the molecular pathways related to the role of n-3 as a neuroprotective and neurogenic agent, with a specific focus on BDNF. It is proposed that the n-3-BDNF association is involved in the pathophysiology of BD and represents a promising target for developing a novel class of rationally devised therapies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Balanzá-Martínez V ; Fries GR ; Colpo GD ; Silveira PP ; Portella AK ; Tabarés-Seisdedos R ; Kapczinski F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1586/ern.11.42 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/metabolism/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Balanzá-Martínez V, Fries GR, Colpo GD, Silveira PP, Portella AK, Tabarés-Seisdedos R, and Kapczinski F (2011) Therapeutic use of omega-3 fatty acids in bipolar disorder..

PUFAs and their mediators regulate several processes within the brain, such as neurotransmission, cell survival and neuroinflammation, and thereby mood and cognition. PUFA levels and the signalling pathways that they regulate are altered in various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and major depression. Diet and drugs targeting PUFAs may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of brain disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bazinet RP ; Layé S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/nrn3820 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrain/*metabolism\r\nBrain Diseases/*metabolism/physiopathology\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/*physiology\r\nHumans\r\nSignal Transduction/*physiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bazinet RP, and Layé S (2014) Polyunsaturated fatty acids and their metabolites in brain function and disease..

It was previously assumed that because EPA is extremely low in the brain it did not cross the blood-brain barrier and any therapeutic effects it exerted would be via the periphery. However, more recent studies have established that EPA does enter the brain, but is rapidly metabolised following entry. While EPA does not accumulate within the brain, it is present in microglia and homeostatic mechanisms may regulate its esterification to phospholipids that serve important roles in cell signaling. Furthermore, a variety of signaling molecules from EPA have been described in the periphery and they have the potential to exert effects within the brain. If EPA is confirmed to be therapeutic in major depression as a result of adequately powered randomized clinical trials, future research on brain EPA metabolism could lead to the discovery of novel targets for treating or preventing major depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bazinet RP ; Metherel AH ; Chen CT ; Shaikh SR ; Nadjar A ; Joffre C ; Layé S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbi.2019.07.001 ","Keywords":"Brain\r\nDepression\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids\r\n*Eicosapentaenoic Acid\r\nHumans\r\nPhospholipids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bazinet RP, Metherel AH, Chen CT, Shaikh SR, Nadjar A, Joffre C, and Layé S (2020) Brain eicosapentaenoic acid metabolism as a lead for novel therapeutics in major depression..

Although initial preclinical and clinical development efforts focused on pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase to elevate levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide, more recent efforts have focused on inhibition of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) to enhance signaling of the most abundant and efficacious endocannabinoid ligand, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). We review the biochemistry and physiology of 2-AG signaling and preclinical evidence supporting a role for this system in the regulation of anxiety-related outcomes and stress adaptation. We review preclinical evidence supporting MAGL inhibition for the treatment of affective, trauma-related, and stress-related disorders; describe the current state of MAGL inhibitor drug development; and discuss biological factors that could affect MAGL inhibitor efficacy. Issues related to the clinical advancement of MAGL inhibitors are also discussed. We are cautiously optimistic, as the field of MAGL inhibitor development transitions from preclinical to clinical and theoretical to practical, that pharmacological 2-AG augmentation could represent a mechanistically novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of affective and stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bedse G ; Hill MN ; Patel S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopsych.2020.01.015 ","Keywords":"Anxiety/drug therapy\r\nArachidonic Acids\r\n*Endocannabinoids\r\nEnzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology\r\n*Glycerides\r\nMonoacylglycerol Lipases\r\nAmygdala\r\nAnxiety\r\nCannabinoid\r\nDepression\r\nEndocannabinoid\r\nMarijuana\r\nStress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bedse G, Hill MN, and Patel S (2020) 2-Arachidonoylglycerol Modulation of Anxiety and Stress Adaptation: From Grass Roots to Novel Therapeutics..

Changes in the microbiota-gut-brain axis are responsible for developing various metabolic, neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric disorders. According to clinical and preclinical findings, the gut microbiota is a significant regulator of the gut-brain axis. In addition to interacting with intestinal cells and the enteric nervous system, it has been discovered that microbes in the gut can modify the central nervous system through metabolic and neuroendocrine pathways. The metabolites of the gut microbiome can modulate a number of diseases by inducing epigenetic alteration through DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA-associated gene silencing. Short-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, are well-known histone deacetylases inhibitors. Similarly, other microbial metabolites such as folate, choline, and trimethylamine-N-oxide also regulate epigenetics mechanisms. Furthermore, various studies have revealed the potential role of microbiome dysbiosis and epigenetics in the pathophysiology of depression. Hence, in this review, we have highlighted the role of gut dysbiosis in epigenetic regulation, causal interaction between host epigenetic modification and the gut microbiome in depression and suggest microbiome and epigenome as a possible target for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Begum N ; Mandhare A ; Tryphena KP ; Srivastava S ; Shaikh MF ; Singh SB ; Khatri DK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fnagi.2022.1048333 ","Keywords":"DNA methylation\r\ndepression\r\nepigenetic\r\ngut-brain axis (GBA)\r\nhistone modifications\r\nmicrobiome\r\nmicrobiota\r\nshort-chain fatty acid (SCFA)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Begum N, Mandhare A, Tryphena KP, Srivastava S, Shaikh MF, Singh SB, and Khatri DK (2022) Epigenetics in depression and gut-brain axis: A molecular crosstalk..

Recent reports suggest that the availability of fish and seafood may be associated with lower depression rates. The aim of this study was to investigate associations of fish consumption and LCPUFA levels with depressive symptoms.Methods Participants for this cross-sectional study (n=206) were recruited at a community screening programme in two Torres Strait Islander communities (Mer and Waiben). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the adapted Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (aPHQ-9) and diet with a structured questionnaire. LCPUFA concentrations were measured with a capillary dried blood spot system (PUFAcoat). Logistic and quantile regression modelling was used to test the relationship between seafood consumption, membrane LCPUFAs and depression scores.Results A higher blood n-6/3 LCPUFA ratio was associated with moderate/severe depression scores across both study sites (OR=1.59 (95%CI 1.09-2.34), P = .017). Seafood consumption was higher and the proportion of participants with aPHQ-9 scores above the cut-off for depression was lower on Mer (n = 100) compared with Waiben (n = 106). Higher seafood consumption was associated with lower depression scores on Waiben (B = -0.57 (95%CI -0.98 - -0.16), P = .006) but not on Mer.Conclusions Our findings support an association of n-3 LCPUFA from natural sources with depressive symptoms. The availability of fresh seafood in the local diet may represent a protective factor for depression in this setting.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Berger M ; Taylor S ; Harriss L ; Campbell S ; Thompson F ; Jones S ; Makrides M ; Gibson R ; Paul Amminger G; Sarnyai Z ; McDermott R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/1028415X.2018.1504429 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAustralia/epidemiology\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/*blood/epidemiology\r\n*Diet\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/*blood\r\nFeeding Behavior\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\r\n*Seafood\r\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander\r\nDHA\r\nDepression\r\nEPA\r\nOmega-3 fatty acids\r\nPHQ-9\r\nScreening","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Berger M, Taylor S, Harriss L, Campbell S, Thompson F, Jones S, Makrides M, Gibson R, Paul Amminger G, Sarnyai Z, and McDermott R (2020) Cross-sectional association of seafood consumption, polyunsaturated fatty acids and depressive symptoms in two Torres Strait communities..

Although the underlying neurobiological traits for these disorders are not fully understood, a complex interplay between psychological, environmental, and biological factors contributes to their outcomes. Recent advances in lipidomic analysis and artificial intelligence algorithms have improved the identification of selective lipid species modulating the susceptibility to mental disorders. Sphingolipids (SLs) and ceramides-related SLs are among the most abundant lipids species in the brain that support major key pathways during neurodevelopment and brain plasticity. High levels of ceramides in plasma and brain contribute to psychiatric illness susceptibility in humans and animal models. However, the neuropathological mechanism regarding the involvement of ceramides in these disorders remain inconclusive. The brain is highly susceptible to nutritional insults, which could lead to functional impairment and influence the development and progression of psychiatric disorders. While the brain relies on glucose metabolism to support its physiological needs, a selective nutrient formula appears to have greater effects on brain health than others. For instance, consumption of high-energy diets is associated with brain anatomical, physiological, and metabolic changes, including ceramides metabolism. Herein, we will address the contribution of ceramides metabolism as a modulator of major psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. We will also describe molecular and cellular targets of ceramides metabolism assisting the maintenance and progression of psychiatric disorders and their modulation by dietary formulas as non-pharmacologic treatments.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bernal-Vega S ; García-Juárez M ; Camacho-Morales A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/jnc.15759 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nHumans\r\nArtificial Intelligence\r\n*Mental Disorders/metabolism\r\nSphingolipids/metabolism\r\nCeramides/metabolism\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/metabolism\r\nceramides\r\nhigh-energy diets\r\ninflammation\r\npsychiatric disorders\r\nsphingolipids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bernal-Vega S, García-Juárez M, and Camacho-Morales A (2023) Contribution of ceramides metabolism in psychiatric disorders..

Sphingomyelin (SM) is the most abundant SF in the cell, with ubiquitous distribution within mammalian tissues, and particularly high levels in the Central Nervous System (CNS). SM is an essential element of plasma membrane (PM) and its levels are crucial for the cell function. SM content in a cell is strictly regulated by the enzymes of SM metabolic pathways, which activities create a balance between SM synthesis and degradation. The de novo synthesis via SM synthases (SMSs) in the last step of the multi-stage process is the most important pathway of SM formation in a cell. The SM hydrolysis by sphingomyelinases (SMases) increases the concentration of ceramide (Cer), a bioactive molecule, which is involved in cellular proliferation, growth and apoptosis. By controlling the levels of SM and Cer, SMSs and SMases maintain cellular homeostasis. Enzymes of SM cycle exhibit unique properties and diverse tissue distribution. Disturbances in their activities were observed in many CNS pathologies. This review characterizes the physiological roles of SM and enzymes controlling SM levels as well as their involvement in selected pathologies of the Central Nervous System, such as ischemia/hypoxia, Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), depression, schizophrenia and Niemann Pick disease (NPD).","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bienias K ; Fiedorowicz A ; Sadowska A ; Prokopiuk S ; Car H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pharep.2015.12.008 ","Keywords":"Alzheimer Disease/enzymology\r\nAnimals\r\nDepression/enzymology\r\nHumans\r\nNiemann-Pick Diseases/enzymology\r\nParkinson Disease/enzymology\r\nReperfusion Injury/enzymology\r\nSchizophrenia/enzymology\r\nSphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/*metabolism\r\nSphingomyelins/*metabolism\r\nTransferases (Other Substituted Phosphate Groups)/*metabolism\r\nAcid sphingomyelinase\r\nNeutral sphingomyelinase\r\nSphingomyelin\r\nSphingomyelin synthases","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bienias K, Fiedorowicz A, Sadowska A, Prokopiuk S, and Car H (2016) Regulation of sphingomyelin metabolism..

We demonstrated that the treatment of mice with flower EO of the T. minuta reversed the depressive-like behavior induced by stress or inflammatory challenge in mice. This effect is most likely due to the reversal of oxidative stress in the hippocampus of mice, the decrease in plasma corticosterone levels, and restoration of the mRNA levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, protein kinase B, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2. As an outcome, flower EO of the T. minuta has promising antidepressant properties and could be considered for new therapeutic strategies for major depressive disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Birmann PT ; Casaril AM ; Zugno GP ; Acosta GG ; Severo Sabedra Sousa F; Collares T ; Seixas FK ; Jacob RG ; Brüning CA ; Savegnago L ; Hartwig D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.brainres.2022.147845 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nDepression/drug therapy/metabolism\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFlowers/metabolism\r\nHippocampus/metabolism\r\nInflammation/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nMice\r\nMitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism\r\n*Oils, Volatile/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nOxidative Stress\r\nProto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism\r\n*Tagetes/metabolism\r\nBDNF\r\nDepression\r\nEssential oil\r\nMice\r\nNeurogenesis\r\nOxidative stress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Birmann PT, Casaril AM, Zugno GP, Acosta GG, Severo Sabedra Sousa F, Collares T, Seixas FK, Jacob RG, Brüning CA, Savegnago L, and Hartwig D (2022) Flower essential oil of Tagetes minuta mitigates oxidative stress and restores BDNF-Akt/ERK2 signaling attenuating inflammation- and stress-induced depressive-like behavior in mice..

Our primary outcome measure was standardized mean difference in a clinical measure of depression severity. In stratified meta-analysis, we examined the effects of trial duration, trial methodological quality, baseline depression severity, diagnostic indication, dose of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in omega-3 preparations, and whether omega-3 FA was given as monotherapy or augmentation. In 13 randomized, placebo-controlled trials examining the efficacy of omega-3 FAs involving 731 participants, meta-analysis demonstrated no significant benefit of omega-3 FA treatment compared with placebo (standard mean difference (SMD)=0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.04, 0.26). Meta-analysis demonstrated significant heterogeneity and publication bias. Nearly all evidence of omega-3 benefit was removed after adjusting for publication bias using the trim-and-fill method (SMD=0.01, 95% CI: -0.13, 0.15). Secondary analyses suggested a trend toward increased efficacy of omega-3 FAs in trials of lower methodological quality, trials of shorter duration, trials which utilized completers rather than intention-to-treat analysis, and trials in which study participants had greater baseline depression severity. Current published trials suggest a small, non-significant benefit of omega-3 FAs for major depression.

The objective was to search if any pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions have proven to be effective on depressive symptoms after a FEP. METHODS: for this systematic review we systematically searched and screened PubMed for articles published from August 1975 to October 15, 2020, with the terms: treatment AND first-episode psychosis OR post-psychotic OR post-schizophrenic AND depression. RESULTS: we identified 139 articles of which 20 met the inclusion criteria. These interventions were then categorized into four subgroups (antipsychotics, antidepressants, psychological and miscellaneous). LIMITATIONS: this review has several limitations. The reviewed studies were heterogeneous as to assessments, interventions, and samples; furthermore, only one study had PPD in FEP as its primary outcome. CONCLUSIONS: to our knowledge, this is the first review of PPD in a FEP's treatment. PPD continues to be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The available evidence for the use of treatment whether pharmacological or non-pharmacological is limited. However, certain approaches such as online therapy and treatment with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) show promising results. It could be of interest for future studies to focus not only on the treatment of PPD but also on the diagnostic heterogeneity of the sample and the adaptation of the content of the intervention to the individual.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bodoano Sánchez I; Mata Agudo A; Guerrero-Jiménez M ; Girela Serrano B; Álvarez Gil P; Carrillo de Albornoz Calahorro CM; Gutiérrez-Rojas L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/08039488.2022.2067225 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nDepression\r\n*Psychotic Disorders/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy\r\n*Schizophrenia/drug therapy\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nDepression\r\nantidepressants\r\nantipsychotics\r\npost psychotic\r\nschizophrenia","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bodoano Sánchez I, Mata Agudo A, Guerrero-Jiménez M, Girela Serrano B, Álvarez Gil P, Carrillo de Albornoz Calahorro CM, and Gutiérrez-Rojas L (2023) Treatment of post-psychotic depression in first-episode psychosis.

Only studies on cancer cells or cancer patients were included. There is no long lasting effect of aromatherapy massage, while short term improvements were reported for general well being, anxiety and depression up to 8 weeks after treatment. The reviewed studies indicate short-term effects of aromatherapy on depression, anxiety and overall wellbeing. Specifically, some clinical trials found an increase in patient-identified symptom relief, psychological wellbeing and improved sleep. Furthermore, some found a short-term improvement (up to 2 weeks after treatment) in anxiety and depression scores and better pain control. Although essential oils have generally shown minimal adverse effects, potential risks include ingesting large amounts (intentional misuse); local skin irritation, especially with prolonged skin contact; allergic contact dermatitis; and phototoxicity from reaction to sunlight (some oils).

Women with perinatal depression may not receive proper medical treatment because of concerns over teratogenic effects related to drug therapy. Evidence suggests that low levels of omega-3 fatty acids are correlated with depressive symptoms during pregnancy and after delivery. Omega-3 fatty acids may produce antidepressant effects due to their role in serotonin functioning. A literature search identified seven clinical trials of omega-3 fatty acids for the prevention or treatment of perinatal depression. Depression rating scale scores used in the studies improved, but results were statistically significant in only three trials. Four studies were randomized and placebo controlled, and three were open label. One study evaluating the prevention of postpartum depression in women with a history of depression was discontinued early due to relapse of depressive symptoms. In the trials we evaluated, the most common adverse effects were foul breath and/or unpleasant taste, and gastrointestinal complaints; no serious adverse events were reported. The seven studies were limited by small sample sizes and variable dosing and study durations. In the studies that demonstrated statistical significance, improvement in depression rating scale scores for omega-3 fatty acids was comparable to placebo. Overall, results have been inconclusive, but further investigation of omega-3 fatty acids is warranted because they did improve depression scores and appeared to be safe during pregnancy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Borja-Hart NL ; Marino J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1592/phco.30.2.210 ","Keywords":"Clinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/*prevention & control\r\nDietary Supplements/adverse effects\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/*drug therapy\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Borja-Hart NL, and Marino J (2010) Role of omega-3 Fatty acids for prevention or treatment of perinatal depression..

We conducted both in vitro and clinical investigations to test which EPA or DHA metabolites are involved in these anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and antidepressant effects. In vitro, we used the human hippocampal progenitor cell line HPC0A07/03C, and pre-treated cells with either EPA or DHA, followed by interleukin 1beta (IL1β), IL6 and interferon-alpha (IFN-α). Both EPA and DHA prevented the reduction in neurogenesis and the increase in apoptosis induced by these cytokines; moreover, these effects were mediated by the lipoxygenase (LOX) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) EPA/DHA metabolites, 5-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (HEPE), 4-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (HDHA), 18-HEPE, 20-HDHA, 17(18)-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (EpETE) and 19(20)-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid (EpDPA), detected here for the first time in human hippocampal neurones using mass spectrometry lipidomics of the supernatant. In fact, like EPA/DHA, co-treatment with these metabolites prevented cytokines-induced reduction in neurogenesis and apoptosis. Moreover, co-treatment with 17(18)-EpETE and 19(20)-EpDPA and the soluble epoxide hydroxylase (sEH) inhibitor, TPPU (which prevents their conversion into dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (DiHETE)/ dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acid (DiHDPA) metabolites) further enhanced their neurogenic and anti-apoptotic effects. Interestingly, these findings were replicated in a sample of n = 22 patients with a DSM-IV Major Depressive Disorder, randomly assigned to treatment with either EPA (3.0 g/day) or DHA (1.4 g/day) for 12 weeks, with exactly the same LOX and CYP450 lipid metabolites increased in the plasma of these patients following treatment with their precursor, EPA or DHA, and some evidence that higher levels of these metabolites were correlated with less severe depressive symptoms. Overall, our study provides the first evidence for the relevance of LOX- and CYP450-derived EPA/DHA bioactive lipid metabolites as neuroprotective molecular targets for human hippocampal neurogenesis and depression, and highlights the importance of sEH inhibitors as potential therapeutic strategy for patients suffering from depressive symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Borsini A ; Nicolaou A ; Camacho-Muñoz D ; Kendall AC ; Di Benedetto MG ; Giacobbe J ; Su KP ; Pariante CM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41380-021-01160-8 ","Keywords":"Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nDepression\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/pharmacology\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3/metabolism/pharmacology\r\nHippocampus/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nInflammation/metabolism\r\nLipoxygenase/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nNeurogenesis","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Borsini A, Nicolaou A, Camacho-Muñoz D, Kendall AC, Di Benedetto MG, Giacobbe J, Su KP, and Pariante CM (2021) Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids protect against inflammation through production of LOX and CYP450 lipid mediators: relevance for major depression and for human hippocampal neurogenesis..

These outcomes may result from changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, which, in turn, can be modulated by environmental factors, such as nutritional status. In this study, the adult male offspring of dams exposed to restraint stress during the last semester of pregnancy and fed different diets were evaluated for depressive-like behavior in the forced swimming test and for the corticosterone response to the test. Female Wistar rats were allocated to one of three groups: regular diet, diet supplemented with coconut fat or with fish oil, offered during pregnancy and lactation. When pregnancy was confirmed, they were distributed into control or stress groups. Stress consisted of restraint and bright light for 45 min, three times per day, in the last week of pregnancy. The body weight of the adult offspring submitted to PNS was lower than that of controls. In the forced swimming test, time of immobility was reduced and swimming was increased in PNS rats fed fish oil and plasma corticosterone levels immediately after the forced swimming test were lower in PNS rats fed regular diet than their control counterparts; this response was reduced in control rats whose mothers were fed fish oil and coconut fat. The present results indicate that coconut fat and fish oil influenced behavioral and hormonal responses to the forced swimming test in both control and PNS adult male rats.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Borsonelo EC ; Suchecki D ; Galduróz JC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.brainres.2011.02.043 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBiomarkers/blood\r\n*Cocos\r\nCorticosterone/*blood\r\nDepression/*blood/psychology\r\nDietary Fats/administration & dosage\r\nFemale\r\nFish Oils/*administration & dosage\r\nMale\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/blood/diet therapy\r\nPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*blood/diet therapy\r\nRats\r\nStress, Psychological/*blood/diet therapy/psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Borsonelo EC, Suchecki D, and Galduróz JC (2011) Effect of fish oil and coconut fat supplementation on depressive-type behavior and corticosterone levels of prenatally stressed male rats..

However, it is an open question whether this is indeed the case. Therefore, we reviewed the evidence for effects of ω-3 LC-PUFA on human brain morphology and function. We included studies on (1) naturalistic long-term ω-3 LC-PUFA intake during life (2) the effects of short-term ω-3 LC-PUFA supplementation in healthy subjects and (3) the effects of ω-3 LC-PUFA supplementation as alternative or add-on treatment for psychiatric or neurological disorders. To date, 24 studies have been published on the effect of ω-3 LC-PUFA on brain function and structure. Findings from naturalistic studies and clinical trials in healthy individuals indicate that ω-3 LC-PUFA intake may be associated with increased functional activation of the prefrontal cortex in children, and greater gray matter volume and white matter integrity during aging. However, most naturalistic studies were cross-sectional or did not find any effect on cognition. As such, it is hard to estimate the magnitude of any beneficial effects. Furthermore, there is only limited evidence to support that ω-3 LC-PUFA supplementation is beneficial in brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder and schizophrenia. Overall, the literature suggests that sensitivity to supplementation may vary over development, and as a consequence of brain disorders. The biological mechanisms underlying any (beneficial) effects ω-3 LC-PUFAs on the brain are currently unknown and need to be investigated.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bos DJ ; van Montfort SJ ; Oranje B ; Durston S ; Smeets PA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.euroneuro.2015.12.031 ","Keywords":"Brain/*anatomy & histology/*physiology\r\nBrain Diseases/pathology/physiopathology/prevention & control\r\nDatabases, Bibliographic/statistics & numerical data\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nBrain function\r\nBrain morphology\r\nDHA\r\nDevelopment\r\nEPA\r\nOmega-3","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bos DJ, van Montfort SJ, Oranje B, Durston S, and Smeets PA (2016) Effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on human brain morphology and function: What is the evidence?.

This multicenter dietary intervention was shown to reduce inflammation in older people. This was the main outcome. Here, we describe the effects on HRQoL, anxiety, and depressive symptoms according to inflammation status. Overall, 125 healthy older subjects (65-80 year) were recruited (Italy, France, and Germany) and randomized into four arms (A, Healthy diet (HD); B, HD plus De Simone Formulation probiotic blend; C, HD plus AISA d-Limonene; D, HD plus Argan oil). The HD was weight maintaining, rich in antioxidant vitamins, polyphenols, polyunsaturated fatty acids (n6: n3 ratio = 3:1), and fiber. Data on inflammatory parameters, mental (MCS) and physical (PCS) component summaries of HRQoL (SF-36), anxiety symptoms (STAI state), and depressive symptoms (CES-D) were collected before and after 56 days of intervention. Body fat mass proportion (BFM) was considered a co-variable. A decrease of CES-D score was seen in the four arms (A: -40.0%, p = 0.001; B: -32.5%, p = 0.023; C: -42.8%, p = 0.004; and D: -33.3%, p = 0.21). Within the subgroups of subjects with medium/high inflammation a similar decrease in CES-D score occurred in all groups (A: -44.8%, p = 0.021; B, -46.7%, p = 0.024; C, -52.2%, p = 0.039; D, -43.8%, p = 0.037). The effect of interventions on CES-D was not related to baseline inflammation. MCS-HRQoL improved in A and C. There was no change in anxiety or PCS-HRQoL. In this trial with no control group, a decrease in depressive symptoms in healthy older volunteers was observed after a 2-month healthy diet intervention, independently of inflammation but with possible limitations due to participation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bourdel-Marchasson I ; Ostan R ; Regueme SC ; Pinto A ; Pryen F ; Charrouf Z ; d'Alessio P ; Baudron CR ; Guerville F ; Durrieu J ; Donini LM ; Franceschi C ; Valentini L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu12030800 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nDepression/*diet therapy\r\n*Diet, Healthy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\n*Quality of Life\r\ndepressive symptoms\r\ninflammaging\r\nnutraceuticals\r\nquality of life","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bourdel-Marchasson I, Ostan R, Regueme SC, Pinto A, Pryen F, Charrouf Z, d'Alessio P, Baudron CR, Guerville F, Durrieu J, Donini LM, Franceschi C, and Valentini L (2020) Quality of Life: Psychological Symptoms-Effects of a 2-Month Healthy Diet and Nutraceutical Intervention; A Randomized, Open-Label Intervention Trial (RISTOMED)..

In fact, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is one for the major building structures of membrane phospholipids of brain and absolute necessary of neuronal function. It was first demonstrated that the differentiation and functioning of cultured brain cells requires not only ALA, but also the very long polyunsaturated omega-3 (DHA) and omega-6 carbon chains. Then, it was found that ALA acid deficiency alters the course of brain development, perturbs the composition of brain cell membranes, neurones, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, as well as sub cellular particles such as myelin, nerve endings (synaptosomes) and mitochondria. These alterations induce physicochemical modifications in membranes, lead to biochemical and physiological perturbations, and results in neurosensory and behavioural upset. Consequently, the nature of polyunsaturated fatty acids (in particular omega-3, ALA and DHA) present in formula milks for infants (premature and term) conditions the visual, neurological and cerebral abilities, including intellectual. Dietary omega-3 fatty acids are involved in the prevention of some aspects of ischemic cardiovascular disease (including at the level of cerebral vascularization), and in some neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly depression, as well as in dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. The implication of omega-3 fatty acids in major depression and bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness) is under evaluation. Their dietary deficiency (and altered hepatic metabolism) can prevent the renewal of membranes and consequently accelerate cerebral ageing; nonetheless, the respective roles of the vascular component on one hand and the cerebral parenchyma itself on the other have not yet been clearly elucidated. Low fat diet may have adverse effects on mood. The nature of the amino acid composition of dietary proteins contributes to cerebral function; taking into account that tryptophan plays a special role. In fact, some indispensable amino acids present in dietary proteins participate to elaborate neurotransmitters (and neuromodulators). The regulation of glycaemia (thanks to the ingestion of food with a low glycaemic index ensuring a low insulin level) improves the quality and duration of intellectual performance, if only because at rest the brain consumes more than 50% of dietary carbohydrates, approximately 80% of which are used only for energy purpose. In infants, adults and aged, as well as in diabetes, poorer glycaemic control is associated with lower performances, for instance on tests of memory. At all ages, and more specifically in aged people, some cognitive functions appear sensitive to short term variations in glucose availability. The presence of dietary fibbers is associated with higher alertness ratings and ensures less perceived stress. Although an increasing number of genetic factors that may affect the risk of neurodegenerative disorders are being identified, number of findings show that dietary factors play major roles in determining whether the brain age successfully of experiences neurodegenerative disorders.

Accordingly, we have previously shown that central Aβ injection is able to elicit depressive-like phenotype in male rats. In the present study, we reproduced for the first time the Aβ-induced depressive-like model in female rats, evaluating behavioural and neurochemical outcomes. Moreover, we studied the effect of lifelong exposure to either n-3 PUFA enriched or n-3 PUFA deficient diet, in female rats, both intact and after central Aβ administration. Our results confirmed the Aβ-induced depressive-like profile also in female rats. Moreover, chronic exposure to n-3 PUFA deficient diet led to highly negative alterations in behavioural and neurochemical parameters, while lifelong exposure to n-3 PUFA enriched diet was able to restore the Aβ-induced depressive-like profile in female rats. In conclusion, the Aβ-induced depressive-like profile was reversed by n-3 PUFA supplementation, indicating a possible therapeutic role of n-3 PUFA in the treatment of the burden of depressive disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bove M ; Mhillaj E ; Tucci P ; Giardino I ; Schiavone S ; Morgese MG ; Trabace L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bcp.2018.07.017 ","Keywords":"Amyloid beta-Peptides/administration & dosage/*toxicity\r\nAnimals\r\nDepression/*chemically induced/*diet therapy/metabolism\r\nDietary Fats, Unsaturated/administration & dosage\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage/*deficiency\r\nFemale\r\nInjections, Intraventricular\r\nLipids/*deficiency\r\nPeptide Fragments/administration & dosage/*toxicity\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nDepressive-like profile\r\nFemale rats\r\nPUFA\r\nSoluble amyloid beta","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bove M, Mhillaj E, Tucci P, Giardino I, Schiavone S, Morgese MG, and Trabace L (2018) Effects of n-3 PUFA enriched and n-3 PUFA deficient diets in naïve and Aβ-treated female rats..

This indication is supported by data of neurobiological research, as highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) are highly concentrated in neural phospholipids and are important components of the neuronal cell membrane. They modulate the mechanisms of brain cell signaling, including the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways. The aim of this review is to provide a complete and updated account of the empirical evidence of the efficacy and safety that are currently available for omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. The main evidence for the effectiveness of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been obtained in mood disorders, in particular in the treatment of depressive symptoms in unipolar and bipolar depression. There is some evidence to support the use of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of conditions characterized by a high level of impulsivity and aggression and borderline personality disorders. In patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, small-to-modest effects of omega-3 HUFAs have been found. The most promising results have been reported by studies using high doses of EPA or the association of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. In schizophrenia, current data are not conclusive and do not allow us either to refuse or support the indication of omega-3 fatty acids. For the remaining psychiatric disturbances, including autism spectrum disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders and substance use disorder, the data are too scarce to draw any conclusion. Concerning tolerability, several studies concluded that omega-3 can be considered safe and well tolerated at doses up to 5 g/day.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bozzatello P ; Brignolo E ; De Grandi E ; Bellino S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/jcm5080067 ","Keywords":"attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\r\nborderline personality disorder\r\neating disorders\r\nmood disorders\r\nomega-3 fatty acids\r\npolyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nschizophrenia\r\nsubstance use disorder\r\ntolerability","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bozzatello P, Brignolo E, De Grandi E, and Bellino S (2016) Supplementation with Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Psychiatric Disorders: A Review of Literature Data..

The present article is an update of a previous systematic review and is aimed to provide a complete report of data published in the period between 1980 and 2019 on efficacy and tolerability of omega-3 fatty acids in psychiatric disorders. In July 2019, an electronic search on PUBMED, Medline and PsychINFO of all RCTs, systematic reviews and meta-analyses on omega-3 fatty acids and psychiatric disorders without any filter or MESH restriction was performed. After eligibility processes, the final number of records included in this review was 126. One hundred and two of these studies were RCTs, while 24 were reviews and meta-analyses. The role of omega-3 fatty acids was studied in schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders, eating disorders, substance use disorder and borderline personality disorder. The main evidence of the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids has been obtained in treating depressive symptoms in patients with major depression and, to a lesser degree, bipolar depression. Some efficacy was also found in early phases of schizophrenia in addition to antipsychotic treatment, but not in the chronic phases of psychosis. Small beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids were observed in ADHD and positive results were reported in a few trials on core symptoms of borderline personality disorder. For other psychiatric disorders results are inconsistent.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bozzatello P ; Rocca P ; Mantelli E ; Bellino S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ijms20215257 ","Keywords":"Fatty Acids, Omega-3/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nMeta-Analysis as Topic\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nadverse effects\r\nefficacy\r\nomega-3 fatty acids\r\npolyunsaturated fatty acids\r\npsychiatric disorders\r\nrandomized controlled trials","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bozzatello P, Rocca P, Mantelli E, and Bellino S (2019) Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids: What is Their Role in Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders?.

In recent decades, researchers have confirmed the central role of PUFAs in a variety of patho-physiological processes. These agents modulate the mechanisms of brain cell signalling including the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways. Therefore, nutritional insufficiencies of PUFAs may have adverse effects on brain development and developmental outcomes. The role of n-3 PUFAs has been studied in several psychiatric disorders in adulthood: schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders, eating disorders, substance use disorder, and borderline personality disorder. In contrast to the great number of studies conducted in adults, there are only limited data on the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation in children and adolescents who suffer from mental disorders or show a high risk of developing psychiatric disorders. The aim of this review is to provide a complete and updated account of the available evidence of the impact of polyunsaturated fatty acids on developmental psychopathology in children and adolescents and the effect of fatty acid supplementation during developmental milestones, particularly in high-risk populations of children with minimal but detectable signs or symptoms of mental disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bozzatello P ; Blua C ; Rocca P ; Bellino S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/biomedicines9080850 ","Keywords":"adolescence\r\nanxiety disorders\r\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder\r\nborderline personality disorder\r\nchildhood\r\nmood disorders\r\npolyunsaturated fatty acids\r\npsychiatric disorders\r\nschizophrenia\r\nsubstance use disorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bozzatello P, Blua C, Rocca P, and Bellino S (2021) Mental Health in Childhood and Adolescence: The Role of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids..

Although associations between diet, obesity and the related metabolic syndrome (MetS), stress, and mental disorders exist, causal pathways have not been established. METHODS: We reviewed the literature on the relationship between diet, stress, obesity and psychiatric disorders related to stress. RESULTS: Diet and obesity can affect mood through direct effects, or stress-related mental disorders could lead to changes in diet habits that affect weight. Alternatively, common factors such as stress or predisposition could lead to both obesity and stress-related mental disorders, such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Specific aspects of diet can lead to acute changes in mood as well as stimulate inflammation, which has led to efforts to assess polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) as a treatment for depression. Bidirectional relationships between these different factors are also likely. Finally, there has been increased attention recently on the relationship between the gut and the brain, with the realization that the gut microbiome has an influence on brain function and probably also mood and behavior, introducing another way diet can influence mental health and disorders. Brain areas and neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that are involved in both mood and appetite likely play a role in mediating this relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the relationship between diet, stress and mood and behavior could have important implications for the treatment of both stress-related mental disorders and obesity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bremner JD ; Moazzami K ; Wittbrodt MT ; Nye JA ; Lima BB ; Gillespie CF ; Rapaport MH ; Pearce BD ; Shah AJ ; Vaccarino V ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu12082428 ","Keywords":"Affect/physiology\r\nBrain/metabolism/microbiology\r\nDepression/diet therapy/etiology/metabolism\r\nDiet/*psychology\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/pharmacology\r\nGastrointestinal Microbiome/physiology\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/etiology/*metabolism\r\n*Mental Health\r\nNeuropeptides/metabolism\r\nNeurotransmitter Agents/metabolism\r\nObesity/metabolism/psychology\r\nStress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/diet therapy/etiology/*metabolism\r\nStress, Psychological/diet therapy/etiology/*metabolism\r\nMediterranean diet\r\nbrain\r\ncardiovascular disease\r\nchild abuse\r\ncoronary artery disease\r\ndepressive disorder\r\ndiet\r\ngalanin\r\nghrelin\r\nmetabolic syndrome\r\nmicrobiome\r\nmyocardial ischemia\r\nnutrition\r\nobesity\r\nposttraumatic\r\nserotonin\r\nsomatostatin\r\nstress disorders","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bremner JD, Moazzami K, Wittbrodt MT, Nye JA, Lima BB, Gillespie CF, Rapaport MH, Pearce BD, Shah AJ, and Vaccarino V (2020) Diet, Stress and Mental Health..

Recent epidemiological studies with greater samples and longer follow-up periods, however, have even shown a positive correlation between cholesterol concentrations and suicide risk after controlling for potential confounding variables. A meta-analysis of earlier intervention trials suggested that cholesterol lowering could cause or worsen depressive symptoms and increase the risk of suicide. Large trials of statins (simvastatin, lovastatin, and pravastatin) did not show an increase of suicide mortality. The aim of this selective review is to critically discuss the current evidence for a potential link between cholesterol, essential fatty acids, depression, suicide, impulsivity, and aggression. Preclinical data support the hypothesis that cholesterol reduction may contribute to the serotonergic abnormalities that have been postulated in suicidal subjects. Recently, it was hypothesised that a decreased consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially omega-3 fatty acids, may be a risk factor for depression and suicide. Currently, we do not have sufficient evidence that cholesterol-lowering therapies increase the risk of depression and suicide. Increasing the dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids may increase central serotonergic activity and reduce impulsive and aggressive behaviours.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Brunner J ; Parhofer KG ; Schwandt P ; Bronisch T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1055/s-2002-19834 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nCholesterol/*metabolism\r\nDepression/epidemiology/*metabolism\r\nFatty Acids, Essential/*metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nRisk Factors\r\n*Suicide","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Brunner J, Parhofer KG, Schwandt P, and Bronisch T (2002) Cholesterol, essential fatty acids, and suicide..

Fish oil is known to have many beneficial side effects, and clinical trials demonstrate that supplementation with fish oil is beneficial in the management of depression. Fish oil contains omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and there are several mechanisms by which PUFAs are thought to induce an antidepressant effect, including anti-inflammatory action and direct effects on membrane properties. This review will analyze and evaluate the clinical trials surrounding fish oil use in the treatment of depression, and will also review the likely sites of action of PUFAs at the cell membrane with special attention being placed on lipid rafts and G-proteins.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Burhani MD ; Rasenick MM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3233/JIN-170072 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nDepressive Disorder/*diet therapy/metabolism\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFish Oils/*administration & dosage/chemistry\r\nHumans\r\nG-protein\r\nGPCR\r\nantidepressant\r\ncAMP\r\ndepression\r\nlipid raft\r\nomega-3 fatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Burhani MD, and Rasenick MM (2017) Fish oil and depression: The skinny on fats..

Nurturing a beneficial gut microbiome with prebiotics, such as fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), is an appealing but underinvestigated microbiota manipulation. Here we tested whether chronic prebiotic treatment modifies behavior across domains relevant to anxiety, depression, cognition, stress response, and social behavior. METHODS: C57BL/6J male mice were administered FOS, GOS, or a combination of FOS+GOS for 3 weeks prior to testing. Plasma corticosterone, microbiota composition, and cecal short-chain fatty acids were measured. In addition, FOS+GOS- or water-treated mice were also exposed to chronic psychosocial stress, and behavior, immune, and microbiota parameters were assessed. RESULTS: Chronic prebiotic FOS+GOS treatment exhibited both antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. Moreover, the administration of GOS and the FOS+GOS combination reduced stress-induced corticosterone release. Prebiotics modified specific gene expression in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. Regarding short-chain fatty acid concentrations, prebiotic administration increased cecal acetate and propionate and reduced isobutyrate concentrations, changes that correlated significantly with the positive effects seen on behavior. Moreover, FOS+GOS reduced chronic stress-induced elevations in corticosterone and proinflammatory cytokine levels and depression-like and anxiety-like behavior in addition to normalizing the effects of stress on the microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data strongly suggest a beneficial role of prebiotic treatment for stress-related behaviors. These findings strengthen the evidence base supporting therapeutic targeting of the gut microbiota for brain-gut axis disorders, opening new avenues in the field of nutritional neuropsychopharmacology.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Burokas A ; Arboleya S ; Moloney RD ; Peterson VL ; Murphy K ; Clarke G ; Stanton C ; Dinan TG ; Cryan JF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopsych.2016.12.031 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnti-Anxiety Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety/blood/etiology/*therapy\r\nBrain/drug effects/metabolism\r\nCorticosterone/blood\r\nDepression/blood/etiology/*therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nGastrointestinal Microbiome/drug effects\r\nGastrointestinal Tract/drug effects/metabolism\r\nGene Expression/drug effects\r\nLocomotion/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nNeurotransmitter Agents/blood\r\nNociception/drug effects\r\nOligosaccharides/*therapeutic use\r\n*Prebiotics\r\nStress, Psychological/complications\r\nTryptophan/blood\r\nAnimal behavior\r\nAnxiety\r\nMicrobiota-gut-brain axis\r\nPrebiotics\r\nSCFAs\r\nStress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Burokas A, Arboleya S, Moloney RD, Peterson VL, Murphy K, Clarke G, Stanton C, Dinan TG, and Cryan JF (2017) Targeting the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: Prebiotics Have Anxiolytic and Antidepressant-like Effects and Reverse the Impact of Chronic Stress in Mice..

Preventive interventions on neuroinflammation seem to be able to interfere with neurodegeneration. Supplementation of essential nutrients, such as long-chain-polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin E and mineral elements, may minimize inflammation, enhancing antioxidative defense, and lowering the risk and incidence of age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. This manuscript reviews the current evidence on the role of neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative and mental disorders, and preventive strategies for food supplementation in these neuropsychiatric diseases. Dietary supplementation-based strategies have been demonstrated to be effective in subjects with mild cognitive impairment, while weaker results have been obtained in patients with advance neurodegenerative disease. Adjunctive supplementation has also been demonstrated to improve depression, this being of marked benefit considering the comorbidity between cognitive impairment/dementia and depression. Further research is needed to improve the prescriptive precision of supplementation in patients, and to better understand potential interactions with clinical and pharmacokinetic factors.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Businaro R ; Vauzour D ; Sarris J ; Münch G ; Gyengesi E ; Brogelli L ; Zuzarte P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fnut.2021.669846 ","Keywords":"brain health\r\ndepression\r\ndiet\r\ngut-brain axis\r\nneuroinflammation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Businaro R, Vauzour D, Sarris J, Münch G, Gyengesi E, Brogelli L, and Zuzarte P (2021) Therapeutic Opportunities for Food Supplements in Neurodegenerative Disease and Depression..

In this chapter, a series of compounds showing clinical potent in the treatment of MDD has been reviewed based on their reported results from different phase clinical trials. Although the majority of these strategies currently only lead to a systematic approach in the aspects of treatment resistant depression, some of them would be a routine clinical practice which is usable in the treatment of MDD, such as ketamine. Additionally, beyond the mechanism of action for novel therapeutic molecules involving glutamatergic, opiate, cholinergic receptors, and neuroplasticity, some supplemental procedures such as polyunsaturated fatty acids were also included in this chapter due to their solid property against MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cai M ; Wang H ; Zhang X ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/978-981-32-9271-0_15 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*therapy\r\nHumans\r\nAnti-inflammation\r\nKetamine\r\nNeurotransmitters\r\nNovel pharmacological antidepressants","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cai M, Wang H, and Zhang X (2019) Potential Anti-Depressive Treatment Maneuvers from Bench to Bedside..

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of 4 weeks of oral supplementation with a fractionated marine lipid concentration, standardized to 17-HDHA and 18-HEPE, on health-related quality of life and inflammation in adults with chronic pain. METHODS: This study was a prospective, non-randomized, open-label clinical trial. Forty-four adults with ≥ moderate pain intensity for at least 3 months were recruited. The primary outcome was change in health-related quality of life (QOL) using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-43 Profile (PROMIS-43) and the American Chronic Pain Association (ACPA) QOL scale. Exploratory outcomes assessed safety and tolerability, changes in anxiety and depression, levels of pain intensity and interference, patient satisfaction, and impression of change. Changes in blood biomarkers of inflammation (hs-CRP and ESR) were also explored. RESULTS: Outcome measures were collected at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 4 (primary endpoint). At Week 4, PROMIS-43 QOL subdomains changed with significance from baseline (p < 0.05), with borderline changes in the ACPA Quality of Life scale (p < 0.052). Exploratory analyses revealed significant changes (p < 0.05) in all measures of pain intensity, pain interference, depression, and anxiety. There were no statistically significant changes in either hs-CRP or ESR, which stayed within normal limits. CONCLUSION: We conclude that oral supplementation with a fractionated marine lipid concentration standardized to 17-HDHA and 18-HEPE may improve quality of life, reduce pain intensity and interference, and improve mood within 4 weeks in adults with chronic pain. The consistency and magnitude of these results support the need for placebo-controlled clinical trials of marine lipid concentrations standardized to 17-HDHA and 18-HEPE.

This study assessed the effectiveness of a traditional Brazilian diet (DieTBra) and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on the symptoms of anxiety and depression in severe obese participants. METHOD: This was a parallel randomized clinical trial in adults with severe obesity (Body Mass Index - BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2)), DietBra Trial. Participants were randomized into three intervention groups in a ratio of 1: 1: 1 and followed up for 12 weeks. The three intervention groups were: 1) DieTBra, 2) 52 mL/day EVOO, and 3) DieTBra +52 mL/day EVOO. The symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The outcome variables were: anxiety, depression and simultaneous anxiety and depression in the same individual. RESULTS: 149 severe obese individuals were randomized. The mean BMI was 46.3 ± 6.5 kg/m(2) with a mean age of 38.9 ± 8.7 years. After randomization, individuals on medication for depression and anxiety were excluded, totaling 129 at baseline, with 44:43:42 per group. At the end of 12 weeks 113 individuals completed the study. There was a significant reduction of symptoms for the three groups: EVOO, DieTBra and DieTBra + EVOO, respectively: anxiety 38.23% (p = 0.019), 45.83% (p=<0.014), 33.33% (p < 0.013) depression 55.17% (p=<0.001), 50.00% (p=<0.007), 34.61% (p=<0.035), and anxiety/depression 57.69% (p=<0.001), 66.67% (p=<0.014), 27.78% (p=<0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Both DieTBra and olive oil interventions were effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in severe obese adults.

However, the factors that affect the DHA concentration in breast milk have not been completely clarified. Objective: This study aimed to characterize the composition of breast milk fatty acids and to identify maternal factors associated with breast milk DHA concentration in postpartum women in Wuhan, China. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed milk fatty acids in 115 lactating women at 30-120 days postpartum using GC-MS. Maternal sociodemographic, health and other information were collected using a self-reported questionnaire. Maternal dietary intake information was collected through a 24-hour dietary recall method. Postpartum depression status was identified using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: The mean DHA proportion in breast milk was 0.49%. The multivariate regression model showed that the milk DHA proportion was positively associated with maternal aquatic product intake (β = 0.183, 95%CI: 0.052, 0.314) and DHA supplement use (β = 0.146, 95%CI: 0.108, 0.185), and negatively associated with postpartum depression status (β = -0.122, 95%CI: -0.243, -0.002) after adjustment for several maternal and infant factors. Conclusion: Increasing maternal aquatic product intake and DHA supplement use and improving postpartum depression status may increase DHA concentration in breast milk in lactating women.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cao Y ; Wei Q ; Zou L ; Jiang S ; Deng H ; Jiang C ; Cui N ; Huang S ; Ge Y ; Li Y ; Tan L ; Guo S ; Wang S ; Zhou L ; Hao L ; Xu K ; Yang X ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1039/d2fo03129a ","Keywords":"Infant\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\n*Milk, Human\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids\r\nLactation\r\n*Depression, Postpartum/epidemiology\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression\r\nPostpartum Period\r\nEating\r\nFatty Acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cao Y, Wei Q, Zou L, Jiang S, Deng H, Jiang C, Cui N, Huang S, Ge Y, Li Y, Tan L, Guo S, Wang S, Zhou L, Hao L, Xu K, and Yang X (2023) Postpartum dietary intake, depression and the concentration of docosahexaenoic acid in mature breast milk in Wuhan, China..

Supplementation with fish oil rich docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA) during critical periods of development produces antidepressant effects by increasing serotonergic neurotransmission, particularly in the hippocampus. In a previous study, the involvement of 5-HT1A receptors was demonstrated and we hypothesized that fish oil supplementation (from conception to weaning) alters the function of post-synaptic hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors. To test this hypothesis, female rats were supplemented with fish oil during habituation, mating, gestation, and lactation. The adult male offspring was maintained without supplementation until 3 months of age, when they were subjected to the modified forced swimming test (MFST) after infusion of vehicle or the selective 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY100635, and frequency of swimming, immobility, and climbing was recorded for 5 min. After the behavioral test, the hippocampi were obtained for quantification of serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and for 5-HT1A receptor expression by Western blotting analysis. Fish oil-supplemented offspring displayed less depressive-like behaviors in the MFST reflected by decreased immobility and increased swimming and higher 5-HT hippocampal levels. Although there was no difference in the expression of hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors, intra-hippocampal infusion of a sub-effective dose of 8-OH-DPAT enhanced the antidepressant effect of fish oil in supplemented animals. In summary, the present findings suggest that the antidepressant-like effects of fish oil supplementation are likely related to increased hippocampal serotonergic neurotransmission and sensitization of hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Carabelli B ; Delattre AM ; Pudell C ; Mori MA ; Suchecki D ; Machado RB ; Venancio DP ; Piazzetta SR ; Hammerschmidt I ; Zanata SM ; Lima MM ; Zanoveli JM ; Ferraz AC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s12035-014-8849-8 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBlotting, Western\r\nChromatography, High Pressure Liquid\r\nFemale\r\nFish Oils/*pharmacology\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/*metabolism\r\nImmobilization\r\nMale\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nReceptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A/*metabolism\r\nSwimming\r\nSynapses/drug effects/*metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Carabelli B, Delattre AM, Pudell C, Mori MA, Suchecki D, Machado RB, Venancio DP, Piazzetta SR, Hammerschmidt I, Zanata SM, Lima MM, Zanoveli JM, and Ferraz AC (2015) The Antidepressant-Like Effect of Fish Oil: Possible Role of Ventral Hippocampal 5-HT1A Post-synaptic Receptor..

METHODS: Animals were supplemented for 50 days with 3.0 g/kg of Fish Oil (FO) or received water (Control group - C), via gavage. At the end of this period, both groups were injected with LPS 24 h before the modified forced swim test (MFST) and the open field. To assess the possible involvement of IDO in the FO effects, we performed two independent experiments, using two IDO inhibitors: the direct inhibitor 1-methyl-DL-tryptophan (1-MT) and the anti-inflammatory drug minocycline (MINO), administered 23 h, 5 h and 1 h before the tests. After the tests, the animals' hippocampi were removed for quantification of serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) by HPLC, and for IDO expression by western blot. RESULTS: LPS induced a depressive-like state in the animals, and this effect was blocked by 1-MT, MINO and FO. Regardless of IDO inhibition, FO supplemented animals displayed an antidepressant-like response by increasing swimming and decreasing immobility frequencies in the MFST when compared to the control group. The immune challenge induced an over-expression of IDO and reduced hippocampal 5-HT levels, both of which were reversed by MINO and FO. CONCLUSION: FO induced a pronounced antidepressant-like effect and prevented LPS-induced depressive-like behavior, and this effect was related to decreased IDO expression and increased 5-HT levels in the hippocampus.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Carabelli B ; Delattre AM ; Waltrick APF ; Araújo G ; Suchecki D ; Machado RB ; de Souza LER ; Zanata SM ; Zanoveli JM ; Ferraz AC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2020.112675 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnti-Inflammatory Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nDepression/chemically induced/*metabolism/*prevention & control\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/pharmacology\r\nFish Oils/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nHippocampus/*drug effects/*metabolism\r\n*Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/antagonists & inhibitors/drug \r\n      effects/metabolism\r\nLipopolysaccharides/pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMinocycline/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSerotonin/*metabolism\r\nTryptophan/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\n1-MT\r\nDepression\r\nLipopolysaccharide\r\nMinocycline\r\nOmega-3","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Carabelli B, Delattre AM, Waltrick APF, Araújo G, Suchecki D, Machado RB, de Souza LER, Zanata SM, Zanoveli JM, and Ferraz AC (2020) Fish-oil supplementation decreases Indoleamine-2,3-Dioxygenase expression and increases hippocampal serotonin levels in the LPS depression model..

DHA is found in significant amounts in the retinal and neuronal cell membranes due to its high fluidity. Indeed, DHA is selectively concentrated in the synaptic and retinal membranes. DHA is deemed to display anti-inflammatory properties and to reduce the risk of CVD. Consumption of larger amounts of DHA appears to reduce the risk of depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and mood disorders. Conversely, it has been shown that loss of DHA from the nerve cell membrane leads to dysfunction of the central nervous system in the form of anxiety, irritability, susceptibility to stress, dyslexia, impaired memory and cognitive functions, and extended reaction times. DHA plays an important role in ensuring a healthy ageing, by thwarting macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, and other brain disorders at the same time as enhancing memory and strengthening neuroprotection in general. A reduced level of DHA is associated with cognitive decline during ageing. Different mechanisms for this fundamental DHA role have been put forward. Namely, neuroprotectin D1, a DHA derivative, may support brain cell survival and repair through neurotrophic, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory signalling. Many of the effects of DHA on the neurological system may be related to signalling connections, thus leading to the study of the related signalolipidomics. Therefore, the present review will focus on the influence of DHA deficiency upon ageing, with specific emphasis upon neurological disorders related to cognitive function and mental health.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cardoso C ; Afonso C ; Bandarra NM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S0954422416000184 ","Keywords":"*Aging\r\n*Alzheimer Disease\r\n*Cognition\r\nCognitive Aging\r\nDiet\r\n*Docosahexaenoic Acids\r\nHumans\r\nAD Alzheimer’s disease\r\nALA α-linolenic acid\r\nFA fatty acid\r\nMCI mild cognitive impairment\r\nNPD1 neuroprotectin D1\r\nNeuroPs neuroprostanes\r\nPC phosphatidylcholine\r\nPL phospholipid\r\nRCT randomised controlled trial\r\nRDI recommended daily intake\r\nβ-APP β-amyloid precursor protein\r\nAgeing\r\nCognitive disorders\r\nDHA\r\nMarine sources\r\nMental health","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cardoso C, Afonso C, and Bandarra NM (2016) Dietary DHA and health: cognitive function ageing..

We showed previously that cytidine, which increases phospholipid synthesis, has antidepressant-like effects in the forced swim test (FST) in rats, a model used in depression research. Because cytidine and uridine both stimulate synthesis of cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline, a critical substrate for phospholipid synthesis), we examined whether uridine would also produce antidepressant-like effects in rats. We also examined the effects of omega-3 fatty acids (OMG), which increase membrane fluidity and reportedly have antidepressant effects in humans, alone and in combination with uridine. METHODS: We first examined the effects of uridine injections alone and dietary supplementation with OMG alone in the FST. We then combined sub-effective treatment regimens of uridine and OMG to determine whether these agents would be more effective if administered together. RESULTS: Uridine dose-dependently reduced immobility in the FST, an antidepressant-like effect. Dietary supplementation with OMG reduced immobility when given for 30 days, but not for 3 or 10 days. A sub-effective dose of uridine reduced immobility in rats given sub-effective dietary supplementation with OMG. CONCLUSIONS: Uridine and OMG each have antidepressant-like effects in rats. Less of each agent is required for effectiveness when the treatments are administered together.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Carlezon WA Jr; Mague SD ; Parow AM ; Stoll AL ; Cohen BM ; Renshaw PF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopsych.2004.11.038 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nDepression/diet therapy/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Administration Routes\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage\r\nImmobility Response, Tonic/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nReaction Time/drug effects\r\nSwimming/*psychology\r\nTime Factors\r\nUridine/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Carlezon WA Jr, Mague SD, Parow AM, Stoll AL, Cohen BM, and Renshaw PF (2005) Antidepressant-like effects of uridine and omega-3 fatty acids are potentiated by combined treatment in rats..

Low intake of omega-3 FAs is associated with depression and with low HRV, and all three are associated with an increased risk of death in patients with CHD. METHODS: Thirty-six depressed patients with CHD randomized to receive 50 mg of sertraline and 2 g of omega-3/day, and 36 randomized to sertraline and a placebo, had 24-hour HRV measured at baseline and after 10 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: There was a significant treatment × time interaction for covariate adjusted lnVLF (p = .009), for mean 24-hour HR (p = .03), and for 1-minute resting HR (p = .02). The interaction was not significant for three other measures of HRV. LnVLF did not change over time in the omega-3 arm but decreased in the placebo arm (p = .002), suggesting that omega-3 may have prevented or slowed deterioration in cardiac autonomic function. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of omega-3 FAs on lnVLF and HR, although modest, were detected after only 10 weeks of treatment with 2 g per day of omega-3. Whether a longer course of treatment or a higher dose of omega-3 would further decrease HR, improve other indices of HRV, or reduce mortality in depressed CHD patients should be investigated.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Carney RM ; Freedland KE ; Stein PK ; Steinmeyer BC ; Harris WS ; Rubin EH ; Krone RJ ; Rich MW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181eff148 ","Keywords":"Circadian Rhythm/drug effects\r\nComorbidity\r\nCoronary Disease/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*epidemiology\r\nDepressive Disorder/diagnosis/*epidemiology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nElectrocardiography, Ambulatory/drug effects/statistics & numerical data\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHeart Rate/*drug effects\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMyocardial Infarction/diagnosis/drug therapy\r\nPlacebos\r\nSertraline/therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Carney RM, Freedland KE, Stein PK, Steinmeyer BC, Harris WS, Rubin EH, Krone RJ, and Rich MW (2010) Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on heart rate variability in depressed patients with coronary heart disease..

However, clinical trials have produced mixed results. The purpose of this secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial was to determine whether baseline blood levels of omega-3, which are known to vary widely among individuals, predict depression outcomes. METHOD: The percentages of EPA, DHA, and the omega-6 arachidonic acid (AA) were measured in RBCs at baseline and posttreatment in 122 participants with DSM-IV major depression who were randomly assigned between May 2005 and December 2008 to receive either 50 mg/d of sertraline and a daily dosage of 930 mg EPA/750 mg DHA or sertraline plus placebo. Associations between baseline omega-3 RBC levels and remission of depression (17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score ≤ 7) were analyzed by treatment arm. RESULTS: Among participants in the omega-3 arm, baseline RBC levels of EPA + DHA (P = .002) and the EPA + DHA:AA ratio (P = .003) were significantly higher among those whose depression subsequently remitted compared with those whose depression did not remit. No associations were detected in the sertraline plus placebo arm. Baseline levels of EPA (P = .03) and the EPA + DHA:AA ratio (P = .04) moderated the relationship between treatment arm and depression outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: High baseline RBC levels of EPA and DHA and a high EPA + DHA:AA ratio predict favorable depression outcomes in patients receiving omega-3 supplements. Omega-3 supplementation may be an effective treatment for depression, but the requisite dosage and duration of treatment may depend on the patient's baseline level of omega-3 fatty acids.

Abnormalities in this microbiota-gut-brain axis have emerged as a key component in the pathophysiology of depression, leading to more research attempting to understand the neuroactive potential of the products of gut microbial metabolism. This review explores the potential for the gut microbiota to contribute to depression and focuses on the role that microbially-derived molecules - neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids, indoles, bile acids, choline metabolites, lactate and vitamins - play in the context of emotional behavior. The future of gut-brain axis research lies is moving away from association, towards the mechanisms underlying the relationship between the gut bacteria and depressive behavior. We propose that direct and indirect mechanisms exist through which gut microbial metabolites affect depressive behavior: these include (i) direct stimulation of central receptors, (ii) peripheral stimulation of neural, endocrine, and immune mediators, and (iii) epigenetic regulation of histone acetylation and DNA methylation. Elucidating these mechanisms is essential to expand our understanding of the etiology of depression, and to develop new strategies to harness the beneficial psychotropic effects of these molecules. Overall, the review highlights the potential for dietary interventions to represent such novel therapeutic strategies for major depressive disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Caspani G ; Kennedy S ; Foster JA ; Swann J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.15698/mic2019.10.693 ","Keywords":"bile acids\r\nindole\r\nlactate\r\nmental health\r\nmicrobiome\r\ntryptophan\r\nvitamins","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Caspani G, Kennedy S, Foster JA, and Swann J (2019) Gut microbial metabolites in depression: understanding the biochemical mechanisms..

Epidemiologic studies have found that adults who were born with a normal, yet low birth weight have an increased susceptibility to diseases such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, and stroke in adulthood. Prenatal caloric malnutrition, low birth weight, and prematurity also increase the risk for neurodevelopmental disorders, schizophrenia, affective disorders, and schizoid and antisocial personality disorders. Placebo-controlled studies in medicated patients suggest that add-on treatment with omega-3 fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid, may ameliorate symptoms of major depressive disorder.

Despite the benefits of this diet, health care professionals still question its safety due to the elevated serum ketones it induces and the limited dietary fiber. To compound the controversy, patient compliance with the program is poor due to the restrictive nature of the diet and symptoms related to energy deficit and gastrointestinal adversity during the introductory and energy substrate transition phase of the diet. The studies presented here demonstrate safety and efficacy of the diet including the scientific support and rationale for the administration of exogenous ketone bodies and ketone sources as a complement to the restrictive dietary protocol or as an alternative to the diet.

This is a cross-sectional analysis with data from the second wave of the EpiFloripa Aging cohort study (2013/2014) including 1,130 individuals aged 60 years or older. The presence of depressive symptoms was measured by the 15-items Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), and the consumption of n-3-rich fish by a question of weekly frequency. The minimum set of variables for adjustment was defined using directed acyclic graph (DAG). Poisson regression with robust error variance was applied (adjusted by Model 1: demographic and socioeconomic variables, Model 2: added behavioral variables, Model 3: added health variables). We identified the prevalence of depressive symptoms in 19% of older adults and 51.8% reported eating n-3-rich fish once a week. Models 1 and 3 showed an inverse association between n-3-rich fish and depressive symptoms. However, the association was reduced when behavioral factors (leisure-time physical activity) were included in Model 2. These findings suggest that n-3-rich fish intake tends to be associated with depressive symptoms in older adults. However, other factors, such as physical exercise, are as pivotal as n-3 fatty acids in preventing the development of depressive symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ceolin G ; Rockenbach G ; Confortin SC ; d'Orsi E ; Moreira JD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1590/0102-311XEN011422 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nCohort Studies\r\n*Depression/epidemiology\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nBrazil/epidemiology\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3\r\nAging","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ceolin G, Rockenbach G, Confortin SC, d'Orsi E, and Moreira JD (2022) Association between the consumption of omega-3-rich fish and depressive symptoms in older adults living in a middle-income country: EpiFloripa Aging cohort study..

Quetiapine and olanzapine/fluoxetine are currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of bipolar depression, and a number of additional agents (including other atypical antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and novel compounds) have been studied with varying degrees of efficacy. The medication with the most evidence for efficacy in bipolar depression is quetiapine, with five studies showing positive efficacy compared to placebo. In contrast, five studies of lamotrigine were negative, although meta-analyses of the pooled have found some treatment effects. Two studies of olanzapine and olanzapine/fluoxetine and three small studies of divalproex showed significant efficacy in treating bipolar depression. Two studies of aripiprazole found no differences compared to placebo. Early research on lithium in bipolar depression had significant methodological flaws, and only one study of lithium met our primary search criteria. To better understand the role of antidepressants, we also examined studies of antidepressants as adjunctive treatment of bipolar depression in participants taking mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics. These studies reported mixed results for a variety of antidepressants, but the majority found no differences compared to placebo. Other studies of adjunctive treatment were also discussed. There has been one positive adjunctive study each of lamotrigine, omega-3 fatty acids, modafinil, and armodafinil, while there was one negative trial each of omega-3 fatty acids, ziprasidone, and levetiracetam.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cerullo MA ; Strakowski SM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S1092852913000102 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*complications\r\nDepression/complications/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/complications/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cerullo MA, and Strakowski SM (2013) A systematic review of the evidence for the treatment of acute depression in bipolar I disorder..

Based on epidemiological data, clinical trials, and meta-analytic reviews, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) seem to be a biological link between depression and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).

We hypothesize that n-3 PUFAs link depression and CVDs via \"PUFA-prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) cascade.\" Testing. To further support our hypothesis, case-control studies are needed to test the role of COX2 and PLA2 functions in depression and in CVDs. In addition, the effects of n-3 PUFAs on cardiovascular markers in depression and on depressive symptoms in CVDs should be investigated in clinical trials. Finally, the effects of manipulating COX2 and PLA2 functions on depression-like behaviors and cardiovascular functions could be explored in animal studies. Implications. n-3 PUFAs might be a promising treatment for both cardiovascular diseases and depression via its anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chang JP ; Chen YT ; Su KP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1155/2009/725310 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chang JP, Chen YT, and Su KP (2009) Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (n-3 PUFAs) in Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) and Depression: The Missing Link?.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are natural anti-inflammatory agents and may reduce inflammation-induced behavioral changes. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of PUFAs on the development of somatic symptoms and depression in patients of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) receiving interferon-alpha therapy (IFN-α) in a prospective manner. METHODS: In this 24-week, prospective cohort study, 43 patients with chronic HCV ongoing IFN-α therapy were assessed with the mini-international neuropsychiatric interview for major depressive episodes and neurotoxicity rating scale (NRS) for somatic symptoms. RESULTS: One-third later developed IFN-α-induced depression (depression (DEP) group). As compared to subjects without depression, DEP group had higher NRS scores (P < 0.001), lower eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) levels (P = 0.038) at week 2. Somatic symptoms, regardless of painful/non-painful characteristics, had positive association with arachidonic acid (P < 0.05), and negative association with EPA (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study implies that early intervention with omega-3 PUFAs might be a promising strategy to prevent depression and somatic symptoms in patients receiving cytokine therapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chang JP ; Lai HC ; Yang HT ; Su WP ; Peng CY ; Gałecki P ; Walczewska A ; Pariante CM ; Su KP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/1028415X.2015.1123378 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCohort Studies\r\nDepression/*chemically induced/epidemiology/prevention & control\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/*blood\r\nFemale\r\nHepatitis C, Chronic/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nInterferon-alpha/*adverse effects/blood/toxicity\r\nMale\r\n*Medically Unexplained Symptoms\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nProspective Studies\r\nDepression\r\nOmega-3\r\nPUFAs\r\nPainful symptoms\r\nn-3","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chang JP, Lai HC, Yang HT, Su WP, Peng CY, Gałecki P, Walczewska A, Pariante CM, and Su KP (2017) Polyunsaturated fatty acids levels and initial presentation of somatic symptoms induced by interferon-alpha therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C viral infection..

Ketamine is a rapid antidepressant. In order to obtain better antidepressant effects, it is necessary to explore the efficacy of combination therapy with ketamine and other antidepressants. DHA is an unsaturated fatty acid with excellent application prospects due to its safety and antidepressant effects. This study was designed to investigate the effect of ketamine combined with DHA on lipopolysaccharide-induced depression-like behavior. In behavioral experiments, lipopolysaccharide prolongs the immobility time of the forced swimming and tail suspension tests in rats and reduces the sucrose preference. The combination of ketamine and DHA can reverse these changes and work better than the single application. Nissl staining showed that ketamine combined with DHA can reverse the nerve damage caused by lipopolysaccharide. Cell morphology observation the combination of ketamine and DHA group was more complete than that of LPS group. The combination of ketamine and DHA significantly decreased the levels of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-ɑin hippocampus and PC12 cells and increased the content of BDNF. Immunofluorescence results showed that ketamine combined with DHA can effectively inhibit PP65 nuclear translocation. Western blot results showed that ketamine combined with DHA can effectively inhibit the expression of NF-KB in hippocampus and PC12 cells, and increase the expression of P-CREB and BDNF. In summary, the combination of ketamine with DHA may be a more effective treatment for depression caused by inflammation and is mediated by inhibition of the inflammatory pathway.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chang D ; Zhao J ; Zhang X ; Lian H ; Du X ; Yuan R ; Wen Y ; Gao L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.intimp.2019.105788 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nCyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism\r\nCytokines/metabolism\r\nDepression/chemically induced/*drug therapy\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nKetamine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nLipopolysaccharides\r\nMale\r\nNF-kappa B/metabolism\r\nPC12 Cells\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nDHA\r\nDepression\r\nInflammation\r\nKetamine\r\nLipopolysaccharide\r\nNF-KB","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chang D, Zhao J, Zhang X, Lian H, Du X, Yuan R, Wen Y, and Gao L (2019) Effect of ketamine combined with DHA on lipopolysaccharide-induced depression-like behavior in rats..

Patients with CVDs comorbid depression had lower levels of total omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and a higher omega-6 to omega-3 ratio. However, there have been limited studies on the effects n-3 PUFAs on MDD in patients with CVDs. METHOD: We have enrolled a total of 59 patients (64% males, mean age of 61.5 ± 9.0 years and mean education of 10.2 ± 4.2 years) with CVDs comorbid MDD. They were randomized into either receiving n-3 PUFAs (2 g per day of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 1 g of DHA) or placebo for 12 weeks. We assessed depression symptom severity with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), as well as blood fatty acid levels, electrocardiogram and blood biochemistry, at the baseline and at the endpoint. RESULTS: There were no differences between the n-3 PUFAs and placebo group in the changes of HAMD and BDI total scores, while PUFAs group had a greater reduction in HAMD Cognition subscale scores than the placebo group at week 8 (p < 0.05). Moreover, subgroup analyses found that the n-3 group had a greater reduction of HAMD Core subscale scores than the placebo group at the end of week 12 (p < 0.05) for the very severe DEP group (HAMD ≥ 23). CONCLUSION: Overall, n-3 PUFAs did not show a beneficial effect on depressive symptoms when compared with placebo. However, when stratified with depression severity, n-3 PUFAs supplementation improved core depression symptoms in the very severe MDD group. N-3 PUFAs supplementation may provide a treatment option for a subpopulation of patients with CVDs comorbid MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chang JP ; Chang SS ; Yang HT ; Chen HT ; Chien YC ; Yang B ; Su H ; Su KP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbi.2019.03.012 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\n*Cardiovascular Diseases\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/complications/drug therapy\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/therapeutic use\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/therapeutic use\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nCardiovascular diseases\r\nDHA\r\nEPA\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nOmega-3 fatty acid\r\nPUFAs","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chang JP, Chang SS, Yang HT, Chen HT, Chien YC, Yang B, Su H, and Su KP (2020) Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in cardiovascular diseases comorbid major depressive disorder - Results from a randomized controlled trial..

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to a 300 mg/l lead acetate solution for 24 weeks, with or without probiotic (freeze-dried powder containing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium: 6 billion live bacteria/2 g) intervention in weeks 17-24. The sucrose preference test (SPT), the forced swim test (FST), and the tail suspension test (TST) were preformed to study the depression- like behaviors of these rats. The alteration of rat gut microbiota induced by lead exposure was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing, and the levels of fecal SCFAs were detected using gas chromatography. RESULTS: Neurobehavioral tests showed that lead exposure induced depression-like behavior in rats, including reduced sucrose preference in the SPT, and increased immobility times in the FST and the TST. Sequencing and gas chromatography showed that lead exposure changed the structure and the phylogenetic diversity of the gut microbiota, as well as significantly altered the levels of SCFAs. Moreover, the depression-like behaviors, and the changes in both gut microbiota and SCFAs, could be mitigated by probiotic intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Lead exposure not only changes the structure and diversity of the gut microbiome but also affects metabolic function. Probiotic intervention may be a novel initiative for the prevention and treatment of neurological damage following lead exposure.

Aromatherapy may improve mood and alleviate sleep challenges. However, few randomized controlled clinical trials have focused on the effect of aromatherapy in postpartum women. PURPOSE: This study was designed to explore the effect of a bergamot essential oil aromatherapy intervention on depressive mood and sleep quality in postpartum women. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial used consecutive sampling. The participants were all women in a postpartum care center in eastern Taiwan and were randomly assigned to either the experimental (n = 29) or control (n = 31) group. Bergamot essential oil aroma was used in the experimental group, and pure water aroma was used in the control group. The experimental and control interventions were both performed while the participants were residents at the postpartum care center in the afternoon for 15 minutes each day. Before the aroma intervention, pretests were conducted using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Postpartum Sleep Quality Scale. The first and second posttests were conducted using the same two scales at 2 and 4 weeks after the intervention, respectively. RESULTS: At both the first and second posttests, depressive mood was significantly lower (p < .001) in the experimental group than in the control group, supporting the positive effect of the bergamot essential oil aroma intervention on depressive mood in postpartum women. No significant intergroup difference in sleep quality (p > .05) was observed at either the first or second posttest, indicating an uncertain effect of the bergamot essential oil aroma intervention on sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The results of this study support the effectiveness of bergamot essential oil aromatherapy in alleviating depressive mood in postpartum women. In addition, the results provide a practical reference for clinical postpartum nursing care.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chen ML ; Chen YE ; Lee HF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/jnr.0000000000000459 ","Keywords":"*Aromatherapy\r\nDepression/therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\n*Oils, Volatile/therapeutic use\r\nPostpartum Period\r\nSleep\r\nSleep Quality","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chen ML, Chen YE, and Lee HF (2022) The Effect of Bergamot Essential Oil Aromatherapy on Improving Depressive Mood and Sleep Quality in Postpartum Women: A Randomized Controlled Trial..

The unique aroma of saffron, primarily derived from its volatile oil, has been widely used by folk to mitigate anxiety and depression via sniffing because the aroma of saffron has a pleasant and invigorating effect. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the antidepressant effect and the underlying mechanism of saffron essential oil (SEO) in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, compounds of SEO were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, while network pharmacology was used to predict potential active compounds, antidepressant targets, and related signaling pathways of SEO. The CUMS depression model was further used to explore the therapeutic effect and possible mechanism of SEO. During the modeling period, mice were regularly administered fluoxetine (3.6 mg/kg, i.g.) or diluted SEO (2%, 4%, and 6% SEO, inhalation). The antidepressant and neuroprotective effects of SEO were evaluated by behavior tests (the open field test, the sucrose preference test, the tail suspension test, and the forced swimming test), hematoxylin-eosin staining, and Nissl staining. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were used to measure dopamine (DA), 5-serotonin (5-HT), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in serum. The relative abundance of Raf1, MEK1, P-ERK1/2/ERK1/2, P-CREB1/CREB1, BDNF, and P-Trk B/Trk B in the hippocampus was determined using western blot (WB). RESULTS: According to the network pharmacology analysis, seven active SEO compounds mediated 113 targets related to depression treatment, most of which were enriched in the 5-HT synapse, calcium signaling pathway, and cAMP signaling pathway. In vivo experiments indicated that fluoxetine and SEO improved depression-like behaviors in depressed mice. The levels of 5-HT, DA, BDNF, and GABA in serum increased significantly. Histopathological examinations revealed that fluoxetine and SEO ameliorated neuronal damage in the hippocampus. WB analysis showed that the relative expressions of Raf1, MEK1, P-ERK1/2/ERK1/2, P-CREB1/CREB1, BDNF, and P-Trk B/Trk B were significantly higher in the fluoxetine and SEO groups than in the CUMS group. CONCLUSION: Overall, these findings suggest that SEO significantly alleviates the depressive symptoms in CUMS exposed mice and partially restores hippocampal neuronal damage. Meanwhile, the best efficacy was observed in 4% SEO. Furthermore, the antidepressant mechanism of SEO is primarily dependent on the regulation of the MAPK-CREB1-BDNF signaling pathway.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chen Z ; Gu J ; Lin S ; Xu Z ; Xu H ; Zhao J ; Feng P ; Tao Y ; Chen S ; Wang P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jep.2022.115719 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\n*Crocus/metabolism\r\nDepression/drug therapy/etiology/metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDopamine/metabolism\r\nEosine Yellowish-(YS)/metabolism/pharmacology\r\nFluoxetine/pharmacology\r\nHematoxylin/metabolism/pharmacology\r\nHippocampus\r\nMAP Kinase Signaling System\r\nMice\r\n*Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology\r\n*Oils, Volatile/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nSignal Transduction\r\nStress, Physiological\r\nStress, Psychological/drug therapy\r\nSucrose/metabolism/pharmacology\r\ngamma-Aminobutyric Acid/metabolism\r\nAntidepressant\r\nBDNF\r\nCREB1\r\nMAPK cascade\r\nNetwork pharmacology\r\nSaffron essential oil","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chen Z, Gu J, Lin S, Xu Z, Xu H, Zhao J, Feng P, Tao Y, Chen S, and Wang P (2023) Saffron essential oil ameliorates CUMS-induced depression-like behavior in mice via the MAPK-CREB1-BDNF signaling pathway..

As omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are low in MDD and affect myelination, we hypothesized that PUFA supplementation may alleviate depression through improving white matter integrity. Acutely depressed MDD patients (n = 16) and healthy volunteers (HV, n = 12) had 25-direction diffusion tensor imaging before and after 6 weeks of fish oil supplementation. Plasma phospholipid omega-3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and omega-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) levels were determined before and after supplementation using high-throughput extraction and gas chromatography and expressed as a percentage of total phospholipids (PUFA%). Fractional anisotropy (FA) was computed using a least-squares-fit diffusion tensor with non-linear optimization. Regression analyses were performed with changes in PUFA levels or Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores as predictors, voxel-wise difference maps of FA as outcome, covariates age and sex, with family-wise correction for multiple comparisons. Increases in plasma phospholipid DHA% (but not EPA% or AA%) after fish oil predicted increases in FA in MDD but not HV, in a cluster including genu and body of the corpus callosum, and anterior corona radiata and cingulum (cluster-level p < 0.001, peak t-score = 8.10, p = 0.002). There was a trend for greater change in FA in MDD responders over nonresponders (t = -1.874, df = 13.56, p = 0.08). Decreased depression severity predicted increased FA in left corticospinal tract and superior longitudinal fasciculus (cluster-level p < 0.001, peak t-score = 5.04, p = 0.0001). Increased FA correlated with increased DHA% and decreased depression severity after fish oil supplementation suggests therapeutic effects of omega-3 PUFAs may be related to improvements in white matter integrity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chhetry BT ; Hezghia A ; Miller JM ; Lee S ; Rubin-Falcone H ; Cooper TB ; Oquendo MA ; Mann JJ ; Sublette ME ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2015.12.007 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnisotropy\r\nBrain Mapping\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*diagnostic imaging/*diet therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDiffusion Tensor Imaging\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nImaging, Three-Dimensional\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPositron-Emission Tomography\r\nStatistics, Nonparametric\r\nWhite Matter/*diagnostic imaging\r\nYoung Adult\r\nDTI\r\nDocosahexaenoic acid\r\nFractional anisotropy\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nOmega-3\r\nPUFA","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chhetry BT, Hezghia A, Miller JM, Lee S, Rubin-Falcone H, Cooper TB, Oquendo MA, Mann JJ, and Sublette ME (2016) Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation and white matter changes in major depression..

Previously mostly pro-inflammatory cytokines of immune system (IL-6, TNF, etc.) were taken into account. However, recent understanding of resolution of inflammation as an active process drew attention to mediators of resolution, which include both proteins and ω-3 and ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids derivatives (resolvins, cyclopentenone prostaglandins, etc.). This review takes into account new data on resolution of inflammation and action of mediators of resolution in models of depression. New facts and ideas about mechanisms of chronic inflammation onset are considered in relation to mood disorders. Basic control mechanisms of inflammation at the cellular level and the role of resolution substances in regulation of depression and other mood disorders are discussed. Signaling systems of innate immunity located in non-immune cells and their ability to generate substances that affect an onset of depression are reviewed. A novel hypothesis of depression as a type of abnormal resolution is proposed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chistyakov DV ; Astakhova AA ; Sergeeva MG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.yexmp.2018.08.002 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nCytokines\r\nDepression/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nHumans\r\nImmunity, Innate/physiology\r\nInflammation/*metabolism/pathology\r\nInflammation Mediators/metabolism\r\nMental Disorders/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nMood Disorders/*immunology/*metabolism\r\nSignal Transduction\r\nBipolar disorders\r\nCytokines\r\nDepression\r\nInflammation\r\nInnate immunity\r\nMood disorders\r\nResolution\r\nResolvins\r\nSignaling pathways\r\nToll-like receptors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chistyakov DV, Astakhova AA, and Sergeeva MG (2018) Resolution of inflammation and mood disorders..

We hypothesized that n-3 PUFA combined with live and dead probiotics synergistically improves depression by modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and serotonergic pathways through the brain-gut axis. Rats were randomly divided into seven groups (n = 8/group): nonchronic mild stress (CMS) with n-6 PUFA, CMS with n-3 PUFA, n-6 PUFA, live probiotics, dead probiotics, n-3 PUFA, and live probiotics, and n-3 PUFA and dead probiotics. Diets of n-6 and n-3 PUFA and oral supplementation of live and dead probiotics were provided for 12 weeks, and CMS was performed for the last 5 weeks. N-3 PUFA and probiotics improved depressive behaviors and modulated the brain and gut HPA axis by synergistically increasing glucocorticoid receptor expression and decreasing corticotropin-releasing factor expression and blood levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone. N-3 PUFA and probiotics upregulated the brain serotonergic pathway through serotonin levels and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, phosphorylated cAMP response binding protein, and 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A receptor while downregulating the gut serotonergic pathway. Furthermore, n-3 PUFA and probiotics increased the abundance of Ruminococcaceae, brain and gut short chain fatty acid levels, and occludin expression while decreasing the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and prostaglandin E(2) and blood lipopolysaccharides levels. There was no significant difference between the live and dead probiotics. In conclusion, n-3 PUFA and probiotics had synergistic antidepressant-like effects on the HPA axis and serotonergic pathways of the brain and gut through the brain-gut axis.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cho H ; Jo M ; Oh H ; Lee Y ; Park Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jnutbio.2023.109326 ","Keywords":"Rats\r\nAnimals\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3/pharmacology/metabolism\r\nDepression/therapy/metabolism\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/metabolism\r\nBrain-Gut Axis\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System/physiology\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\n*Probiotics\r\nBrain-gut axis\r\nDepression\r\nHPA axis\r\nN-3 PUFA\r\nProbiotics\r\nSerotonergic pathway","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cho H, Jo M, Oh H, Lee Y, and Park Y (2023) Synergistic antidepressant-like effect of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and probiotics through the brain-gut axis in rats exposed to chronic mild stress..

Rats were fed a modified American Institute of Nutrition-93G diet with 0% n-3 PUFAs and 1% ALA, EPA and DHA relative to total energy intake for 12 weeks and were injected with corn oil or E every 4 days during the last 3 weeks. Supplementation of EPA, DHA and E increased serum concentrations of serotonin and climbing behavior, and decreased immobility during a forced swimming test. Supplementation with EPA, DHA and E also decreased hippocampal expressions of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and increased cAMP response element binding protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and estrogen receptor-α. Immunofluorescence staining consistently showed elevated expressions of BDNF. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that E increased glucose and decreased glutamate, glutamine and myo-inositol concentrations regardless of n-3 PUFA supplementation. In addition, supplementation with EPA, DHA and E decreased levels of nitrite and nitrate. However, ALA had no antidepressant effect. The present study suggested that the antidepressant-like effects of EPA and DHA supplementation and E injection could be due to the regulation of serotonergic neurotransmission and inflammatory cytokines rather than due to the antioxidative system. Supplementation with n-3 PUFA and E had the additional function of modulating neurometabolites in the hippocampus.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Choi JE ; Park Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jnutbio.2017.07.012 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBrain Chemistry/drug effects\r\nDepression/immunology/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\n*Disease Models, Animal\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/*therapeutic use\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/*therapeutic use\r\nEstradiol/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology\r\nHormone Replacement Therapy\r\nInjections, Subcutaneous\r\nNerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism\r\nOvariectomy/adverse effects\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSerotonergic Neurons/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology\r\nSerotonin/blood\r\nalpha-Linolenic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nAntioxidant\r\nBDNF\r\nDepression\r\nEstrogen\r\nN-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nNeurometabolites\r\nRats","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Choi JE, and Park Y (2017) EPA and DHA, but not ALA, have antidepressant effects with 17β-estradiol injection via regulation of a neurobiological system in ovariectomized rats..

Although many factors determine the mental health of an individual, diet has been gaining popularity as a key modifiable factor in the prevention and management of depression. Nutritional Psychiatry is an emerging field where researchers suggest that the food we consume influences our mental well-being. AIM: This review aims to explore the significance of diet, nutrient deficiencies, imbalances, and unhealthy dietary patterns in the prevention and management of unipolar depression or major depressive disorder among adolescents. METHODS: Electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and MEDLINE were searched using keywords such as \"mental health,\" \"depression,\" \"adolescents,\" \"diet,\" \"dietary pattern,\" and pertinent articles (N = 68) were retrieved and reviewed. RESULTS: The Mediterranean and traditional diets rich in complex carbohydrates, omega-3 fatty acids, B-group vitamins and several amino acids have shown negative correlation with the incidence of depression. On the other hand, Western dietary patterns (sweetened beverages, processed/ junk food, and foods rich in saturated fatty acids), along with low consumption of fruits and vegetables have been linked to an increased risk of depression among adolescents. CONCLUSION: Dietary modification can prove to be a cost-effective strategy for the prevention and treatment of depression among adolescents.

Omega 3 fatty acid intakes (both in terms of absolute amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and the ratio of these 2 fatty acids) varied widely in these studies, however, and no clear consensus exists regarding the effects of omega 3 fatty acids on any of these outcomes. Because of the potential importance of these fatty acids for pregnant or lactating women, fetus, and newborn infants and the limited data from clinical trials assessing the effect of these fatty acids on pregnancy and infant outcomes, additional research is required to better define optimal intakes of specific omega 3 fatty acids during these critical periods.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chowdhury MH ; Ghosh S ; Kabir MR ; Mamun MAA ; Islam MS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/14767058.2020.1786522 ","Keywords":"Dietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid\r\nFatty Acids\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLactation\r\nPregnancy\r\n*Pregnant Women\r\nPregnancy\r\nclinical trials\r\nlong-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nomega 3 fatty acids\r\nsupplement","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chowdhury MH, Ghosh S, Kabir MR, Mamun MAA, and Islam MS (2022) Effect of supplementary omega-3 fatty acids on pregnant women with complications and pregnancy outcomes: review from literature..

However, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) differ in terms of biochemistry, metabolism and therapeutic effects. Therefore, a clear picture of their specific and different role on affective disorders has not yet emerged. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of n-3PUFAs on affective disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder and perinatal depression. METHODS: a comprehensive search on PUBMED, Medline and PsychINFO of all RCTs using n-3PUFAs patients with depressive symptoms published up to April 2016 was performed. We included trials that examined unipolar or bipolar disorder and trials that investigated depressive symptoms in relation to pregnancy. Trials were excluded if the depressive symptomatology was related to other primary organic diseases. RESULTS: 264 RCT studies were identified but only 36 met the inclusion criteria. First, it has been reported that n-3PUFAs supplementation might have clinical benefits on depressive symptoms. Second, EPA supplement, rather than DHA, seems to be more effective in treating major depression. Third, n-3PUFAs can have beneficial effects in bipolar depression but not in perinatal depression. CONCLUSIONS: there are only some evidence on the efficacy of n-3PUFAs in affective disorders especially to unipolar and bipolar depression not powered enough to confirm a therapeutic effect for affective disorder. Therefore, further studies with larger and more homogeneous samples, are required to confirm these effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ciappolino V ; Delvecchio G ; Agostoni C ; Mazzocchi A ; Altamura AC ; Brambilla P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2016.12.034 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/therapeutic use\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMood Disorders/*drug therapy/prevention & control\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nDHA\r\nDepression\r\nEPA\r\nMood disorders\r\nOmega3\r\nPost-partum\r\nPregnancy\r\nPuerperium\r\nn-3PUFAs","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ciappolino V, Delvecchio G, Agostoni C, Mazzocchi A, Altamura AC, and Brambilla P (2017) The role of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFAs) in affective disorders..

As fish oil (FO) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) are known Nrf2 inducers, their protective ability is comparatively evaluated in a murine model of depression (MRL/MpJ-Fas(lpr) ). Oxidative stress, fatty acids content, and critical factors reflecting brain functioning-namely brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synaptic markers, and cholinergic signaling-are preliminarily evaluated in the frontal cortex of 8-week (Young) and in 22-week old animals (Old), which are used as model of depression. These markers are measured in Old mice at the end of a 5-week pretreatment with FO or CLA (728 or 650 mg kg(-1) , respectively). Old mice exhibit disrupted Redox homeostasis, compensatory Nrf2 hyperactivation, lower docosaheaxaenoic acid (DHA), and lower BDNF and synaptic function proteins compared to Young mice. FO and CLA treatment relieves almost all the pathophysiological hallmarks at a level comparable to Young mice. Presented data provide the first evidence for the comparable efficacy of FO or CLA supplementation in preventing depression signs in Old MRL/lpr mice, likely through their ability of improving Nrf2-mediated antioxidant defenses.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cigliano L ; Spagnuolo MS ; Boscaino F ; Ferrandino I ; Monaco A ; Capriello T ; Cocca E ; Iannotta L ; Treppiccione L ; Luongo D ; Maurano F ; Rossi M ; Bergamo P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/mnfr.201900243 ","Keywords":"Aging\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology\r\nAutoimmunity/drug effects\r\nBiomarkers/metabolism\r\nBrain/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nDepression/*diet therapy/metabolism/pathology\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/metabolism\r\nFatty Acid Elongases/genetics\r\nFatty Acids/metabolism\r\nFish Oils/*pharmacology\r\nInflammation/diet therapy\r\nLinoleic Acids, Conjugated/*pharmacology\r\nLiver/drug effects/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMice, Inbred MRL lpr\r\nNF-E2-Related Factor 2/*metabolism\r\nOxidative Stress/drug effects\r\nStearoyl-CoA Desaturase/genetics\r\nTumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism\r\nbrain derived neurotrophic factor\r\nbrain fatty acid profile\r\nconjugated linoleic acid\r\ndepression\r\nfish oil\r\nnuclear erythroid related factor-2","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cigliano L, Spagnuolo MS, Boscaino F, Ferrandino I, Monaco A, Capriello T, Cocca E, Iannotta L, Treppiccione L, Luongo D, Maurano F, Rossi M, and Bergamo P (2019) Dietary Supplementation with Fish Oil or Conjugated Linoleic Acid Relieves Depression Markers in Mice by Modulation of the Nrf2 Pathway..

Adult male Wistar rats were divided into four dietary groups: Control group (C) - chow ad libitum; CR group - 30 % CR, considering C group food intake; FO group - FO-enriched chow ad libitum; and CR + FO group - FO-enriched 30 % CR chow. After 12 weeks of dietary treatment, behavioural analysis set was conducted, and hippocampal BDNF concentrations were measured. FO group presented anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like behaviors as well as improved memory in the Morris' water maze. These effects were attenuated by the combined CR + FO treatment. FO group also presented higher BDNF concentrations. There was a positive association between the number of entries in the platform quadrant in the MWM and hippocampal BDNF concentrations (β = 0.39; R² = 0.15; p = 0.042) and an inverse association between forced swim immobility time and BDNF concentrations (β = -0.39; R² = 0.15; p = 0.041). Taken together, our data showed that the 12-week FO dietary treatment promoted anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like behaviors as well as memory improvement, and these effects were associated with BDNF concentrations.

We searched the Pubmed and ScienceDirect databases for articles published from 2000 to 2020 on inadequate intake of vitamins (B12, folate, vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin K), micronutrients (cooper, iron, creatine, choline, zinc, iodine), macronutrients (fatty acids, proteins), high fat diets, ketogenic diets, hypercaloric diets, and maternal undernutrition. Some older relevant articles were included. The search produced a total of 3590 articles, and 84 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. Data were extracted and analyzed using charts and the frequency of terms used. We concluded that inadequate nutrient intake during pregnancy was associated with brain defects (diminished cerebral volume, spina bifida, alteration of hypothalamic and hippocampal pathways), an increased risk of abnormal behavior, neuropsychiatric disorders (ASD, ADHD, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression), altered cognition, visual impairment, and motor deficits. Future studies should establish and quantify the benefits of maternal nutrition during pregnancy on neurodevelopment and recommend adequate supplementation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cortés-Albornoz MC ; García-Guáqueta DP ; Velez-van-Meerbeke A ; Talero-Gutiérrez C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu13103530 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDiet/adverse effects\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfant\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nMale\r\nMalnutrition/*physiopathology\r\nMaternal Exposure/*adverse effects\r\nMaternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nMicronutrients/analysis\r\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders/*etiology\r\nNutrients/analysis\r\nNutritional Status\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/*physiopathology\r\nPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*etiology\r\nVitamins/analysis\r\ncognitive abilities\r\nmaternal nutrition\r\nneurodevelopment\r\nneuropsychiatric disorders\r\nnutrients","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cortés-Albornoz MC, García-Guáqueta DP, Velez-van-Meerbeke A, and Talero-Gutiérrez C (2021) Maternal Nutrition and Neurodevelopment: A Scoping Review..

Citrus aurantium was chosen based on ethnopharmacological data because traditional medicine refers to the Citrus genus as useful in diminishing the symptoms of anxiety or insomnia, and C. aurantium has more recently been proposed as an adjuvant for antidepressants. In the present work, we investigated the biological activity underlying the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of C. aurantium essential oil (EO), the putative mechanism of the anxiolytic-like effect, and the neurochemical changes in specific brain structures of mice after acute treatment. We also monitored the mice for possible signs of toxicity after a 14-day treatment. METHODS: The anxiolytic-like activity of the EO was investigated in a light/dark box, and the antidepressant activity was investigated in a forced swim test. Flumazenil, a competitive antagonist of benzodiazepine binding, and the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY100635 were used in the experimental procedures to determine the mechanism of action of the EO. To exclude false positive results due to motor impairment, the mice were submitted to the rotarod test. RESULTS: The data suggest that the anxiolytic-like activity observed in the light/dark box procedure after acute (5 mg/kg) or 14-day repeated (1 mg/kg/day) dosing was mediated by the serotonergic system (5-HT(1A) receptors). Acute treatment with the EO showed no activity in the forced swim test, which is sensitive to antidepressants. A neurochemical evaluation showed no alterations in neurotransmitter levels in the cortex, the striatum, the pons, and the hypothalamus. Furthermore, no locomotor impairment or signs of toxicity or biochemical changes, except a reduction in cholesterol levels, were observed after treatment with the EO. CONCLUSION: This work contributes to a better understanding of the biological activity of C. aurantium EO by characterizing the mechanism of action underlying its anxiolytic-like activity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Costa CA ; Cury TC ; Cassettari BO ; Takahira RK ; Flório JC ; Costa M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1472-6882-13-42 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnti-Anxiety Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAnticholesteremic Agents/pharmacology\r\nAnxiety/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBrain/drug effects/metabolism\r\nCholesterol/*blood\r\nCitrus/*chemistry\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nFlumazenil/pharmacology\r\nGABA Modulators/pharmacology\r\nLight\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred Strains\r\nNeurotransmitter Agents/metabolism\r\nOils, Volatile/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\n*Phytotherapy\r\nPlant Extracts/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nReceptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A/*metabolism\r\nRotarod Performance Test\r\nSerotonin Receptor Agonists/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nSwimming","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Costa CA, Cury TC, Cassettari BO, Takahira RK, Flório JC, and Costa M (2013) Citrus aurantium L. essential oil exhibits anxiolytic-like activity mediated by 5-HT(1A)-receptors and reduces cholesterol after repeated oral treatment..

The Panelists also felt that there was sufficient evidence to support increasing omega-3 intake to receive cardiovascular, immunological, and surgical benefits. In addition, research indicates that preloading with omega-3 FAs before combat exposure may be beneficial. Evidence for reduction of depressive symptoms and suicide prevention was felt to be strong. Insufficient data were available to evaluate post-traumatic stress disorder and impulsive aggression. Benefits for traumatic brain injury were promising. Adverse side effects were deemed negligible.

Although many risk factors have been considered in its pathogenesis, nutrition seems to play a determinant role in its prevention. With regard to individual macronutrients, dietary fats and especially n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) are the most studied. However, previous data about other dietary fatty acids, such as n-6 PUFA, are conflicting, and little is known about saturated fatty acids (SFA), especially when considering carbon chain length. Thus, we investigated whether single types and subtypes of dietary fats are related to depressive symptoms in Italian individuals living in the Mediterranean area. METHODS: Dietary and socio-demographic data of 1572 individuals were analyzed. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) were used to determine the consumption of total dietary fat and each specific class of dietary fat, such as SFA, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), and PUFA. The intake of fatty acids was also assessed according to the carbon-chain length of each single class. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used as a screening tool for depressive symptoms. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounding factors, a significant inverse association between low/moderate levels of PUFA intake and depressive symptoms (Q2 vs. Q1, odds ratio (OR) = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.84) was found. On the other hand, moderate saturated fat consumption was associated with depressive symptoms (Q3 vs. Q1, OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.04). However, when considering carbon chain length, individuals with a lower to moderate intake of short-chain saturated fatty acids (SCSFA) and medium-chain saturated fatty acids (MCSFA) were less likely to have depressive symptoms (Q3 vs. Q1, OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.31, 0.75), while moderate intake of arachidic acid (C20:0) was directly associated with depressive symptoms (Q3 vs. Q1, OR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.26, 2.77). Among single MUFAs, higher myristoleic acid (C14:1) intake was directly associated with depressive symptoms (Q4 vs. Q1, OR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.12, 2.61), while moderate intake of erucic acid (C22:1) was associated with lower odds of having depressive symptoms (Q3 vs. Q1, OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.86). When considering individual PUFAs, individuals with moderate and higher intakes of arachidonic acid (C20:4) were less likely to have depressive symptoms (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.91; OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.91, respectively). Similarly, higher eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5) intake was inversely associated with depressive symptoms (Q4 vs. Q1, OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.98), while a significant association for docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6) was retrieved only for low intakes (Q2 vs. Q1, OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Dietary fat intake may be associated with depressive symptoms, underlying the importance of distinguishing between different fat types. This study confirms the pivotal role of PUFAs and reopens the debate on the role of saturated fatty acids, suggesting plausible effects of moderate intakes of short-chain fatty acids.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Currenti W ; Godos J ; Alanazi AM ; Lanza G ; Ferri R ; Caraci F ; Galvano F ; Castellano S ; Grosso G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu15030675 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nHumans\r\n*Dietary Fats/adverse effects\r\n*Depression/epidemiology/etiology\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated\r\nFatty Acids/adverse effects\r\nDiet/adverse effects\r\nFatty Acids, Volatile\r\narachidonic acid\r\ndepression\r\ndietary fats\r\nfat\r\nmonounsaturated fats\r\nmood\r\npolyunsaturated fats\r\nsaturated fats\r\nshort-chain fatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Currenti W, Godos J, Alanazi AM, Lanza G, Ferri R, Caraci F, Galvano F, Castellano S, and Grosso G (2023) Dietary Fats and Depressive Symptoms in Italian Adults..

The inception of n-3 PUFA as a putative depression therapeutic may have stemmed from reports suggesting that dietary n-3 PUFA deficiency is linked to both altered membrane PUFA content as well as clinical depression. Several studies have examined n-3 PUFA treatment in depression, either singly or in combination with conventional antidepressant drugs. While results have been encouraging, fish oil treatment remains controversial. At least some of the reason for this is the lack of a defined site of action for n-3 PUFA that would be consistent with an antidepressant effect. This review will address this issue. While it is possible, even likely, that n-3 PUFA have multiple sites of action, this chapter will focus on sites at which n-3 PUFA modify G protein signaling and how those sites relate to both depression and antidepressant action. Much of the focus herein will be on specialized membrane domains (lipid rafts) and the effects that agents modifying those rafts have on elements of G protein signaling cascades. The relevance of specific alterations of G protein signaling for both depression and antidepressant action will be discussed, as will the ability for n-3 PUFA to act either as an antidepressant or in concert with conventional antidepressants.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Czysz AH ; Rasenick MM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1871527311312040005 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nCaveolae/drug effects\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*pharmacology\r\nGTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nMembrane Microdomains/*drug effects\r\nSignal Transduction/*drug effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Czysz AH, and Rasenick MM (2013) G-protein signaling, lipid rafts and the possible sites of action for the antidepressant effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids..

The objective was to investigate the effect of unbalanced dietary intake of omega-6/omega-3 ratio >9:1 in the prevalence for PPD. The study comprises a prospective cohort with four waves of follow-up during pregnancy and one following delivery. PPD was evaluated according to the Edinburgh Post-partum Depression Scale (PPD ≥ 11) in 106 puerperae between 2005 and 2007, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Independent variables included socio-demographic, obstetric, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and dietary intake data, which were obtained by means of a food frequency questionnaire in the first trimester of pregnancy. Statistical analysis involved calculation of PPD prevalence and multivariate Poisson regression with robust variance. PPD prevalence amounted to 26.4% [n = 28; confidence interval (CI) 95%: 18.0-34.8], and higher prevalences of PPD were observed in women who consumed an omega-6/omega-3 ratio >9:1 (60.0%) and in those with pre-pregnancy BMI <18.5 kg/m(2) (66.7%). These variables held as factors associated to PPD in the multivariate model, elevating the chances of occurrence of the outcome in 2.50 (CI 95%: 1.21-5.14) and 4.01 times (CI 95%: 1.96-8.20), respectively. Analyses were adjusted for age, schooling, pre-pregnancy BMI, lipids consumption and time elapsed since delivery. It verified an association between omega-6/omega-3 ratio above 9:1, the levels recommended by the Institute of Medicine, and the prevalence of PPD. These results add to the evidence regarding the importance of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids in the regulation of mental health mechanisms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"da Rocha CM ; Kac G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1740-8709.2010.00256.x ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nBody Mass Index\r\nCohort Studies\r\nDepression, Postpartum/*epidemiology\r\nDietary Fats, Unsaturated/*administration & dosage\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-6/*administration & dosage\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\n*Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nNutritional Requirements\r\nPregnancy\r\nPrevalence\r\nProspective Studies\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"da Rocha CM, and Kac G (2012) High dietary ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 polyunsaturated acids during pregnancy and prevalence of post-partum depression..

METHOD: Double-blind, placebo-controlled study analyzed depression in 31 patients with Parkinson's Disease and Major Depression (DSM-IV). The patients were double-blind separated in 2 groups that received fish oil (containing omega-3 fatty acids) or mineral oil capsules for 3 months; each group was separated in 2 new groups: one taking antidepressant medication and another one not taking it. RESULTS: 29 patients completed the 12-week trial, 58% were female and the mean age was 64.4 years old. Patients supplemented with fish oil showed a significant decrease in MADRS and CGI-Depression scores, and there was no difference among groups in BDI. 14 patients (42%) met criteria for > or = 50% reduction in MADRS score, 7 patients (22%) met criteria for remission (final MADRS total score < or = 12), and 2 patients (6%) discontinued supplementation of fish oil. HPLC analysis of fatty-acid profile showed increase of omega-3 fatty acid in the erythrocyte membrane of patients taking fish oil. CONCLUSION: These results reveal that PD patients taking fish oil, with or without antidepressants, presented improvement in depressive symptoms and indicate that the intake of omega-3 can be used with an antidepressant effect or as adjuvant therapy with some other medication. This is a first pilot study with parkinsonian patients and omega-3 supplementation and requires replication in a larger sample.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"da Silva TM ; Munhoz RP ; Alvarez C ; Naliwaiko K ; Kiss A ; Andreatini R ; Ferraz AC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2008.03.008 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntiparkinson Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBrazil/epidemiology\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nComorbidity\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diet therapy/*drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLevodopa/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMineral Oil/therapeutic use\r\nParkinson Disease/drug therapy/*epidemiology/*psychology\r\nPersonality Inventory\r\nPilot Projects\r\nPlacebos\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales/statistics & numerical data\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"da Silva TM, Munhoz RP, Alvarez C, Naliwaiko K, Kiss A, Andreatini R, and Ferraz AC (2008) Depression in Parkinson's disease: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study of omega-3 fatty-acid supplementation..

Although converging studies suggest an antidepressant effect of PUFAs, there is limited evidence directly linking the neuro-immune modulating features of PUFAs to the antidepressant actions. METHODS: Therefore, we assessed the effects of fish oil (FO) supplementation on behavioral changes, inflammatory cytokine expression and oxidative reactions in frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats following repeated peripheral immune challenge by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 2 weeks (500 μg/kg every other day). RESULTS: Repeated LPS administration induced the rats to a depressive-like state and increased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including 1L-1β, 1L-6 and TNF-α, in frontal cortex and hippocampus. FO supplementation attenuated the LPS-induced abnormal behavior and brain inflammatory response. Concurrent with the antidepressant action, FO also reduced LPS-induced oxidative reactions and neural apoptosis in the rat brain, as evidenced by decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) production, increased catalase activities and inhibited pro-apoptotic protein Bax mRNA expression. In addition, FO inhibited activation of NF-κB and iNOS induced by LPS. Interestingly, we found FO suppressed the activation of the inflammasome NLRP3 and ionotropic purinergic receptor P2X7R evoked by LPS, suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory mechanism for PUFAs. Besides, FO also restored the LPS-induced neurochemical disturbance, especially the balance between serotonin and kynurenine branches of tryptophan metabolism, which is tightly associated with depression. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide novel insights into the antidepressant action of PUFAs and further strengthen the link between inflammation and depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dang R ; Zhou X ; Tang M ; Xu P ; Gong X ; Liu Y ; Jiao H ; Jiang P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00394-016-1373-z ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBiomarkers/metabolism\r\nCytokines/genetics/metabolism\r\nDepression/etiology/metabolism/*prevention & control\r\n*Dietary Supplements/adverse effects\r\nFish Oils/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nGene Expression Regulation/drug effects\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism/pathology\r\nHumans\r\nLipopolysaccharides/toxicity\r\nNLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein/genetics/metabolism\r\nNerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism\r\nNeurogenic Inflammation/immunology/pathology/physiopathology/*prevention & \r\n      control\r\nNeurons/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism/pathology\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nReceptors, Purinergic P2X7/genetics/metabolism\r\nDepression\r\nLipopolysaccharide\r\nNeuroinflammation\r\nNeurotransmitters\r\nP2X7R\r\nω-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dang R, Zhou X, Tang M, Xu P, Gong X, Liu Y, Jiao H, and Jiang P (2018) Fish oil supplementation attenuates neuroinflammation and alleviates depressive-like behavior in rats submitted to repeated lipopolysaccharide..

Considering previous reports on clinical benefits of omega-3 fatty acids in major depression and HRQoL in other patient populations, this study examined effects of omega-3 fatty acids on depression and HRQoL in chronic HD patients. In this randomized placebo-controlled trial, 40 adult patients with a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score of ≥16 and HD vintage of at least 3 months were randomized to ingest 6 soft-gel capsules of either omega-3 fatty acids (180 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 120 mg docosahexaenoic acid in each capsule) or corresponding placebo, daily for 4 months. At baseline and after 4 months, 2 questionnaires of BDI and the Medical Outcome Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey were completed by each patient. Although baseline BDI score was comparable between the 2 groups, it was significantly lower in the omega-3 group compared with the placebo group at the end of the study (P = 0.008). Except for mental health, social functioning, and general health, other domains of HRQoL showed significant improvement in the omega-3 group compared with the placebo group at month 4 of the study (P < 0.05 for all). Regression analysis revealed that ameliorated BDI score by omega-3 treatment had considerable role in the improvement of overall HRQoL score, physical and mental component dimensions, and score of physical functioning, role-physical, and bodily pain. Supplemental use of omega-3 fatty acids in HD patients with depressive symptoms seems to be efficacious in improving depressive symptoms and HRQoL.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dashti-Khavidaki S ; Gharekhani A ; Khatami MR ; Miri ES ; Khalili H ; Razeghi E ; Hashemi-Nazari SS ; Mansournia MA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/MJT.0000000000000078 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/therapeutic use\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Quality of Life\r\nRegression Analysis\r\nRenal Dialysis/*psychology\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dashti-Khavidaki S, Gharekhani A, Khatami MR, Miri ES, Khalili H, Razeghi E, Hashemi-Nazari SS, and Mansournia MA (2014) Effects of omega-3 fatty acids on depression and quality of life in maintenance hemodialysis patients..

However, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain largely unknown. Increasing evidence suggests that the vast repertoire of commensal bacteria within the gut plays a critical role in regulating various biological processes in the brain and may contribute to neuropsychiatric disease risk. The present study determined the contribution of DHA on anxiety and depressive-like behaviors through modulation of the gut microbiota in a paradigm of social isolation. Adult male and female mice were subjected to social isolation for 28days and then placed either on a control diet or a diet supplemented with 0.1% or 1.0% DHA. Fecal pellets were collected both 24h and 7days following the introduction of the new diets. Behavioral testing revealed that male mice fed a DHA diet, regardless of dose, exhibited reduced anxiety and depressive-like behaviors compared to control fed mice while no differences were observed in female mice. As the microbiota-brain-axis has been recently implicated in behavior, composition of microbial communities were analyzed to examine if these sex-specific effects of DHA may be associated with changes in the gut microbiota (GM). Clear sex differences were observed with males and females showing distinct microbial compositions prior to DHA supplementation. The introduction of DHA into the diet also induced sex-specific interactions on the GM with the fatty acid producing a significant effect on the microbial profiles in males but not in females. Interestingly, levels of Allobaculum and Ruminococcus were found to significantly correlate with the behavioral changes observed in the male mice. Predictive metagenome analysis using PICRUSt was performed on the fecal samples collected from males and identified enrichment in functional KEGG pathway terms relevant to processes such as the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and antioxidant metabolism. These results indicate that DHA alters commensal community composition and produces beneficial effects on anxiety and depressive-like behaviors in a sex-specific manner. The present study provides insight into the mechanistic role that gut microbes may play in the regulation of anxiety and depressive-like behaviors and how dietary intervention can modulate these effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Davis DJ ; Hecht PM ; Jasarevic E ; Beversdorf DQ ; Will MJ ; Fritsche K ; Gillespie CH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbi.2016.09.003 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnxiety/psychology\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nDepression/psychology\r\nDiet\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/*pharmacology\r\nFeces/chemistry\r\nFemale\r\nFood Preferences/drug effects\r\nGastrointestinal Microbiome\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nMicrobiota/*drug effects\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nSex Characteristics\r\n*Social Isolation\r\nAnxiety\r\nDepression\r\nDocosahexaenoic acid\r\nMicrobiome\r\nSex difference","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Davis DJ, Hecht PM, Jasarevic E, Beversdorf DQ, Will MJ, Fritsche K, and Gillespie CH (2017) Sex-specific effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the microbiome and behavior of socially-isolated mice..

METHODS: We conducted a metabolome-wide association study of MDD with 249 metabolomic measures available in the UK Biobank (n = 29,757). We then applied two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization and colocalization analysis to identify potentially causal relationships between each metabolite and MDD. RESULTS: A total of 191 metabolites tested were significantly associated with MDD (false discovery rate-corrected p < .05), which decreased to 129 after adjustment for likely confounders. Lower abundance of omega-3 fatty acid measures and a higher omega-6 to omega-3 ratio showed potentially causal effects on liability to MDD. There was no evidence of a causal effect of MDD on metabolite levels. Furthermore, genetic signals associated with docosahexaenoic acid colocalized with loci associated with MDD within the fatty acid desaturase gene cluster. Post hoc Mendelian randomization of gene-transcript abundance within the fatty acid desaturase cluster demonstrated a potentially causal association with MDD. In contrast, colocalization analysis did not suggest a single causal variant for both transcript abundance and MDD liability, but rather the likely existence of two variants in linkage disequilibrium with one another. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that decreased docosahexaenoic acid and increased omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids ratio may be causally related to MDD. These findings provide further support for the causal involvement of fatty acids in MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Davyson E ; Shen X ; Gadd DA ; Bernabeu E ; Hillary RF ; McCartney DL ; Adams M ; Marioni R ; McIntosh AM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopsych.2023.01.027 ","Keywords":"Colocalization\r\nDepression\r\nFatty acids\r\nMendelian randomization\r\nMetabolome\r\nMultiomics","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Davyson E, Shen X, Gadd DA, Bernabeu E, Hillary RF, McCartney DL, Adams M, Marioni R, and McIntosh AM (2023) Metabolomic Investigation of Major Depressive Disorder Identifies a Potentially Causal Association With Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids..

Based on this, we have investigated the central effects of the essential oil isolated from A. zerumbet leaves. METHODS: Mice were treated once with 50 or 100 mg/kg of the essential oil, intraperitoneally, 30 min before being submitted to behavioural models of: locomotor activity (open-field), catalepsy, anxiety (elevated plus maze), depression (forced swimming test and tail suspension tests) as well as apomorphine-induced stereotypy. KEY FINDINGS: Results showed a dose-related decrease on locomotor activity and apomorphine-induced stereotypy. There was a decrease to the order of 55% of the grooming behaviour with both doses studied. The essential oil 100 mg/kg increased cataleptic activity (167%) and the immobility time in the forced swimming and tail suspension tests. Pretreatment with haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg, i.p.) alone also decreased locomotion, increased cataleptic activity and immobility time in the tail suspension test. No alterations in the elevated plus maze test were registered. CONCLUSIONS: The essential oil of A. zerumbet leaves had depressant and possible antipsychotic activity, since it could reverse the stereotypy induced by apomorphine, presenting effects comparable with those obtained with haloperidol treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"de Araújo FY ; Silva MI ; Moura BA ; de Oliveira GV ; Leal LK ; Vasconcelos SM ; Viana GS ; de Moraes MO ; de Sousa FC ; Macêdo DS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1211/jpp/61.11.0012 ","Keywords":"Alpinia/*chemistry\r\nAnimals\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/pharmacology\r\nAnxiety\r\nApomorphine\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nCatalepsy\r\nCentral Nervous System/*drug effects\r\nCentral Nervous System Depressants/pharmacology\r\nDopamine Antagonists/pharmacology\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nHaloperidol/pharmacology\r\nMaze Learning\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/*drug effects\r\nOils, Volatile/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nPlant Extracts/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nTail","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"de Araújo FY, Silva MI, Moura BA, de Oliveira GV, Leal LK, Vasconcelos SM, Viana GS, de Moraes MO, de Sousa FC, and Macêdo DS (2009) Central nervous system effects of the essential oil of the leaves of Alpinia zerumbet in mice..

Some studies have shown that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are involved in the development of major depression. Since most depressed patients do not achieve complete remission of symptoms, new therapeutic alternatives are needed and omega-3 has been highlighted in this scenario. Therefore, we have investigated the effects of omega-3 on behavioral and biochemical parameters in rats submitted to chronic mild stress (CMS). Male Wistar rats were submitted to CMS for 40 days. After the CMS period, we administered a 500 mg/kg dose of omega-3 orally, once a day, for 7 days. The animals submitted to CMS presented anhedonia, had no significant weight gain, presented increased levels of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation, and inhibition of complex I and IV activities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The treatment with omega-3 did not reverse anhedonia; however, it reversed weight change, increased lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation levels, and partially reversed the inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. The findings support studies that state that major depression is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, and that omega-3 supplementation could reverse some of these changes, probably due to its antioxidant properties.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"de Mello AH ; Gassenferth A ; Schraiber Rde B; Souza Lda R; Florentino D ; Danielski LG ; Cittadin-Soares Eda C; Fortunato JJ ; Petronilho F ; Quevedo J ; Rezin GT ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11011-014-9577-5 ","Keywords":"Anhedonia/*drug effects/physiology\r\nAnimals\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects/physiology\r\nBody Weight/drug effects/physiology\r\nBrain/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nElectron Transport Complex I/metabolism\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMalondialdehyde/metabolism\r\nOxidative Stress/*drug effects/physiology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nStress, Psychological/*metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"de Mello AH, Gassenferth A, Schraiber Rde B, Souza Lda R, Florentino D, Danielski LG, Cittadin-Soares Eda C, Fortunato JJ, Petronilho F, Quevedo J, and Rezin GT (2014) Effects of omega-3 on behavioral and biochemical parameters in rats submitted to chronic mild stress..

This report reviews the etiology and pathophysiology of depression, and explores the role of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) as a possible treatment. In seeking to understand depression, genetic factors and environmental influences have been extensively investigated. Research has led to several hypotheses for the pathophysiological basis of depression but a definitive pathogenic mechanism, or group thereof, has hitherto remained equivocal. To date, treatment has been based on the monoamine hypothesis and hence, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been the most widely used class of medication. In the last decade, there has been considerable interest in n-3 PUFAs and their role in depression. These fatty acids are critical for development and function of the central nervous system. Increasing evidence from epidemiological, laboratory, and randomized placebo-controlled trials suggests deficiency of dietary n-3 PUFAs may contribute to development of mood disorders, and supplementation with n-3 PUFAs may provide a new treatment option. Conclusions based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses of published trials to date vary. Research into the effects of n-3 PUFAs on depressed mood is limited. Furthermore, results from such have led to conflicting conclusions regarding the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs in affecting reduction in symptoms of depression.

Chronic consumption of a saturated high-fat diet (HFD) elicits anxiodepressive behavior in a manner linked to metabolic dysfunction and neuroinflammation in mice. Dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) can improve both metabolic and mood impairments by relieving inflammation. Despite these findings, the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation on energy homeostasis, anxiodepressive behavior, brain lipid composition, and gliosis in the diet-induced obese state are unclear. METHODS: Male C57Bl/6J mice were fed a saturated high-fat diet (HFD) or chow for 20 weeks. During the last 5 weeks mice received daily gavage (\"supplementation\") of fish oil (FO) enriched with equal amounts of docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or control corn oil. Food intake and body weight were measured throughout while additional metabolic parameters and anxiety- and despair-like behavior (elevated-plus maze, light-dark box, and forced swim tasks) were evaluated during the final week of supplementation. Forebrain lipid composition and markers of microglia activation and astrogliosis were assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and real-time PCR, respectively. RESULTS: Five weeks of FO supplementation corrected glucose intolerance and attenuated hyperphagia in HFD-induced obese mice without affecting adipose mass. FO supplementation also defended against the anxiogenic and depressive-like effects of HFD. Brain lipids, particularly anti-inflammatory PUFA, were diminished by HFD, whereas FO restored levels beyond control values. Gene expression markers of brain reactive gliosis were supressed by FO. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementing a saturated HFD with FO rich in EPA and DHA corrects glucose intolerance, inhibits food intake, suppresses anxiodepressive behaviors, enhances anti-inflammatory brain lipids, and dampens indices of brain gliosis in obese mice. Together, these findings support increasing dietary n-3 PUFA for the treatment of metabolic and mood disturbances associated with excess fat intake and obesity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Demers G ; Roy J ; Machuca-Parra AI ; Dashtehei Pour Z; Bairamian D ; Daneault C ; Rosiers CD ; Ferreira G ; Alquier T ; Fulton S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41366-020-0623-6 ","Keywords":"Adipose Tissue/drug effects\r\nAnimals\r\nAnxiety\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\n*Brain/drug effects/metabolism\r\nBrain Chemistry/drug effects\r\nDepression\r\nDiet, High-Fat/*adverse effects\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFish Oils/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\n*Obesity/metabolism/psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Demers G, Roy J, Machuca-Parra AI, Dashtehei Pour Z, Bairamian D, Daneault C, Rosiers CD, Ferreira G, Alquier T, and Fulton S (2020) Fish oil supplementation alleviates metabolic and anxiodepressive effects of diet-induced obesity and associated changes in brain lipid composition in mice..

However, whether dietary supplementation with LC n-3 PUFA protects from the development of mood disorders is still a matter of debate. In the present study, we studied the effect of a two-month exposure to isocaloric diets containing n-3 PUFAs in the form of relatively short-chain (SC) (6% of rapeseed oil, enriched in α-linolenic acid (ALA)) or LC (6% of tuna oil, enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) PUFAs on behavior and synaptic plasticity of mice submitted or not to a chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), previously reported to alter emotional and social behavior, as well as synaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). First, fatty acid content and lipid metabolism gene expression were measured in the NAc of mice fed a SC (control) or LC n-3 (supplemented) PUFA diet. Our results indicate that LC n-3 supplementation significantly increased some n-3 PUFAs, while decreasing some n-6 PUFAs. Then, in another cohort, control and n-3 PUFA-supplemented mice were subjected to CSDS, and social and emotional behaviors were assessed, together with long-term depression plasticity in accumbal medium spiny neurons. Overall, mice fed with n-3 PUFA supplementation displayed an emotional behavior profile and electrophysiological properties of medium spiny neurons which was distinct from the ones displayed by mice fed with the control diet, and this, independently of CSDS. Using the social interaction index to discriminate resilient and susceptible mice in the CSDS groups, n-3 supplementation promoted resiliency. Altogether, our results pinpoint that exposure to a diet rich in LC n-3 PUFA, as compared to a diet rich in SC n-3 PUFA, influences the NAc fatty acid profile. In addition, electrophysiological properties and emotional behavior were altered in LC n-3 PUFA mice, independently of CSDS. Our results bring new insights about the effect of LC n-3 PUFA on emotional behavior and synaptic plasticity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Di Miceli M ; Martinat M ; Rossitto M ; Aubert A ; Alashmali S ; Bosch-Bouju C ; Fioramonti X ; Joffre C ; Bazinet RP ; Layé S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ijms23126650 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nDiet\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/metabolism/pharmacology\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid\r\nFatty Acids/metabolism\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3/metabolism/pharmacology\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nMice\r\n*Nucleus Accumbens/metabolism\r\nALA\r\nDHA\r\nEPA\r\nchronic social defeat stress\r\nemotional behavior\r\nlipid microarray\r\nlong-term depression\r\nwhole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Di Miceli M, Martinat M, Rossitto M, Aubert A, Alashmali S, Bosch-Bouju C, Fioramonti X, Joffre C, Bazinet RP, and Layé S (2022) Dietary Long-Chain n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Supplementation Alters Electrophysiological Properties in the Nucleus Accumbens and Emotional Behavior in Naïve and Chronically Stressed Mice..

The brain-gut-microbiota axis has been described as a new paradigm for advancing understanding and treatment of the disorder. There is now over-whelming evidence to support the fact that gut microbes have a major impact on central neurochemistry and behaviour, especially stress related disorders such as depression. Recent studies indicate that patients with depression have a gut dysbiosis. The reason for this dysbiosis is uncertain. Over recent decades, dietary patterns in Europe and elsewhere have undergone major compositional changes, with increased intakes of red meat, high fat foods, and refined sugars. Individuals who consume a Mediterranean diet have lower rates of depression and a recent study suggests that a Mediterranean diet may have antidepressant properties. Assuming this to be the case, which components of the Mediterranean diet mediate the effects? Highly levels of polyphenols or polyunsaturated fatty acids are obvious candidates. We in the MyNewGut consortium recommend that patients with depression or vulnerability to depression should be encouraged to enhance a plant-based diet with a high content of grains/fibres and fish.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dinan TG ; Stanton C ; Long-Smith C ; Kennedy P ; Cryan JF ; Cowan CSM ; Cenit MC ; van der Kamp JW ; Sanz Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.clnu.2018.11.010 ","Keywords":"*Affect\r\nBrain Chemistry\r\n*Depression\r\n*Diet\r\n*Dysbiosis\r\n*Gastrointestinal Microbiome\r\nHumans\r\nDepression\r\nDiet\r\nDysbiosis\r\nGut microbiota\r\nMyNewGut","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dinan TG, Stanton C, Long-Smith C, Kennedy P, Cryan JF, Cowan CSM, Cenit MC, van der Kamp JW, and Sanz Y (2019) Feeding melancholic microbes: MyNewGut recommendations on diet and mood..

The mechanisms of depression are vast and not fully understood, and as a result current treatment of depression is suboptimal. Aberrant sphingolipid metabolism has been observed in some cases of depression, specifically alterations in ceramide concentrations. The role of ceramides and other sphingolipids in depression is a novel concept. This review summarizes and evaluates the current state of evidence for a role of ceramides in depression pathophysiology and the potential for novel depression pharmacotherapies targeting ceramide metabolism. METHODS: Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched through October 2016 for English-language studies using combinations of the search terms: ceramide, depression, sphingolipid, and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Of the 489 articles screened, 14 were included in the qualitative synthesis of this review article. Pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggest that ceramide species may contribute to depression pathophysiology. In human studies, ceramides C18:0 and C20:0 are the species most strongly linked to depression. Evidence for altered ceramide metabolism in depression is present, but data for a causal role of ceramides in depression are lacking. LIMITATIONS: This review was limited by potential reporting bias. Furthermore, a lack of specificity of which ceramides were altered in depression was common. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacotherapy targeting ceramide metabolism may be a novel treatment option for depression.

This review summarizes the results of various pharmacological (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, cytokine inhibitors, corticosteroids, statins, minocycline, N-acetyl cysteine, omega-3 fatty acids and probiotics) and non-pharmacological interventions (electroconvulsive therapy, physical exercise and psychological therapy) and outlines their efficacy and discusses potential challenges. Both conventional and non-conventional anti-inflammatory drugs showed promising results according to the specific group of patients. The pre-existing pro-inflammatory status was, in most cases, a predictor for clinical efficacy and, in some cases, a correlation between clinical improvement and changes in various biomarkers was found. Some of the non-pharmacological interventions (physical exercise and electroconvulsive therapy) have also showed beneficial effects for depressive patients with elevated inflammatory markers. Treatments with anti-inflammatory action may improve clinical outcomes in depression, at least for some categories of patients, thus opening the way for a future personalised approach to patients with unipolar depression regarding the inflammation-related mechanism.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dogaru IA ; Puiu MG ; Manea M ; Dionisie V ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/brainsci12101403 ","Keywords":"N-acetyl cysteine\r\nNSAID\r\nanti-inflammatory\r\ncytokine inhibitor\r\ndepression\r\nelectroconvulsive therapy\r\nminocycline\r\nomega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nphysical therapy\r\nstatins","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dogaru IA, Puiu MG, Manea M, and Dionisie V (2022) Current Perspectives on Pharmacological and Non-Pharmacological Interventions for the Inflammatory Mechanism of Unipolar Depression..

In addition to the well-known drugs (second-generation antipsychotics, levothyroxine, dopaminergic agents, etc.) for augmentation, investigations suggest that several nutraceuticals and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs may be effective and safe as adjunct therapeutic agents to conventional ADs. To identify such active ingredients we first performed a systematic literature search using PubMed and then conducted both backward and forward citation searches. For the PubMed search, we used the following combinations of keywords: 1) \"adjunctive\" + \"therapy\" + \"antidepressant\"; 2) \"add-on\" + \"therapy\" + \"antidepressant\"; 3) \"supplementation\" + \"therapy\" + \"antidepressant\". As a result of those efforts, we found more than 20 agents (e.g. S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine; folate; ω-3 fatty acids; curcumin; N-acetylcysteine; saffron; 5-hydroxytryptophan; NSAIDs) that are supposedly effective in the augmentation of standard AD treatment. We discussed the possible mechanisms of the antidepressant actions of those agents, as well as the preclinical and clinical evidence for their efficacy as stand-alone and adjunct treatments for MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dome P ; Tombor L ; Lazary J ; Gonda X ; Rihmer Z ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.brainresbull.2018.12.015 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBiological Products/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDiet/methods\r\nDiet Therapy/methods\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination/methods\r\nHumans\r\nMinerals/therapeutic use\r\nNonprescription Drugs/therapeutic use\r\nAdd-on\r\nAdjunctive\r\nAntidepressant\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nMicronutrients\r\nNutraceutical","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dome P, Tombor L, Lazary J, Gonda X, and Rihmer Z (2019) Natural health products, dietary minerals and over-the-counter medications as add-on therapies to antidepressants in the treatment of major depressive disorder: a review..

Furthermore, recent preclinical studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that in rodents, chronic stress and the stress hormone cortisol cause oxidative damage to mitochondrial function and membrane lipids in the brain. Mitochondria play a key role in synaptic neurotransmitter signaling by providing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), mediating lipid and protein synthesis, buffering intracellular calcium, and regulating apoptotic and resilience pathways. Membrane lipids are similarly essential to central nervous system (CNS) function because cholesterol, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and sphingolipids form a lipid raft region, a special lipid region on the membrane that mediates neurotransmitter signaling through G-protein-coupled receptors and ion channels. Low serum cholesterol levels, low antioxidant capacity, and abnormal early morning cortisol levels are biomarkers consistently associated with both depression and suicidal behaviors. In this review, we summarize the manner in which nutrients can protect against oxidative damage to mitochondria and lipids in the neuronal circuits associated with cognitive and affective behaviors. These nutrients include ω3 fatty acids, antioxidants (vitamin C and zinc), members of the vitamin B family (Vitamin B12 and folic acid), and magnesium. Accumulating data have shown that these nutrients can enhance neurocognitive function, and may have therapeutic benefits for depression and suicidal behaviors. A growing body of studies suggests the intriguing possibility that regular consumption of these nutrients may help prevent the onset of mood disorders and suicidal behaviors in vulnerable individuals, or significantly augment the therapeutic effect of available antidepressants. These findings have important implications for the health of both military and civilian populations.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Du J ; Zhu M ; Bao H ; Li B ; Dong Y ; Xiao C ; Zhang GY ; Henter I ; Rudorfer M ; Vitiello B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/10408398.2013.876960 ","Keywords":"Antioxidants/administration & dosage\r\nCholesterol/blood\r\nDepression/*diet therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nHydrocortisone/blood\r\nMagnesium/administration & dosage\r\nMilitary Personnel\r\nMitochondria/*physiology\r\nNeurotransmitter Agents/*metabolism\r\nOxidative Stress/drug effects\r\nSignal Transduction\r\nSleep Deprivation/complications\r\nStress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*diet therapy\r\nStress, Psychological/complications\r\nVitamin B Complex/administration & dosage\r\n*Suicide Prevention\r\nVitamin\r\nlipid\r\noxidative stress\r\nsuicide\r\nsynaptic plasticity\r\nzinc","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Du J, Zhu M, Bao H, Li B, Dong Y, Xiao C, Zhang GY, Henter I, Rudorfer M, and Vitiello B (2016) The Role of Nutrients in Protecting Mitochondrial Function and Neurotransmitter Signaling: Implications for the Treatment of Depression, PTSD, and Suicidal Behaviors..

This study was designed to investigate the antidepressant-like effect of essential oil isolated from T. ciliata Roem. var. yunnanensis. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to analyze the compositions of essential oil. The immobility time in the forced swimming test (FST), tail suspending test (TST), and open field test (OFT) were used to evaluate the antidepressive effects of essential oil. Furthermore, chronic mild stress (CMS) rats were established, and contents of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the brain were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-electron capture detector (HPLC-ECD). Western blotting was performed to investigate the effects of essential oil on the expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein in rats' brain. The GC-MS analysis showed that the main components of essential oil were estragole (6.16 %), β-elemene (24.91 %), β-cubebene (14.29 %), and γ-elemene (8.05 %). The results from the FST and TST demonstrated that the immobility time could be significantly reduced by essential oil (10, 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg), without accompanying changes in ambulation when assessed in the OFT. Additionally, the contents of DA, NE, 5-HT, and BDNF in the hippocampus of CMS rats could be increased by treatment with essential oil at doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg. All these results suggested that essential oil could be considered as a new candidate for curing depressive disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Duan D ; Chen L ; Yang X ; Tu Y ; Jiao S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11418-014-0878-0 ","Keywords":"Allylbenzene Derivatives\r\nAnimals\r\nAnisoles/analysis/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/analysis/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nBrain/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDopamine/metabolism\r\nHindlimb Suspension\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMeliaceae/*chemistry\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred ICR\r\nNorepinephrine/metabolism\r\nOils, Volatile/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\n*Phytotherapy\r\nPlant Extracts/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nRats\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nSesquiterpenes/analysis/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nSwimming","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Duan D, Chen L, Yang X, Tu Y, and Jiao S (2015) Antidepressant-like effect of essential oil isolated from Toona ciliata Roem. var. yunnanensis..

Depressive symptoms are common in older adults and are associated with cognitive decline and greater risk for transitioning to major depression. Oxidative stress may be implicated in the pathophysiology of major depression and can be measured in vivo using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy via the neurometabolite glutathione (GSH). Evidence suggests ω-3 fatty acid (FA) supplementation may prevent depression and directly affect GSH concentration. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of ω-3 FA supplementation on in vivo GSH concentration in older adults at risk for depression. METHODS: Fifty-one older adults at risk for depression were randomized to receive either four 1000-mg ω-3 FA supplements daily (containing eicosapentaenoic acid 1200 mg plus docosahexaenoic acid 800 mg) or placebo (four 1000-mg paraffin oil placebo capsules daily) for 12 wk. Participants underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as medical, neuropsychological, and self-report assessments at baseline and after 12 wk of supplementation. GSH was measured in the thalamus and calculated as a ratio to creatine. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire. RESULTS: Compared with the group given the ω-3 FA supplements, the placebo group had greater change in the GSH-to-creatine ratio in the thalamus (t = 2.00; P = 0.049) after the 12 wk intervention. This increase was in turn associated with a worsening of depressive symptoms (r = 0.43; P = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptom severity in older adults appears to be associated with increased brain levels of GSH, a key marker of oxidative stress. Importantly, ω-3 FA supplementation may attenuate oxidative stress mechanisms, thereby offering benefits for depression prevention.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Duffy SL ; Lagopoulos J ; Cockayne N ; Lewis SJ ; Hickie IB ; Hermens DF ; Naismith SL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.nut.2015.04.019 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nCognition Disorders/complications\r\nCreatine/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/etiology/*prevention & control\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage\r\nFemale\r\nGlutathione/*metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOxidative Stress/drug effects\r\nThalamus/*metabolism\r\nGlutathione\r\nMagnetic resonance spectroscopy\r\nMajor depression\r\nThalamus\r\nω-3 fatty acid","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Duffy SL, Lagopoulos J, Cockayne N, Lewis SJ, Hickie IB, Hermens DF, and Naismith SL (2015) The effect of 12-wk ω-3 fatty acid supplementation on in vivo thalamus glutathione concentration in patients \"at risk\" for major depression..

Alterations of the GBA have been revealed in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis and making it a promising therapeutic target. Whilst research in this field is still in its infancy, a number of studies revealed that MS patients are more likely to exhibit modified microbiota, altered levels of short-chain fatty acids, and enhanced intestinal permeability. Both clinical and preclinical trials in patients with MS and animal models revealed that the administration of probiotic bacteria might improve cognitive, motor, and mental behaviors by modulation of GBA molecular pathways. According to the newest data, supplementation with probiotics may be associated with slower disability progression, reduced depressive symptoms, and improvements in general health in patients with MS. Herein, we give an overview of how probiotics supplementation may have a beneficial effect on the course of MS and its animal model. Hence, interference with the composition of the MS patient's intestinal microbiota may, in the future, be a grip point for the development of diagnostic tools and personalized microbiota-based adjuvant therapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dziedzic A ; Saluk J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ijms232214478 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Gastrointestinal Microbiome/physiology\r\n*Multiple Sclerosis\r\n*Probiotics/therapeutic use\r\nSymbiosis\r\n*Microbiota\r\nadjuvant therapy\r\nbacterial-derived metabolites\r\ndepression\r\ngut-brain axis\r\nmultiple sclerosis\r\nprobiotics","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dziedzic A, and Saluk J (2022) Probiotics and Commensal Gut Microbiota as the Effective Alternative Therapy for Multiple Sclerosis Patients Treatment..

Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI) are frequently used as the first line of pharmacology treatment for depression but have several negative qualities, i.e. a delay or absence of effectiveness and negative side-effects. Therefore, there is a growing need for new nutraceutical-based strategies to blunt the effects of adverse-life events.Objectives: This study aimed to use the maternal separation model in rats to test the efficacy of fish oil dietary supplementation, on its own and in conjunction with the SSRI anti-depressant fluoxetine, as a treatment for depressive and anxiety-like symptoms associated with early life stress.Methods: Behavioural tests (open field test, elevated plus maze test and forced swim test) and biochemical markers (corticosterone, BDNF, brain fatty acids and short chain fatty acids) were used to analyse the effects of the dietary treatments. Gut microbial communities and relating metabolites (SCFA) were analysed to investigate possible changes in the microbiota-gut-brain axis.Results: Maternally separated rats showed depressive-like behaviours in the forced swim and open field tests. These behaviours were prevented significantly by fluoxetine administration and in part by fish oil supplementation. Associated biochemical changes reported include altered brain fatty acids, significantly lower plasma corticosterone levels (AUC) and reduced brain stem serotonin turnover, compared to untreated, maternally separated (MS) rats. Untreated MS animals had significantly lower ratios of SCFA producers such as Caldicoprobacteraceae, Streptococcaceae, Rothia, Lachnospiraceae_NC2004_group, and Ruminococcus_2, along with significantly reduced levels of total SCFA compared to non-separated animals. Compared to untreated MS animals, animals fed fish oil had significantly higher Bacteroidetes and Prevotellaceae and reduced levels of butyrate, while fluoxetine treatment resulted in significantly higher levels of Neochlamydia, Lachnoclostridium, Acetitomaculum and Stenotrophomonas and, acetate and propionate.Conclusion: Despite the limitations in extrapolating from animal behavioural data and the notable differences in pharmacokinetics between rodents and humans, the results of this study provide a further advancement into the understanding of some of the complex systems within which nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals effect the microbiota-gut-brain axis.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Egerton S ; Donoso F ; Fitzgerald P ; Gite S ; Fouhy F ; Whooley J ; Dinan TG ; Cryan JF ; Culloty SC ; Ross RP ; Stanton C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/1028415X.2020.1753322 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nRats\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\n*Fish Oils/pharmacology\r\nMaternal Deprivation\r\n*Stress, Psychological\r\n*Depression\r\n*Anxiety\r\nDHA\r\nEPA\r\nOmega 3\r\nSCFA\r\ndepression\r\ngut-brain axis\r\nmaternal separation model\r\nmetabolites","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Egerton S, Donoso F, Fitzgerald P, Gite S, Fouhy F, Whooley J, Dinan TG, Cryan JF, Culloty SC, Ross RP, and Stanton C (2022) Investigating the potential of fish oil as a nutraceutical in an animal model of early life stress..

This burden may be overwhelming in low income countries, although there are insufficient data. Most antidepressant formulations are predicated on the monoamine, neuroendocrine and neuro-inflammation hypotheses, with little or no cognizance to other neurochemicals altered in depression. A nutritional strategy with or without conventional antidepressants is recommended, as nutrition plays vital roles in the onset, severity and duration of depression, with poor nutrition contributing to its pathogenesis. This review discusses nutritional potentials of utilizing omega-3 fatty acids, proteins, vitamins, minerals and herbs or their phytochemicals in the management of depression with the aim of reducing depression burden. Literature search of empirical data in books and journals in data bases including but not limited to PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science and Google Scholar that might contain discussions of sampling were sought, their full text obtained, and searched for relevant content to determine eligibility. Omega-3 fatty and amino acids had significant positive anti-depression outcomes, while vitamins and minerals although essential, enhanced omega-3 fatty and amino acids activities. Some herbs either as whole extracts or their phytochemicals/metabolites had significant positive anti-depression efficacy. Nutrition through the application of necessary food classes or herbs as well as their phytochemicals, may go a long way to effectively manage depression. This therefore will provide inexpensive, natural, and non-invasive therapeutic means with reduced adverse effects that can also be applied alongside clinical management. This nutritional strategy should be given more attention in research, assessment and treatment for those with depression and other mental illness in low income countries, especially in Africa.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ekong MB ; Iniodu CF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ibneur.2021.06.002 ","Keywords":"Depression burden\r\nDepression classification\r\nDepression treatment\r\nFood\r\nHerbal extracts.

Geranium oil and anise oil were chosen for such a study. The aim of this research was to establish the geranium oil and anise oil effect to ameliorate CMS-related symptoms. Methods This research included 80 male albino rats each group of 10 rats and the animals were divided into two major groups: normal and CMS. The normal group was subdivided into four (control, geranium oil, anise oil and venlafaxine drug) subgroups treated orally with saline, geranium oil, anise oil and venlafaxine drug, respectively, for 4 weeks. The CMS group was subdivided into four (CMS without any treatment, CMS + geranium oil, CMS + anise oil and CMS + venlafaxine drug) subgroups treated orally with geranium oil, anise oil and venlafaxine drug, respectively, for 4 weeks. Results The sucrose consumption in sucrose preference test, the distance traveled test and center square entries test were decreased, while center square duration test, immobility time in tail suspension test and floating time in forced swimming test were increased in CMS. The superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase and catalase levels decreased but malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels increased in brain cerebral cortex and hippocampus areas in CMS.

Major depression dramatically affects the function of the central nervous system and degrades the quality of life, especially in old age. Several mechanisms underlie the pathophysiology of depressive illness, since it has a multifactorial etiology. Human and animal studies have demonstrated that depression is mainly associated with imbalances in neurotransmitters and neurotrophins, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis alterations, brain volume changes, neurogenesis dysfunction, and dysregulation of inflammatory pathways. Also the gut microbiota may influence mental health outcomes. Although depression is not a consequence of normal aging, depressive disorders are common in later life, even if often undiagnosed or mis-diagnosed in old age. When untreated, depression reduces life expectancy, worsens medical illnesses, enhances health care costs and is the primary cause of suicide among older people. To date, the underpinnings of depression in the elderly are still to be understood, and the pharmacological treatment is the most commonly used therapy. OBJECTIVE: Since a sedentary lifestyle and poor eating habits have recently emerged as crucial contributors to the genesis and course of depression, in the present review, we have focused on the effects of physical activity and omega-3 fatty acids on depressive illness in the elderly. RESULTS: A growing literature indicates that both exercise and dietary interventions can promote mental health throughout one's lifespan. CONCLUSION: There thus emerges the awareness that an active lifestyle and a balanced diet may constitute valid low-cost prevention strategies to counteract depressive illness in the elderly.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Farioli Vecchioli S; Sacchetti S ; Nicolis di Robilant V; Cutuli D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1570159X15666170912113852 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAnimals\r\nBrain/*metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/*metabolism/therapy\r\nExercise/*physiology/*psychology\r\nExercise Therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nAging\r\ndepression\r\ndiet\r\nexercise\r\nlate-life depression\r\nmood disorders\r\nomega-3 fatty acids\r\nphysical activity","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Farioli Vecchioli S, Sacchetti S, Nicolis di Robilant V, and Cutuli D (2018) The Role of Physical Exercise and Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Depressive Illness in the Elderly..

Their synthetic pathway is located in peroxisomes and endoplasmic reticulum. The rate-limiting enzymes are in the peroxisomes and are induced by docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Plasmalogens often contain arachidonic acid (AA) or DHA at the sn-2 position of the glycerol moiety. The receptor-mediated hydrolysis of plasmalogens by cytosolic plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 generates AA or DHA and lysoplasmalogens. AA is metabolized to eicosanoids. The mechanism of signaling with DHA is not known. The plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 differs from other intracellular phospholipases A2 in molecular mass, kinetic properties, substrate specificity, and response to glycosaminoglycans, gangliosides, and sialoglycoproteins. A major portion of [3H]DHA incorporated into neural membranes is found at the sn-2 position of ethanolamine glycerophospholipids. Studies with a mutant cell line defective in plasmalogen biosynthesis indicate that the incorporation of DHA is reduced in this RAW 264.7 cell line by 50%. In contrast, the incorporation of AA remains unaffected. This is reversed completely when the growth medium is supplemented with sn-1-hexadecylglycerol, suggesting that DHA can be selectively targeted for incorporation into plasmalogens. We suggest that deficiencies of DHA and plasmalogens in peroxisomal disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) may be responsible for abnormal signal transduction associated with learning disability, cognitive deficit, and visual dysfunction. These abnormalities in the signal-transduction process can be partially corrected by supplementation with a diet enriched with DHA.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Farooqui AA ; Horrocks LA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1385/jmn:16:2-3:263 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nArachidonic Acids/metabolism\r\nBrain/*metabolism\r\nCalcium Signaling\r\nCattle\r\nCell Line\r\nCell Membrane/metabolism\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/*metabolism/therapeutic use\r\nEndoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nIsoenzymes/*metabolism\r\nMacrophages/metabolism\r\nMembrane Lipids/metabolism\r\nMice\r\nNerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism\r\nPeroxisomes/metabolism\r\nPhosphatidylethanolamines/metabolism\r\nPhospholipases A/*metabolism\r\nPhospholipases A2\r\nPlasmalogens/*metabolism\r\nRats\r\nReceptors, Cell Surface/metabolism\r\nSignal Transduction\r\nSubstrate Specificity\r\nZellweger Syndrome/diet therapy/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Farooqui AA, and Horrocks LA (2001) Plasmalogens, phospholipase A2, and docosahexaenoic acid turnover in brain tissue..

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between anxiety disorder and fatty acids' intake in women. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 300 women aged 18-49 attending healthcare centers. Dietary exposure was measured by a 168-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). To determine the status of anxiety, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS) questionnaire was used. Based on the total score of anxiety, the participants were divided into two groups of without anxiety (< 8) and with anxiety (≥ 8). The relationship between fatty acids intake and odd ratio (OR) for anxiety was analyzed by simple logistic regression. RESULTS: About 37.7% of individuals reported anxiety. After adjustment for covariates, an increase in the OR for anxiety was observed across the quintuples of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (OR 3.17; 95% CI 1.43-7.00; p-trend = 0.005). In addition, higher intakes of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) (OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.05-0.44; p-trend = 0.001), oleic acid (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.09-0.67; p-trend = 0.002), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (OR 0.07; 95% CI 0.02-0.23; p-trend < 0.001), and n-3:n-6 poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.24-1.03; p-trend = 0.02) were found to be related with lower OR of anxiety. CONCLUSION: Intake of SFAs was positively related to anxiety disorder, whereas MUFAs, oleic acid, ALA, and n-3: n-6 PUFAs intake were inversely related to anxiety score. For investigating the association of fat intake and anxiety disorder, DFQ may be a useful measure.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fatemi F ; Siassi F ; Qorbani M ; Sotoudeh G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12991-020-00264-9 ","Keywords":"Anxiety disorder\r\nDietary fat quality\r\nFatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fatemi F, Siassi F, Qorbani M, and Sotoudeh G (2020) Higher dietary fat quality is associated with lower anxiety score in women: a cross-sectional study..

Due to significant heterogeneity, there are remarkable differences in how patients respond to treatment. A primary objective of psychiatric research is to identify biological markers that could be used to better predict and enhance responses to antidepressant treatments. Diet impacts various aspects of health, including depression. The fatty acid composition of the Western diet, which has a high ratio of n-6:n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, is associated with increased incidence of depression. The brain is rich in lipids, and dietary fatty acids act within specific brain regions to regulate processes that impact emotional behavior. This manuscript reviews existing evidence demonstrating brain region-specific fatty acid profiles, and posits that specific fatty acids may serve as predictive biomarkers of response to antidepressants. Furthermore, increasing blood levels of certain fats, such as n-3s, via dietary intervention may serve as an adjunct to improve the efficacy of antidepressants.

The present study examined the impact of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) supplementation in an early phase of the brain development with the goal of preventing or even attenuating the occurrence of stress-related behaviors such as depressive-like behaviors, anxiety and cognitive dysfunctions in male rats subjected to restraint stress. Our results indicated that the supplementation regimen successfully counteracted the anxiogenic effects of stress as evidenced by the rats' increased exploration time in the aversive arms of the elevated plus maze. The forced swimming test indicated that immobility and swimming were more deeply influenced by PUFAs supplementation, thereby demonstrating an antidepressant effect. Furthermore, cognitive function was shown to be intensely affected by restraint stress, but the effects were surprisingly counteracted by the PUFAs supplementation. Lastly, plasmatic corticosterone levels were demonstrated to be drastically increased by the restraint stress; however, PUFAs supplementation promoted a reduction of this stress-related hormone to levels that were comparable to those observed in the control group. Our results suggested that the mechanisms underlying these effects are possibly associated with the reduction of corticosterone levels promoted by the PUFAs supplementation in the stress-induced animals. Further studies to examine the participation of PUFAs in mediating different behaviors in rats subjected to restraint stress are warranted.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ferraz AC ; Delattre AM ; Almendra RG ; Sonagli M ; Borges C ; Araujo P ; Andersen ML ; Tufik S ; Lima MM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2010.12.028 ","Keywords":"Affect/drug effects\r\nAnimals\r\n*Anti-Anxiety Agents\r\n*Antidepressive Agents\r\nAnxiety/psychology\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nCognition/*drug effects\r\nCorticosterone/blood\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/*psychology\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMaze Learning/drug effects\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nRestraint, Physical\r\nStress, Psychological/*drug therapy/*psychology\r\nSwimming/psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ferraz AC, Delattre AM, Almendra RG, Sonagli M, Borges C, Araujo P, Andersen ML, Tufik S, and Lima MM (2011) Chronic ω-3 fatty acids supplementation promotes beneficial effects on anxiety, cognitive and depressive-like behaviors in rats subjected to a restraint stress protocol..

We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science to November 2020. Two independent investigators extracted the information, evaluated the methodological quality of SRMAs using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR2), and rated the certainty of evidence using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Either a fixed-effects or a random-effects model was used to recalculate the effect sizes and 95%CIs, depending on the number of trials. Overall, 28 SRMAs of RCTs, reporting 124 outcomes from 672 RCTs with 273,523 participants were considered eligible for the present umbrella review. Our results demonstrated evidence of moderate to high certainty that omega-3 supplementation reduced the risk of pre-eclampsia and low-birth weight and improved head circumference when used in pregnant women, and reduced severe retinopathy of prematurity and cholestasis when used in infancy. There were also favorable effects on preterm delivery, pre-natal and post-partum depression, glycemic control and inflammation markers in pregnant women, and sensitization to peanuts, positive skin prick tests, anthropometric measures, language development, visual acuity, and duration of ventilation in infants (GRADE = low). Our findings suggested that omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy can exert favorable effects against pre-eclampsia, low-birth weight, pre-term delivery, and post-partum depression, and can improve anthropometric measures, immune system, and visual activity in infants and cardiometabolic risk factors in pregnant mothers.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Firouzabadi FD ; Shab-Bidar S ; Jayedi A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.phrs.2022.106100 ","Keywords":"Birth Weight\r\n*Depression, Postpartum/chemically induced/drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfant\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nLactation\r\nMeta-Analysis as Topic\r\n*Pre-Eclampsia\r\nPregnancy\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nSystematic Reviews as Topic\r\nDocosahexaenoic acid (PubChem CID:445580)\r\nEicosapentaenoic acid (PubChem CID:446284)\r\nInfancy\r\nLactation\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nOmega-3\r\nPregnancy\r\nRandomized trials","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Firouzabadi FD, Shab-Bidar S, and Jayedi A (2022) The effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation in pregnancy, lactation, and infancy: An umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomized trials..

Along with dietary intake, nutrition can also be obtained from \"nutrient supplements\", such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, amino acids and pre/probiotic supplements. Recently, a large number of meta-analyses have emerged examining nutrient supplements in the treatment of mental disorders. To produce a meta-review of this top-tier evidence, we identified, synthesized and appraised all meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy and safety of nutrient supplements in common and severe mental disorders. Our systematic search identified 33 meta-analyses of placebo-controlled RCTs, with primary analyses including outcome data from 10,951 individuals. The strongest evidence was found for PUFAs (particularly as eicosapentaenoic acid) as an adjunctive treatment for depression. More nascent evidence suggested that PUFAs may also be beneficial for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, whereas there was no evidence for schizophrenia. Folate-based supplements were widely researched as adjunctive treatments for depression and schizophrenia, with positive effects from RCTs of high-dose methylfolate in major depressive disorder. There was emergent evidence for N-acetylcysteine as a useful adjunctive treatment in mood disorders and schizophrenia. All nutrient supplements had good safety profiles, with no evidence of serious adverse effects or contraindications with psychiatric medications. In conclusion, clinicians should be informed of the nutrient supplements with established efficacy for certain conditions (such as eicosapentaenoic acid in depression), but also made aware of those currently lacking evidentiary support. Future research should aim to determine which individuals may benefit most from evidence-based supplements, to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Firth J ; Teasdale SB ; Allott K ; Siskind D ; Marx W ; Cotter J ; Veronese N ; Schuch F ; Smith L ; Solmi M ; Carvalho AF ; Vancampfort D ; Berk M ; Stubbs B ; Sarris J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/wps.20672 ","Keywords":"N-acetylcysteine\r\nNutrient supplements\r\nadjunctive treatment\r\nattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\r\ndepression\r\neicosapentaenoic acid\r\nmethylfolate\r\nomega-3\r\npolyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nschizophrenia\r\nvitamin D","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Firth J, Teasdale SB, Allott K, Siskind D, Marx W, Cotter J, Veronese N, Schuch F, Smith L, Solmi M, Carvalho AF, Vancampfort D, Berk M, Stubbs B, and Sarris J (2019) The efficacy and safety of nutrient supplements in the treatment of mental disorders: a meta-review of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials..

But a substantial number of patients declines taking pharmaceutical medication to avoid side effects. Therefore, an alternative herbal medication is needed. Clinical studies demonstrated that lavender oil capsules, termed Lasea®, have an anxiolytic effect comparable to Lorazepam and significantly reduce insomnia and agitation in non-depressed patients. Therefore, the aim of this retrospective case series was to analyze the effectiveness of Lasea® for patients with MDD and symptoms of anxiety, insomnia and psychomotor agitation. DESIGN: Eight cases were analyzed retrospectively regarding the dosage, length of treatment, possible side effects and effectiveness of Lasea®. SETTING: All cases were treated at the Department of Psychiatry at Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin in a naturalistic setting. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Effectiveness was measured by a change in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) total score and subscores. RESULTS: In 6 cases, the combination of Lasea® and an antidepressant resulted in a reduction of MDD. Lasea® also reduced agitation in 6 cases. Psychological anxiety was reduced in 5, somatic anxiety in 4 cases whereas sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia improved in 3 cases each. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that Lasea® reduces some of the anxiety related symptoms and sleep disturbances in MDD patients. Furthermore Lasea® significantly reduces psychomotor agitation. Additionally, the results indicate a significant global improvement stemming from the combinational therapy of Lasea® and antidepressant medication.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fißler M ; Quante A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ctim.2013.11.008 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nFemale\r\nHealth Status Indicators\r\nHumans\r\nLavandula\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOils, Volatile/*therapeutic use\r\nPlant Oils/*therapeutic use\r\nPsychomotor Agitation/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nSleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nAgitation\r\nAnxiety\r\nHerbal pharmacotherapy\r\nInsomnia\r\nLavendula oil\r\nMajor depressive disorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fißler M, and Quante A (2014) A case series on the use of lavendula oil capsules in patients suffering from major depressive disorder and symptoms of psychomotor agitation, insomnia and anxiety..

This study examined the association of Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence and MD components with mental health during pregnancy. METHODS: This secondary analysis of the GESTAFIT trial included longitudinal data from 152 pregnant women. Dietary habits were assessed with a food frequency questionnaire, and MD adherence was derived from it using the Mediterranean Food pattern. Psychological ill-being (i.e., negative affect, anxiety, and depression) and well-being (i.e., emotional intelligence, resilience, positive affect) were assessed with the Spanish version of well-established self-reported questionnaires. Cross-sectional (16th gestational week [g.w.]) and longitudinal associations (34th g.w.) between MD and mental health were studied using linear regression models. RESULTS: A greater MD adherence was inversely associated with negative affect and anxiety; and positively associated with emotional regulation, resilience and positive affect at the 16th and 34th g.w. (|β| ranging from 0.179 to 0.325, all p < 0.05). Additionally, a higher intake of whole grain cereals, fruits, vegetables, fish, olive oil and nuts, and a lower intake of red meat and subproducts and sweets were associated with lower negative affect, anxiety, depression and higher emotional regulation, resilience and positive affect throughout gestation (|β| ranging from 0.168 to 0.415, all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A higher intake of whole grain cereals, fruits, vegetables, fish, olive oil and nuts, together with a lower intake of red meat and sweets, resulted in a higher MD adherence, which was associated with a better mental health during pregnancy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Flor-Alemany M ; Baena-García L ; Migueles JH ; Henriksson P ; Löf M ; Aparicio VA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11136-022-03121-2 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\n*Diet, Mediterranean/psychology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nOlive Oil\r\nPregnancy\r\nQuality of Life/psychology\r\nVegetables\r\nAnxiety\r\nDepression\r\nDiet\r\nMediterranean\r\nMental Health\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnant women","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Flor-Alemany M, Baena-García L, Migueles JH, Henriksson P, Löf M, and Aparicio VA (2022) Associations of Mediterranean diet with psychological ill-being and well-being throughout the pregnancy course: The GESTAFIT project..

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present letter was to highlight recent findings in the field to guide nutritional interventions in psychiatry. METHOD: An overview of the most recent meta-analyses in the field of psychonutrition in severe mental disorders has been carried out. RESULTS: The Mediterranean diet showed the best evidence for effectiveness in diminishing the incidence of depressive symptomatology Complementary agents were found to be associated with lower depression levels (even in psychiatric populations): omegas 3 fatty acids, vitamin D, methylfolate and S-adenosylmethionine, all being found in high rates in the Mediterranean diet. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) has also been found to be associated with lower depression. Moreover, major depression has been associated with inflammatory disturbances and a diet with a low Dietary Inflammatory Index has also been shown to be associated with lower depression. These effects may be mediated by microbiota modifications and probiotic supplementation has been recently shown to be effective in the treatment of depression. A high protein diet may also be particularly useful in psychiatry. The high protein diet has shown effectiveness in weight loss and increasing satiety with no evidence for deleterious effects in subjects without chronic conditions like renal failure, diabetes or cardiovascular disease. A reduction of 20% of calorific intake +/- intermittent fasting (i.e. fasting for 12 to 16 h per day) may also improve microbiota and therefore psychiatric conditions. CONCLUSION: In light of these findings, diet modifications appear to be an underutilized tool with which to improve the mental and physical health of psychiatric patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fond G ; Young AH ; Godin O ; Messiaen M ; Lançon C ; Auquier P ; Boyer L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2019.11.092 ","Keywords":"Diet\r\nDiet, Healthy\r\n*Diet, Mediterranean\r\nFasting\r\nHumans\r\n*Mental Disorders/therapy\r\nMental Health","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fond G, Young AH, Godin O, Messiaen M, Lançon C, Auquier P, and Boyer L (2020) Improving diet for psychiatric patients : High potential benefits and evidence for safety..

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of Omega-3 supplementation on some cognitive and physiological parameters in healthy subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects were tested at the beginning of the experiment and after 35 days. In this period they were supplemented with Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. A group was supplemented with olive oil (placebo). Tests involving different types of attention were used, i.e. Alert, Go/No-Go, Choice and Sustained Attention. For each test, the reaction time, the event-related potentials by electroencephalogram (EEG) and the electromyography (EMG) of the forefinger flexor muscle were recorded. The Profile of Mood States test (POMS) was also administered. RESULTS: Blood analyses showed that after Omega-3 supplementation the arachidonic acid/eicosapentaenoic acid ratio (AA/EPA) was strongly reduced. The mood profile was improved after Omega-3 with increased vigour and reduced anger, anxiety and depression states. This was associated with an effect on reactivity with a reduction of reaction time in the Go/No-Go and Sustained Attention tests. The latency of EMG activation was concomitantly reduced in the same tests plus Choice. An EEG frequency shift towards the theta and alpha band were recorded in all the tests after Omega-3. CONCLUSIONS: Omega-3 supplementation is associated with an improvement of attentional and physiological functions, particularly those involving complex cortical processing. These findings are discussed in terms of the influence of Omega-3 on the central nervous system.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fontani G ; Corradeschi F ; Felici A ; Alfatti F ; Migliorini S ; Lodi L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2362.2005.01570.x ","Keywords":"Action Potentials/physiology\r\nAdult\r\nAffect/*physiology\r\nArachidonic Acid/blood\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid\r\nElectroencephalography/methods\r\nElectromyography/methods\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/blood\r\nFemale\r\nFingers\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMuscle, Skeletal/physiology\r\nReaction Time","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fontani G, Corradeschi F, Felici A, Alfatti F, Migliorini S, and Lodi L (2005) Cognitive and physiological effects of Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in healthy subjects..

Hence, complementary therapies such as nutritional considerations could be advantageous. The antidepressant potential of olive oil has been proved in observational studies. OBJECTIVE: The effect of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) on depression symptoms and cortisol and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in patients with depression was examined. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a double-blind randomized controlled trial conducted on 73 patients suffering from major depressive disorder in Shiraz, Iran, in 2016. INTERVENTION: The patients were randomly assigned to intervention (EVOO) and control (sunflower oil) groups and consumed 25 mL/d of the corresponding oil for 52 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression symptoms were assessed by Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and 7-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-7). Salivary cortisol levels were determined immediately after awakening and 30 minutes later. Cortisol awakening response and the area under the curve with respect to ground and increase were computed. Serum BDNF concentrations were also measured. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Statistical analysis was conducted based on intention-to-treat and per-protocol approaches. Within-group changes were examined with repeated measures (for BDI-II and HAMD-7) and with paired t test (for other variables). Between-group comparisons were performed with analysis of covariance after adjustment for confounding factors. RESULTS: In intention-to-treat analysis, HAMD-7 score was the only variable with significant changes within and between groups, the latter as a greater decline in EVOO group (P = .001). BDI-II score did not show significant change in either group but the between-group comparison revealed a significant difference (P = .021). EVOO showed antidepressant effect in severely depressed patients (P = .017 for BDI-II and 0.008 for HAMD-7) but not in mild/moderate depression category. Serum BDNF concentrations, salivary cortisol levels at immediately after awakening (T(0)) and 30 minutes later, cortisol awakening response, the area under the curve with respect to ground and increase did not change within or between groups. Results of per-protocol analysis were not different. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggested beneficial effects of EVOO on depression symptoms in patients with severe depression but not in those with mild to moderate depression. The effects were significant from both statistical and clinical points of view.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Foshati S ; Ghanizadeh A ; Akhlaghi M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jand.2021.07.016 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*blood\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/metabolism/*therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nHydrocortisone/*metabolism\r\nIran\r\nMale\r\nOlive Oil/*administration & dosage\r\nSaliva/chemistry\r\nSunflower Oil/administration & dosage\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nBrain-derived neurotrophic factor\r\nDepression\r\nOlive oil\r\nSalivary cortisol","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Foshati S, Ghanizadeh A, and Akhlaghi M (2022) Extra-Virgin Olive Oil Improves Depression Symptoms Without Affecting Salivary Cortisol and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in Patients With Major Depression: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial..

This hypothesis suggests a vice-versa; that it is a gradual impairment and ultimate failure of specific memory systems that may underpin the onset and continuation of a depressive illness. So particular memory systems of the brain may have a greater role to play in clinical depression and associated anxiety than is generally recognised. A common feature of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is that it affects patients' short-term memory adversely. However, in line with the hypothesis, it is suggested that the mechanism of action of successful ECT treatment is that it facilitates the repair and reactivation of particular memory systems. One link that has some bearing on this hypothesis is that of Omega 3 fish oil. It has in some cases been observed to aid recovery of depression and possibly prevent relapse. It has been shown to improve memory.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Frais AT ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.mehy.2007.01.046 ","Keywords":"Depression/*complications/*therapy\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy/*methods\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nMemory/*drug effects\r\nMemory Disorders/*etiology/*prevention & control\r\nModels, Neurological","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Frais AT (2007) Depression and the causal role of specific memory system degenerations: link may be supported by reported therapeutic benefits of Omega 3 fatty acids..

Omega-3 fatty acids may prove to be efficacious in a number of psychiatric disorders. Mood disorders have been associated with abnormalities in fatty acid composition. Several lines of evidence suggest that diminished omega-3 fatty acid concentrations are associated with mood disorders. Clinical data are not yet available regarding omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of major depression. However, one double-blind treatment trial has been conducted in bipolar disorder. Also, substantial evidence does exist supporting a potential role of omega-3 fatty acids in schizophrenia, although treatment data are needed. A case has been reported in which a patient with schizophrenia was successfully treated with omega-3 fatty acids. Controlled studies are necessary to explore the potential treatment of schizophrenia with omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids may also be helpful in the treatment of dementia.

In consideration of its prevalence and consequences, the treatment and prevention of perinatal depression should be important public health priorities. Omega-3 fatty acids are attractive for consideration in perinatal women, due to known health benefits for the mother and baby. Antidepressant medications may pose risks in utero and in breastfeeding. METHODS: MEDLINE and manual searches were conducted. RESULTS: Epidemiological and preclinical data support a role of omega-3 fatty acids in perinatal depression. Two studies failed to support a role of omega-3 fatty acids for postpartum depression prophylaxis, although one included a small sample, and the other utilized a low dosage. Two pilot studies suggest good tolerability and potential efficacy in the acute treatment of perinatal depression. CONCLUSIONS: Further research studies are warranted to determine the role of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of perinatal depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Freeman MP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.plefa.2006.07.007 ","Keywords":"Depression, Postpartum/drug therapy/prevention & control\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/therapeutic use\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/physiology/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nPregnancy/*psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Freeman MP (2006) Omega-3 fatty acids and perinatal depression: a review of the literature and recommendations for future research..

RESULTS: Across groups, pretreatment Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) mean scores were 18.1 and 19.1 respectively; post-treatment mean scores were 9.3 and 10.0. Percent decreases on the EPDS and HRSD were 51.5% and 48.8%, respectively; changes from baseline were significant within each group and when combining groups. Groups did not significantly differ in pre- or post-test scores, or change in scores. The treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: This study was limited by small sample size and lack of placebo group.

PARTICIPANTS: The authors of this article were invited participants in the Omega-3 Fatty Acids Subcommittee, assembled by the Committee on Research on Psychiatric Treatments of the American Psychiatric Association (APA). EVIDENCE: Published literature and data presented at scientific meetings were reviewed. Specific disorders reviewed included major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, dementia, borderline personality disorder and impulsivity, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Meta-analyses were conducted in major depressive and bipolar disorders and schizophrenia, as sufficient data were available to conduct such analyses in these areas of interest. CONSENSUS PROCESS: The subcommittee prepared the manuscript, which was reviewed and approved by the following APA committees: the Committee on Research on Psychiatric Treatments, the Council on Research, and the Joint Reference Committee. CONCLUSIONS: The preponderance of epidemiologic and tissue compositional studies supports a protective effect of omega-3 EFA intake, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in mood disorders. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials demonstrate a statistically significant benefit in unipolar and bipolar depression (p = .02). The results were highly heterogeneous, indicating that it is important to examine the characteristics of each individual study to note the differences in design and execution. There is less evidence of benefit in schizophrenia. EPA and DHA appear to have negligible risks and some potential benefit in major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, but results remain inconclusive in most areas of interest in psychiatry. Treatment recommendations and directions for future research are described. Health benefits of omega-3 EFA may be especially important in patients with psychiatric disorders, due to high prevalence rates of smoking and obesity and the metabolic side effects of some psychotropic medications.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Freeman MP ; Hibbeln JR ; Wisner KL ; Davis JM ; Mischoulon D ; Peet M ; Keck PE Jr; Marangell LB ; Richardson AJ ; Lake J ; Stoll AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/jcp.v67n1217 ","Keywords":"Epidemiologic Studies\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/*drug therapy/*prevention & control\r\nTissue Distribution","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Freeman MP, Hibbeln JR, Wisner KL, Davis JM, Mischoulon D, Peet M, Keck PE Jr, Marangell LB, Richardson AJ, Lake J, and Stoll AL (2006) Omega-3 fatty acids: evidence basis for treatment and future research in psychiatry..

Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) treatments are widely used, accessible, and understudied for well-defined psychiatric indications. Women are more likely than men to both suffer from MDD and use CAM. METHODS: A PubMed/Medline search was conducted to assess the evidence base for commonly utilized CAM treatments, MDD, and perinatal depression. RESULTS: Among CAM treatments, omega-3 fatty acids have received the most specific study in terms of epidemiological, preclinical, and clinical research for perinatal depression. Three randomized placebo-controlled trials have been conducted in which investigators assessed omega-3 fatty acids vs. placebo for perinatal depression, with conflicting results. CAM interventions that can be easily added to a treatment plan with little risk and general health benefits for most women include omega-3 fatty acids, exercise, and folate, although data are insufficient at this time to recommend any of these as monotherapy for perinatal depression. S-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe) and bright light therapy may be reasonable to consider based on the evidence in MDD. St. John's Wort requires further study with regard to safety in pregnancy, and drug interactions can be a potential problem. DISCUSSION: Further study is required to elucidate the role of CAM treatments for perinatal depression, and the clinical context of perinatal depression requires safe, effective, and accessible treatment options.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Freeman MP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2008.06.017 ","Keywords":"Acupuncture Therapy\r\nComplementary Therapies/*methods\r\nDepression, Postpartum/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHerbal Medicine\r\nHumans\r\nHypericum/chemistry\r\nPhototherapy\r\nPhytotherapy/methods\r\nPlant Extracts/therapeutic use\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Freeman MP (2009) Complementary and alternative medicine for perinatal depression..

Psychiatrists, therefore, need to inquire about and discuss the use of these treatments with patients and offer up-to-date information about risks and benefits. However, evidence-based information is limited. To address the needs of practicing psychiatrists and the public, the American Psychiatric Association has set up a task force on CAM to review the evidence for the efficacy and safety of CAM treatments in major depressive disorder (MDD). Some CAM treatments have known general health benefits but currently equivocal evidence of benefit in MDD. Exercise, folate, and omega-3 fatty acids can be recommended to most patients with MDD for their general health benefits, and St John's wort and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM-e) may be appropriate to treat depression in some patients. In all instances, use of CAM therapies should not take the place of diagnostic assessment and evaluation for MDD and consideration of standard treatment use. Patients should receive advice about all available treatment options, including risks, benefits, and possible drug interactions, as well as full evaluations and regular monitoring.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Freeman MP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.8157su1c.01 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAdvisory Committees\r\nComplementary Therapies/*methods\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*therapy\r\nHumans\r\nNational Institutes of Health (U.S.)\r\nPsychiatry/methods\r\nSocieties, Medical\r\nTerminology as Topic\r\nUnited States","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Freeman MP (2009) Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM): considerations for the treatment of major depressive disorder..

PARTICIPANTS: Authors of this report were invited participants in the American Psychiatric Association's Task Force on Complementary and Alternative Medicine. EVIDENCE: The group reviewed the literature on individual CAM treatments for MDD, methodological considerations, and future directions for CAM in psychiatry. Individual CAM treatments were reviewed with regard to efficacy in MDD, as well as risks and benefits. Literature searches included MEDLINE and PsycINFO reviews and manual reference searches; electronic searches were limited to English-language publications from 1965 to January 2010 (but manual searches were not restricted by language). Treatments were selected for this review on the basis of (1) published randomized controlled trials in MDD and (2) widespread use with important clinical safety or public health significance relevant to psychiatric practice. An action plan is presented based on needs pertaining to CAM and psychiatry. CONSENSUS PROCESS: Consensus was reached by group conferences. Written iterations were drafted and sent out among group members prior to discussion, resolution of any differences of interpretation of evidence, and final approval. CONCLUSIONS: A review of randomized controlled trials for commonly used CAM treatments such as omega-3 fatty acids, St John's wort (Hypericum), folate, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), acupuncture, light therapy, exercise, and mindfulness psychotherapies revealed promising results. More rigorous and larger studies are recommended. Each CAM treatment must be evaluated separately in adequately powered controlled trials. At this time, several CAM treatments appear promising and deserve further study. The greatest risk of pursuing a CAM therapy is the possible delay of other well-established treatments. Clinical, research, and educational initiatives designed to focus on CAM in psychiatry are clearly warranted due to the widespread use of CAM therapies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Freeman MP ; Fava M ; Lake J ; Trivedi MH ; Wisner KL ; Mischoulon D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.10cs05959blu ","Keywords":"Acupuncture Therapy\r\nAdvisory Committees\r\nComplementary Therapies/*methods\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nHerbal Medicine\r\nHumans\r\nHypericum\r\nMeditation/methods\r\nMethionine/therapeutic use\r\nPhototherapy\r\nPsychiatry/methods\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nUnited States","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Freeman MP, Fava M, Lake J, Trivedi MH, Wisner KL, and Mischoulon D (2010) Complementary and alternative medicine in major depressive disorder: the American Psychiatric Association Task Force report..

DATA SOURCES: Eligible studies were first identified using searches of PubMed/MEDLINE, restricted to English, by cross-referencing the search term placebo with each of the antidepressants (those that had received letters of approval by the US, Canadian, or EU drug regulatory agencies for the treatment of MDD) and selected CAM agents. These searches were limited to articles published between January 1, 1980, and September 15, 2009 (inclusive). Reference lists from identified studies were also searched for studies eligible for inclusion. STUDY SELECTION: We selected RCTs for MDD that included validated diagnostic assessment and baseline/outcome measures of illness severity. Assessment was limited to widely used CAM agents most frequently studied in RCTs with pill placebo: St John's wort, omega-3 fatty acids, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe). DATA SYNTHESIS: Of eligible publications, 173 reported results of 1 trial, and 5 included > 1 trial, representing a total of 185 RCTs. Patient variables, including illness severity, were similar across CAM and antidepressant RCTs, except for a higher proportion of women in CAM studies (P = .0003). Random-effects meta-analysis indicated that both antidepressant and CAM monotherapy resulted in superior response rates compared with placebo. Placebo-response rates were significantly lower for patients enrolled in CAM versus antidepressant RCTs (P = .002). Meta-regression analyses yielded no significant differences in the relative risk of prematurely discontinuing therapy due to any reason between active treatment and placebo for antidepressant and CAM RCTs, although discontinuation due to adverse events was higher in antidepressant RCTs compared to CAM RCTs (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Participants in CAM trials were more likely to be female and to have a lower placebo-response rate compared to those in standard antidepressant trials for MDD. Trials of standard antidepressants and CAM therapies were composed of patients with similar depression severity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Freeman MP ; Mischoulon D ; Tedeschini E ; Goodness T ; Cohen LS ; Fava M ; Papakostas GI ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.10r05976blu ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nComplementary Therapies/*methods/standards\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nPlacebos\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use\r\nSample Size\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Freeman MP, Mischoulon D, Tedeschini E, Goodness T, Cohen LS, Fava M, and Papakostas GI (2010) Complementary and alternative medicine for major depressive disorder: a meta-analysis of patient characteristics, placebo-response rates, and treatment outcomes relative to standard antidepressants..

Secondary outcomes were assessed for vasomotor symptoms (or hot flashes). METHODS: After a single-blind placebo lead-in, participants received 8 weeks of treatment with open-label omega-3 fatty acid capsules (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, 2 g/d). The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was the primary outcome measure. Hot flashes were monitored prospectively using daily diaries and the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale. Blood samples for plasma pretreatment and posttreatment essential fatty acid assays were obtained. Because of the small sample size, data were analyzed using nonparametric techniques. RESULTS: Of 20 participants treated with omega-3 fatty acids, 19 (95%) completed the study. None discontinued because of adverse effects. The pretreatment and final mean MADRS scores were 24.2 and 10.7, respectively, reflecting a significant decrease in MADRS scores (P < 0.0001). The response rate was 70% (MADRS score decrease of ≥50%), and the remission rate was 45% (final MADRS score of ≤). Responders had significantly lower pretreatment docosahexaenoic acid levels than nonresponders did (P = 0.03). Hot flashes were present in 15 (75%) participants. Among those with hot flashes at baseline, the number of hot flashes per day improved significantly from baseline (P = 0.02) and Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale scores decreased significantly (P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: These data support further study of omega-3 fatty acids for major depressive disorder and hot flashes in women during the menopausal transition.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Freeman MP ; Hibbeln JR ; Silver M ; Hirschberg AM ; Wang B ; Yule AM ; Petrillo LF ; Pascuillo E ; Economou NI ; Joffe H ; Cohen LS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/gme.0b013e3181f2ea2e ","Keywords":"Depressive Disorder, Major/blood/*drug therapy\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/blood\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHot Flashes/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nMenopause/*psychology\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPlacebos\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Freeman MP, Hibbeln JR, Silver M, Hirschberg AM, Wang B, Yule AM, Petrillo LF, Pascuillo E, Economou NI, Joffe H, and Cohen LS (2011) Omega-3 fatty acids for major depressive disorder associated with the menopausal transition: a preliminary open trial..

An association with APOEomega4 carriers and neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD has also been suggested. OBJECTIVE: To determine effects of dietary omega3 supplementation to AD patients with mild to moderate disease on psychiatric and behavioral symptoms, daily functions and a possible relation to APOEgenotype. METHODS: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial where 204 AD patients (74+/-9 years) with acetylcholine esterase inhibitor treatment and a MMSE>15 points were randomized to daily intake of 1.7 g DHA and 0.6 g EPA (omega3 group) or placebo for 6 months. Then, all received the omega3 supplementation for 6 more months. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were measured with Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS). Caregivers burden and activities of daily living (Disability Assessment for Dementia, DAD) were also assessed. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-four patients fulfilled the trial. 72% were APOEomega4 carriers. No significant overall treatment effects on neuropsychiatric symptoms, on activities of daily living or on caregiver's burden were found. However, significant positive treatment effects on the scores in the NPI agitation domain in APOEomega4 carriers (p=0.006) and in MADRS scores in non-APOEomega4 carriers (p=0.005) were found. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with omega3 in patients with mild to moderate AD did not result in marked effects on neuropsychiatric symptoms except for possible positive effects on depressive symptoms (assessed by MADRS) in non-APOEomega4 carriers and agitation symptoms (assessed by NPI) in APOEomega4 carriers.

In a recent clinical trial, Silexan also showed antidepressant effects in patients suffering from mixed anxiety-depression (ICD-10 F41.2). Since preclinical data explaining antidepressant properties of Silexan are missing, we decided to investigate if Silexan also shows antidepressant-like effects in vitro as well as in vivo models. METHODS: We used the forced swimming test (FST) in rats as a simple behavioral test indicative of antidepressant activity in vivo. As environmental events and other risk factors contribute to depression through converging molecular and cellular mechanisms that disrupt neuronal function and morphology-resulting in dysfunction of the circuitry that is essential for mood regulation and cognitive function-we investigated the neurotrophic properties of Silexan in neuronal cell lines and primary hippocampal neurons. RESULTS: The antidepressant activity of Silexan (30 mg/kg BW) in the FST was comparable to the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (20 mg/kg BW) after 9-day treatment. Silexan triggered neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis in 2 different neuronal cell models and led to a significant increase in synaptogenesis in primary hippocampal neurons. Silexan led to a significant phosphorylation of protein kinase A and subsequent CREB phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: Taken together, Silexan demonstrates antidepressant-like effects in cellular as well as animal models for antidepressant activity. Therefore, our data provides preclinical evidence for the clinical antidepressant effects of Silexan in patients with mixed depression and anxiety.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Friedland K ; Silani G ; Schuwald A ; Stockburger C ; Koch E ; Nöldner M ; Müller WE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1055/a-1293-8585 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nCREB-Binding Protein/metabolism\r\nCell Culture Techniques\r\nCyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nImipramine/pharmacology\r\nLavandula\r\nOils, Volatile/*pharmacology\r\nPlant Oils/*pharmacology\r\nPregabalin/pharmacology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Friedland K, Silani G, Schuwald A, Stockburger C, Koch E, Nöldner M, and Müller WE (2021) Neurotrophic Properties of Silexan, an Essential Oil from the Flowers of Lavender-Preclinical Evidence for Antidepressant-Like Properties..

METHODS: This study was a 12 week, randomized trial of Ω3 versus placebo and IF-PEP versus active monitoring (AM) using a 2 × 2 design (Ω3 + PEP: n = 5; Ω3 + AM: n = 5; placebo + PEP: n = 7; placebo + AM: n = 6). Twenty-three youth ages 7-14 with BP-NOS or CYC were recruited via community advertisements and clinician referrals. Participants could be taking stable medication for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and sleep aids, but no other psychotropics. Independent evaluators assessed participants at screen, baseline, and 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 weeks. Primary outcome measures were the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders (K-SADS) Depression (KDRS) and Mania (KMRS) Rating Scales, Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R), and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Ω3/placebo conditions were double-blind; independent evaluators were blind to psychotherapy condition. RESULTS: Most participants (83%) completed the 12 week trial. Side effects were uncommon and mild. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated significant improvement in depressive symptoms (KDRS) for combined treatment relative to placebo and AM (p = 0.01, d = 1.70). Across groups, manic symptoms improved over time without significant treatment effects. Effect of IF-PEP on child depression compared with AM was medium (d = 0.63, CDRS-R) to large (d = 1.24, KDRS). Effect of Ω3 on depression was medium (d = 0.48, KDRS). CONCLUSION: IF-PEP and Ω3 are well tolerated and associated with improved mood symptoms among youth with BP-NOS and CYC.

Ω3 versus placebo was double-masked. Evaluators masked to condition assessed depressive severity at baseline (randomization) and at 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 weeks using the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised. Side effects were either absent or mild. PEP was administered with 74% fidelity. Remission was 77%, Ω3+PEP; 61%, PEP+placebo; 44%, Ω3; 56%, placebo. Intent-to-treat analyses found small to medium effects of combined treatment (d = .29) and Ω3 monotherapy (d = .42), but negligible effect for PEP+placebo (d < .10), all compared to placebo alone. Relative to placebo, youth with fewer social stressors responded better to Ω3 (p = .04), PEP (p = .028), and their combination (p = .035), and those with maternal depression responded better to PEP (p = .020) than did those without maternal depression. Remission rates were favorable compared to other studies of psychotherapy and comparable to an existing randomized controlled trial of Ω3; results warrant further evaluation in a larger sample. Ω3 was well tolerated. Active treatments show significantly more placebo-controlled depression improvement in the context of maternal depression and fewer stressors, suggesting that they may benefit depression with a more endogenous than environmental origin.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fristad MA ; Vesco AT ; Young AS ; Healy KZ ; Nader ES ; Gardner W ; Seidenfeld AM ; Wolfson HL ; Arnold LE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15374416.2016.1233500 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nChild\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/*therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nPilot Projects\r\nPsychotherapy/*methods\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fristad MA, Vesco AT, Young AS, Healy KZ, Nader ES, Gardner W, Seidenfeld AM, Wolfson HL, and Arnold LE (2019) Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of Omega-3 and Individual-Family Psychoeducational Psychotherapy for Children and Adolescents With Depression..

Original treatment assignment did not impact current functioning. Overall, participants' mood severity, executive functioning, and global functioning continued to be better than at RCT baseline. Depressive symptoms increased significantly from end of RCT. Manic symptom severity, executive functioning, and global functioning remained comparable to end of RCT. The majority of parents and youth reported improved youth emotion regulation skills and family communication. They considered study participation beneficial, with increased understanding of mood disorders being the top reason. Half of youth commenced or continued Ω3 and 58% commenced or continued psychotherapy post-RCT, suggesting some degree of consumer satisfaction; these youth had lower depression severity than other participants. LIMITATIONS: Only 40% returned to this naturalistic follow-up; they were less likely to have an African-American parent, were of higher income, and youth were more symptomatic at end of RCT than those who did not return CONCLUSIONS: Improvement from RCT baseline continued although depressive symptom severity increased from end of RCT to follow-up. Meaningful improvements in youth and family functioning persisted 2-5 years later.

Recently we showed that intraperitoneal administration of Pls improved cognitive function in experimental animals. In the present trial, we tested the efficacy of oral administration of scallop-derived purified Pls with respect to cognitive function and blood Pls changes in patients with mild AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: The study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 24weeks. Participants were 328 patients aged 60 to 85years who had 20 to 27 points in Mini Mental State Examination-Japanese (MMSE-J) score and five or less points in Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Version-Japanese (GDS-S-J). They were randomized to receive either 1mg/day of Pls purified from scallop or placebo. The patients and study physicians were masked to the assignment. The primary outcome was MMSE-J. The secondary outcomes included Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R), GDS-S-J and concentration of phosphatidyl ethanolamine plasmalogens (PlsPE) in erythrocyte membrane and plasma. This trial is registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network, number UMIN000014945. FINDINGS: Of 328 patients enrolled, 276 patients completed the trial (140 in the treatment group and 136 in the placebo group). In an intention-to-treat analysis including both mild AD (20≤MMSE-J≤23) and MCI (24≤MMSE-J≤27), no significant difference was shown between the treatment and placebo groups in the primary and secondary outcomes, with no severe adverse events in either group. In mild AD patients, WMS-R improved significantly in the treatment group, and the between group difference was nearly significant (P=0.067). In a subgroup analysis of mild AD patients, WMS-R significantly improved among females and those aged below 77years in the treatment group, and the between-group differences were statistically significant in females (P=0.017) and in those aged below 77years (P=0.029).

Evidence shows that various types of EOs have a wide range of health benefits. In our previous studies, the potential of lavender EO for prevention and even treatment of depression and anxiety symptoms was demonstrated. The favourable outcomes may be due to multiple mechanisms, including the regulation of monoamine level, the induction of neurotrophic factor expression, the regulation of the endocrine system and the promotion of neurogenesis. The molecules of EOs may reach the brain and exert an effect through two distinctive pathways, namely, the olfactory system and the respiratory system. After inhalation, the molecules of the EOs would either act directly on the olfactory mucosa or pass into the respiratory tract. These two delivery pathways suggest different underlying mechanisms of action. Different sets of responses would be triggered, such as increased neurogenesis, regulation of hormonal levels, activation of different brain regions, and alteration in blood biochemistry, which would ultimately affect both mood and emotion. In this review, we will discuss the clinical effects of EOs on mood regulation and emotional disturbances as well as the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action. Emphasis will be put on the interaction between the respiratory and central nervous system and the involved potential mechanisms. Further evidence is needed to support the use of EOs in the clinical treatment of mood disturbances. Exploration of the underlying mechanisms may provide insight into the future therapeutic use of EO components treatment of psychiatric and physical symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fung TKH ; Lau BWM ; Ngai SPC ; Tsang HWH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ijms22094844 ","Keywords":"Anxiety/*drug therapy/pathology\r\nBrain/diagnostic imaging/drug effects\r\nEmotions/drug effects\r\nHumans\r\nMood Disorders/*drug therapy/pathology\r\nNervous System/drug effects/pathology\r\nOils, Volatile/chemistry/*therapeutic use\r\nPlants/*chemistry\r\nRespiratory System/drug effects/pathology\r\nanti-depression\r\nanxiolytic\r\nessential oil\r\ninhalation therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fung TKH, Lau BWM, Ngai SPC, and Tsang HWH (2021) Therapeutic Effect and Mechanisms of Essential Oils in Mood Disorders: Interaction between the Nervous and Respiratory Systems..

Given the implication of certain nutrients in the onset of bipolar disorder, it has been hypothesized that nutraceuticals might be effective in improving symptoms of the condition (i.e. mania or depression). Our systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of adjunctive nutraceuticals compared to placebo. METHODS: We searched the following databases from inception to February 2019: Web of Science, CINAHL, Embase, and PsycINFO. We included only original randomized controlled trials written in English, testing the efficacy of nutraceuticals in add-on to standard care, compared to placebo, in patients with bipolar disorder. RESULTS: After identifying 6584 potentially relevant publications, we finally included 25 studies, among which six used fatty acids, seven micronutrients, seven amino acids. One study tested probiotics, while in four trials a combination of different types of nutraceuticals was used. Even if some compounds have shown promising results (i.e. fatty acids and N-acetyl cysteine for depression, amino acid drinks and folic acid for mania), the majority of nutraceuticals did not cause significant improvements in comparison to placebo. LIMITATIONS: We could not perform a meta-analysis due to the high heterogeneity of trials, which were also affected by some methodological caveats. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence regarding the efficacy of adjunctive nutraceuticals in bipolar disorder is inconsistent. Nevertheless, they appear generally free from relevant side effects. Well-designed trials are needed to further explore the potential role of nutraceuticals in different mood episodes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fusar-Poli L ; Surace T ; Vanella A ; Meo V ; Patania F ; Furnari R ; Signorelli MS ; Aguglia E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2019.04.039 ","Keywords":"Amino Acids/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/psychology/*therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMicronutrients/*therapeutic use\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nDepression\r\nFatty acids\r\nMania\r\nNutraceuticals\r\nSystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fusar-Poli L, Surace T, Vanella A, Meo V, Patania F, Furnari R, Signorelli MS, and Aguglia E (2019) The effect of adjunctive nutraceuticals in bipolar disorder: A systematic review of randomized placebo-controlled trials..

Therefore, nutritional approaches are potential strategies for the treatment of BD. The aim of this review is to summarize the available evidence on nutrition and BD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The paper was developed based on PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The search was conducted in Sep-2021 using PubMed and Cochrane Library, augmented by manually checked references lists. The search found 986 studies, of which 47 were included, combined with 13 from reference lists, totaling 60 studies. RESULTS: There were 33 observational trials, of which 15 focused on fatty acids, 9 on micronutrients, 5 on specific foods, 4 on macro and micronutrients. The 27 interventional studies mainly focused on fatty acids, micronutrients and N-acetylcysteine (NAC). DISCUSSION: Dietary intake or supplementation of unsaturated fatty acids, mainly Omega-3 seems to be associated with improved BD symptoms, along with seafood, folic acid and zinc. Studies found variable, mainly non-significant impacts of creatine, carnitine, vitamin D, inositol or NAC supplementation on BD. There are promising results associated with Coenzyme Q10 (Coq10) and probiotics. Taken together, these preliminary findings suggest that dietetic approaches might be included as part of BD treatment. Also considering the high risk of metabolic disorders in individuals with BD, they should be encouraged to choose healthy dietary lifestyles, including daily intake of fruits, vegetables, seafood and whole grains.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gabriel FC ; Oliveira M ; Martella BM ; Berk M ; Brietzke E ; Jacka FN ; Lafer B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/1028415X.2022.2077031 ","Keywords":"Nutritional psychiatry\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ndiet\r\nmental health\r\nmood\r\nneuroscience\r\npsychiatry\r\ntreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gabriel FC, Oliveira M, Martella BM, Berk M, Brietzke E, Jacka FN, and Lafer B (2022) Nutrition and bipolar disorder: a systematic review..

We examined effects of six weeks of fish oil supplementation on clinical characteristics in 16 patients with symptomatic major depressive disorder, and tested plasma phospholipid levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as correlates of clinical response. Depression symptoms improved after supplementation (p=0.007). The reduction in depression severity was not predicted by baseline PUFA levels but did exhibit a relationship with endpoint PUFAs, correlating negatively with DHA as a percentage of plasma phospholipids (DHA%; R(2)=0.60, p=0.004), adjusting for endpoint EPA%; and correlating positively with endpoint EPA% (R(2)=0.58, p=0.007), adjusting for endpoint DHA%. Thus, the higher the proportion of DHA to EPA, the greater the reduction in depression severity (r=-0.43, p=0.097). Five patients showed a decrease of >50% on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and a final score <7 and were thus not only responders but met standard criteria for remission, and were distinguished from non-responders by higher levels of DHA% (p=0.03). This pilot study suggests that post-supplementation DHA% levels may be a necessary target for antidepressant response to fish oil, and that this may depend to some extent on the efficacy of EPA conversion to DHA.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ganança L ; Galfalvy HC ; Oquendo MA ; Hezghia A ; Cooper TB ; Mann JJ ; Sublette ME ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.plefa.2017.03.004 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/blood/*diet therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/*blood\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/*blood\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/blood\r\nFemale\r\nFish Oils/*administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPilot Projects\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ganança L, Galfalvy HC, Oquendo MA, Hezghia A, Cooper TB, Mann JJ, and Sublette ME (2017) Lipid correlates of antidepressant response to omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation: A pilot study..

This umbrella review aimed to appraise the credibility of published evidence evaluating the associations between unsaturated fatty acids and mental disorders. In this umbrella review, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies comparing unsaturated fatty acids (including supplementation, dietary intake, and blood concentrations) in participants with mental disorders with healthy individuals were included. We reanalyzed summary estimates, between-study heterogeneity, predictive intervals, publication bias, small-study effects, and excess significance bias for each meta-analysis. Ninety-five meta-analyses from 29 systematic reviews were included, encompassing 43 studies on supplementation interventions, 32 studies on dietary factors, and 20 studies on blood biomarkers. Suggestive evidence was only observed for dietary intake, in which higher intake of fish was associated with reduced risk of depression (RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.89) and Alzheimer disease (RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.87), and higher intake of total PUFAs might be associated with a lower risk of mild cognitive impairment (RR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.84). Evidence showed that PUFA supplementation was favorable but had weak credibility in anxiety, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), dementia, mild cognitive impairment, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia (P-random effects <0.001-0.040). There was also weak evidence on the effect of decreased circulating n-3 (ɷ-3) PUFAs among patients on risk of ADHD, ASD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia (P-random effects <10-6-0.037). Our results suggest that higher levels of unsaturated fatty acids may relieve symptoms or reduce the risk of various mental disorders; however, the strength of the associations and credibility of the evidence were generally weak. Future high-quality research is needed to identify whether PUFA interventions should be prioritized to alleviate mental disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gao X ; Su X ; Han X ; Wen H ; Cheng C ; Zhang S ; Li W ; Cai J ; Zheng L ; Ma J ; Liao M ; Ni W ; Liu T ; Liu D ; Ma W ; Han S ; Zhu S ; Ye Y ; Zeng FF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/advances/nmac084 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nHumans\r\n*Alzheimer Disease\r\n*Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\r\n*Autism Spectrum Disorder\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated\r\nMeta-Analysis as Topic\r\nmental disorders\r\nmeta-analysis\r\nn–3 PUFA\r\numbrella review\r\nunsaturated fatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gao X, Su X, Han X, Wen H, Cheng C, Zhang S, Li W, Cai J, Zheng L, Ma J, Liao M, Ni W, Liu T, Liu D, Ma W, Han S, Zhu S, Ye Y, and Zeng FF (2022) Unsaturated Fatty Acids in Mental Disorders: An Umbrella Review of Meta-Analyses..

We hypothesized that combination therapy would lead not only to greater efficacy but also to a more rapid onset of therapeutic response. METHODS: Forty-two subjects participated in this 9-week randomized, masked, placebo-controlled study of combination therapy (two 1 g capsules containing a blend of 900 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid, 200 mg of and docosahexaenoic acid, and 100 mg of other omega-3 fatty acids twice daily plus citalopram) versus monotherapy (two 1 g capsules of olive oil per day plus citalopram) treatment of MDD. RESULTS: The combination therapy demonstrated significantly greater improvement in Hamilton Depression Rating scale scores over time (F = 7.32; df 1,177; P = 0.008) beginning at week 4 (t = -2.48; df 177; P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy was more effective than monotherapy in decreasing signs and symptoms of MDD during the 8 weeks of active treatment; however, combination therapy did not seem to enhance the speed of the initial antidepressant response.

METHOD: Fifty-four maintenance hemodialysis patients were randomized to ingest two omega-3 (each containing 180 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 120 mg docosahexaenoic acid) or placebo capsules, three times daily for 4 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score and serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, ferritin, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and ratios of IL-10 to IL-6 and IL-10 to TNF-α were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS: Omega-3 supplement lowered BDI score significantly after 4 months of intervention. Among pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, only serum ferritin level and IL-10 to IL-6 ratio showed significant changes in favor of omega-3 supplement during the study. In linear regression model adjusted for baseline values, omega-3 treatment was a significant predictor of reduced serum CRP, ferritin, and iPTH levels, and increased IL-10 to IL-6 ratio. No significant association was found between the anti-inflammatory and anti-depressant effects of omega-3 supplement. CONCLUSIONS: Supplemental use of omega-3 fatty acids decreases depressive symptoms in hemodialysis patients apart from their anti-inflammatory effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gharekhani A ; Khatami MR ; Dashti-Khavidaki S ; Razeghi E ; Noorbala AA ; Hashemi-Nazari SS ; Mansournia MA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00228-014-1666-1 ","Keywords":"Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nBiomarkers/blood\r\nC-Reactive Protein/analysis\r\nDepression/*prevention & control\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Combinations\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/adverse \r\n      effects/chemistry/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInterleukins/blood\r\nKidney Failure, Chronic/drug therapy/immunology/psychology/*therapy\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Renal Dialysis/psychology\r\nSingle-Blind Method\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nTumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/blood","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gharekhani A, Khatami MR, Dashti-Khavidaki S, Razeghi E, Noorbala AA, Hashemi-Nazari SS, and Mansournia MA (2014) The effect of omega-3 fatty acids on depressive symptoms and inflammatory markers in maintenance hemodialysis patients: a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial..

Despite the role of inflammation in those conditions, there is still a lack of effective anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) can reduce depressive symptoms and exert anti-inflammatory action putatively by the production of distinct n-3 PUFA-derived metabolites, such as resolvins D (RvD) and E (RvE) series, maresins (MaR) and protectins (PD), which are collectively named specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) and act as strong anti-inflammatory agents. In this review we summarize evidence showing the effects of treatment with those metabolites in pre-clinical models of psychiatric, neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. A total of 25 pre-clinical studies were identified using the PubMed database. Overall, RvD and RvE treatment improved depressive-like behaviors, whereas protectins and maresins ameliorated neurological function. On a cellular level, RvDs increased serotonin levels in a model of depression, and decreased gliosis in neurodegenerative disorders. Protectins prevented neurite and dendrite retraction and apoptosis in models of neurodegeneration, while maresins reduced cell death across all studies. In terms of mechanisms, all SPMs down-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines. Resolvins activated mTOR and MAP/ERK signaling in models of depression, while resolvins and maresins activated the NF-κB pathway in models of neurodegeneration and neurological disorders. Our review indicates a potential promising approach for tailored therapy with n-3 PUFAs-derived metabolites in the treatment of psychiatric, neurodegenerative, and neurological conditions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Giacobbe J ; Benoiton B ; Zunszain P ; Pariante CM ; Borsini A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00122 ","Keywords":"maresin\r\nneuroinflammation\r\nomega-3\r\npolyunsaturated fatty acid\r\nprotectin\r\nresolvin","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Giacobbe J, Benoiton B, Zunszain P, Pariante CM, and Borsini A (2020) The Anti-Inflammatory Role of Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Metabolites in Pre-Clinical Models of Psychiatric, Neurodegenerative, and Neurological Disorders..

Despite their widespread use, drugs used in the treatment of depression are only moderately more effective than placebo in treating the disorder.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) supplementation may reduce symptoms of major depressive disorder and perinatal depression. The aim of the present review was to evaluate epidemiological studies examining PUFA intake and depressive symptoms in the general population, as well as double-blind, placebo-controlled trials assessing the influence of n-3 PUFA in healthy individuals and those with depression; specific consideration was given to perinatal depression and potential gender differences in the relationship. Although there is some evidence to suggest that n-3 PUFA intake is associated with reduced depressive symptoms, particularly in females, these results are generally limited to epidemiological studies, whereas results from randomized controlled trials are mixed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Giles GE ; Mahoney CR ; Kanarek RB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/nure.12066 ","Keywords":"Affect/*drug effects\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nSex Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\ndepression\r\nomega‐3 fatty acids\r\nperinatal\r\npost‐partum","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Giles GE, Mahoney CR, and Kanarek RB (2013) Omega-3 fatty acids influence mood in healthy and depressed individuals..

Many clinical and epidemiologic studies have shown a positive role for n-3 in cardiovascular diseases, cancer, infant development and more recently, in various mental illnesses, especially in depression. These fatty acids are known to have pleiotropic effects, especially against hypertriglyceridemia and platelet aggregation. These may be mediated through several distinct mechanisms, including alterations in cell membrane composition and function, gene expression, or eicosanoid production. A number of authorities have recently recommended an increase in intakes of n-3 by the general population, because \"western\" diets are deficient in n-3 and have excessive amounts of n-6 fatty acids. The target EPA + DHA consumption was recommended to be at least 500 mg/day for individuals without heart disease and at least 800 to 1000 mg/day for patients with known coronary heart disease. To comply with this recommendation, a variety of food products, most notably eggs, yogurt, milk and spreads have been enriched with n-3. Additional controlled clinical trials are needed to document whether long-term consumption or supplementation with eicosapentaenoic (EPA) or docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids results in better quality of life (Fig. 4, Ref. 47).","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ginter E ; Simko V ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Animals\r\nCardiovascular Diseases/*prevention & control\r\nDepression/*prevention & control\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nImmunity/*drug effects\r\nNeoplasms/*prevention & control\r\nNutrition Policy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ginter E, and Simko V (2010) Polyunsaturated fatty acids n-3: new data on heart disease, cancer, immune resistance and mental depression..

Diet and its bioactive components have been recognized among the modifiable risk factors, possibly influencing their pathogenesis. This review aimed to summarize molecular mechanisms underlying the putative beneficial effects toward brain health of different dietary factors, such as micro- and macronutrient intake and habits, such as feeding time and circadian rhythm. The role of hormonal homeostasis in the context of glucose metabolism and adiponectin regulation and its impact on systemic and neuro-inflammation has also been considered and deepened. In addition, the effect of individual bioactive molecules exerting antioxidant activities and acting as anti-inflammatory agents, such as omega-3 fatty acids and polyphenols, considered beneficial for the central nervous system via modulation of adult neurogenesis, synaptic and neuronal plasticity, and microglia activation has been summarized. An overview of the regulation of the gut-brain axis and its effect on the modulation of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress has been provided. Finally, the impact of bioactive molecules on inflammation and oxidative stress and its association with brain health has been summarized.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Godos J ; Currenti W ; Angelino D ; Mena P ; Castellano S ; Caraci F ; Galvano F ; Del Rio D ; Ferri R ; Grosso G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/antiox9040346 ","Keywords":"brain\r\ndepression\r\ndiet\r\ninflammation\r\nmental health\r\nneuronal plasticity\r\nneurons\r\noxidative stress\r\npolyphenols\r\nsleep","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Godos J, Currenti W, Angelino D, Mena P, Castellano S, Caraci F, Galvano F, Del Rio D, Ferri R, and Grosso G (2020) Diet and Mental Health: Review of the Recent Updates on Molecular Mechanisms..

No single cause of PPD has been identified, however the increased risk of nutritional deficiencies incurred through the high nutritional requirements of pregnancy may play a role in the pathology of depressive symptoms. Three nutritional interventions have drawn particular interest as possible non-invasive and cost-effective prevention and/or treatment strategies for PPD; omega-3 (n-3) long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), vitamin D and overall diet. METHODS: We searched for meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCT's) of nutritional interventions during the perinatal period with PPD as an outcome, and checked for any trials published subsequently to the meta-analyses. RESULTS: Fish oil: Eleven RCT's of prenatal fish oil supplementation RCT's show null and positive effects on PPD symptoms. Vitamin D: no relevant RCT's were identified, however seven observational studies of maternal vitamin D levels with PPD outcomes showed inconsistent associations. Diet: Two Australian RCT's with dietary advice interventions in pregnancy had a positive and null result on PPD. LIMITATIONS: With the exception of fish oil, few RCT's with nutritional interventions during pregnancy assess PPD. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to determine whether nutritional intervention strategies during pregnancy can protect against symptoms of PPD. Given the prevalence of PPD and ease of administering PPD measures, we recommend future prenatal nutritional RCT's include PPD as an outcome.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gould JF ; Best K ; Makrides M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2016.12.014 ","Keywords":"Depression, Postpartum/*prevention & control\r\nDiet/statistics & numerical data\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMicronutrients\r\n*Nutritional Status\r\nPostpartum Period/psychology\r\nPregnancy\r\nPrenatal Care/*methods\r\n*Prenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nDepression\r\nDiet\r\nIntervention\r\nNutrition\r\nPostpartum","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gould JF, Best K, and Makrides M (2017) Perinatal nutrition interventions and post-partum depressive symptoms..

METHODS: Children and adolescents aged 6-17 years with symptomatic bipolar I or bipolar II disorder (n = 51), manic, hypomanic, mixed, or depressed, were randomized to either flax oil capsules containing 550 mg alpha-LNA per 1 gram or an olive oil placebo adjunctively or as monotherapy. Doses were titrated to 12 capsules per day as tolerated over 16 weeks. Primary outcomes included changes in the Young Mania Rating Scale, Child Depression Rating Scale-Revised, and Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar ratings using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in primary outcome measures when compared by treatment assignment. However, clinician-rated Global Symptom Severity was negatively correlated with final serum omega-3 fatty acid compositions: %alpha-LNA (r = -0.45, p < 0.007), % eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (r = -0.47, p < 0.005); and positively correlated with final arachidonic acid (AA) (r = 0.36, p < 0.05) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) n-6 (r = 0.48, p < 0.004). The mean duration of treatment for alpha-LNA was 11.8 weeks versus 8 weeks for placebo; however, the longer treatment duration for alpha-LNA was not significant after controlling for baseline variables. Subjects discontinued the study for continued depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Studies of essential fatty acid supplementation are feasible and well tolerated in the pediatric population. Although flax oil may decrease severity of illness in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder who have meaningful increases in serum EPA percent levels and/or decreased AA and DPA n-6 levels, individual variations in conversion of alpha-LNA to EPA and docosahexaenoic acid as well as dosing burden favor the use of fish oil both for clinical trials and clinical practice. Additionally, future research should focus on adherence and analysis of outcome based on changes in essential fatty acid tissue compositions, as opposed to group randomization alone.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gracious BL ; Chirieac MC ; Costescu S ; Finucane TL ; Youngstrom EA ; Hibbeln JR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1399-5618.2010.00799.x ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nArachidonic Acid/blood\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nChild\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/blood\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/blood\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/blood\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLinseed Oil/adverse effects/*metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nalpha-Linolenic Acid/adverse effects/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gracious BL, Chirieac MC, Costescu S, Finucane TL, Youngstrom EA, and Hibbeln JR (2010) Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of flax oil in pediatric bipolar disorder..

Subsequent research has revealed many beneficial effects of the omega-3 PUFAs in particular. This has been linked to their involvement in multiple biochemical functions, including synthesis of inflammatory mediators, cell membrane fluidity, intracellular signalling and gene expression. Through these pathways, the omega-3 PUFAs help modulate aspects of inflammation and immunity, cell growth and tissue repair. While a detailed understanding of the mechanisms involved in the role of omega-3 PUFAs to health in the central nervous system (CNS) is still to be elucidated, a role for both inflammatory modulation and a direct impact on neuronal membrane fluidity and receptor function is apparent. At least partially through these mechanisms, low omega-3 levels have been associated with CNS-linked disorders such as poor cognition, depression, anxiety disorders, poor anger control, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and accelerated neurodegeneration in the elderly.Following a brief introduction to the history and chemistry of the omega-3 family of PUFAs, this chapter will provide an overview of the omega-3 fatty acids and how various members of this PUFA family influence central nervous system function leading towards either health or disease.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Grant R ; Guest J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-28383-8_13 ","Keywords":"Fatty Acids, Omega-3/*deficiency/*metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nNervous System Diseases/*physiopathology\r\n*Nervous System Physiological Phenomena\r\nCNS\r\nDementia\r\nDepression\r\nInflammation\r\nNeurodegenerative\r\nOmega-3","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Grant R, and Guest J (2016) Role of Omega-3 PUFAs in Neurobiological Health..

We examined behaviour and neurobiology in a model of T2D, testing for benefits with dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). METHODS: Male C57Bl/6 mice received vehicle or 75 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) and 21 wks of control or Western diets (43 % fat, 40 % carbohydrate, 17 % protein). Sub-sets received dietary α-linolenic acid (ALA; 10 % of fat intake) for 6 wks. Behaviour was examined via open field and sucrose preference tests, and hippocampal and frontal cortex (FC) leptin and dopamine levels and inflammatory signalling assessed. KEY FINDINGS: T2D mice exhibited weight gain (+15 %), hyperglycemia (+35 %), hyperinsulinemia (+60 %) and insulin-resistance (+80 % higher HOMA-IR), together with anxiety-like behaviour (without anhedonia) that appeared independent of body weight and glycemic status. Cortical leptin declined whereas receptor mRNA increased. Supplementation with ALA did not influence metabolic state, while enhancing locomotion and reducing anxiety-like behaviours in healthy but not T2D mice. Hippocampal dopamine was selectively increased by ALA in T2D mice, with a trend to reduced circulating leptin in both groups. Across all groups, anxiety-like behaviour was associated with declining cortical and hippocampal leptin levels and increasing receptor mRNA, while declining dopamine levels were accompanied by decreased dopamine/serotonin receptor transcripts. SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic T2D induced anxiogenesis in mice appears to be independent of metabolic homeostasis but linked to central leptin-resistance, together with disturbed dopamine and serotonin signalling. Despite anxiolytic effects of ALA in healthy mice, no metabolic or behavioural benefits were evident in T2D.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Griffith TA ; Russell JS ; Naghipour S ; Helman TJ ; Peart JN ; Stapelberg NJC ; Headrick JP ; Du Toit EF; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.lfs.2022.121137 ","Keywords":"Male\r\nMice\r\nAnimals\r\nalpha-Linolenic Acid/pharmacology\r\nLeptin\r\n*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2\r\n*Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental\r\nNeurobiology\r\nDopamine\r\nFatty Acids\r\nDiet, Western\r\nRNA, Messenger\r\nAnxiety\r\nDepression\r\nDiabetes\r\nDopamine\r\nLeptin\r\nLocomotion\r\nOmega 3 fatty acids\r\nSerotonin","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Griffith TA, Russell JS, Naghipour S, Helman TJ, Peart JN, Stapelberg NJC, Headrick JP, and Du Toit EF (2022) Behavioural disruption in diabetic mice: Neurobiological correlates and influences of dietary α-linolenic acid..

Several epidemiological studies reported a significant inverse correlation between intake of oily fish and depression or bipolar disorders. Studies conducted specifically on the association between omega-3 intake and depression reported contrasting results, suggesting that the preventive role of omega-3 PUFA may depend also on other factors, such as overall diet quality and the social environment. Accordingly, tertiary prevention with omega-3 PUFA supplement in depressed patients has reached greater effectiveness during the last recent years, although definitive statements on their use in depression therapy cannot be yet freely asserted. Among the biological properties of omega-3 PUFA, their anti-inflammatory effects and their important role on the structural changing of the brain should be taken into account to better understand the possible pathway through which they can be effective both in preventing or treating depression. However, the problem of how to correct the inadequate supply of omega-3 PUFA in the Westernized countries' diet is a priority in order to set food and health policies and also dietary recommendations for individuals and population groups.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Grosso G ; Galvano F ; Marventano S ; Malaguarnera M ; Bucolo C ; Drago F ; Caraci F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1155/2014/313570 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nDiet\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/biosynthesis/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Grosso G, Galvano F, Marventano S, Malaguarnera M, Bucolo C, Drago F, and Caraci F (2014) Omega-3 fatty acids and depression: scientific evidence and biological mechanisms..

OBJECTIVES: To conduct an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of omega-3 PUFA treatment of depressive disorders, taking into account the clinical differences among patients included in the studies. METHODS: A search on MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Database of RCTs using omega-3 PUFA on patients with depressive symptoms published up to August 2013 was performed. Standardized mean difference in clinical measure of depression severity was primary outcome. Type of omega-3 used (particularly eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) and omega-3 as mono- or adjuvant therapy was also examined. Meta-regression analyses assessed the effects of study size, baseline depression severity, trial duration, dose of omega-3, and age of patients. RESULTS: Meta-analysis of 11 and 8 trials conducted respectively on patients with a DSM-defined diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) and patients with depressive symptomatology but no diagnosis of MDD demonstrated significant clinical benefit of omega-3 PUFA treatment compared to placebo (standardized difference in random-effects model 0.56 SD [95% CI: 0.20, 0.92] and 0.22 SD [95% CI: 0.01, 0.43], respectively; pooled analysis was 0.38 SD [95% CI: 0.18, 0.59]). Use of mainly EPA within the preparation, rather than DHA, influenced final clinical efficacy. Significant clinical efficacy had the use of omega-3 PUFA as adjuvant rather than mono-therapy. No relation between efficacy and study size, baseline depression severity, trial duration, age of patients, and study quality was found. Omega-3 PUFA resulted effective in RCTs on patients with bipolar disorder, whereas no evidence was found for those exploring their efficacy on depressive symptoms in young populations, perinatal depression, primary disease other than depression and healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The use of omega-3 PUFA is effective in patients with diagnosis of MDD and on depressive patients without diagnosis of MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Grosso G ; Pajak A ; Marventano S ; Castellano S ; Galvano F ; Bucolo C ; Drago F ; Caraci F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0096905 ","Keywords":"Depressive Disorder/*diet therapy/*metabolism/pathology\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/therapeutic use\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/*therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMEDLINE\r\nPregnancy\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Grosso G, Pajak A, Marventano S, Castellano S, Galvano F, Bucolo C, Drago F, and Caraci F (2014) Role of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of depressive disorders: a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials..

We aimed to systematically review and perform meta-analysis of results from observational studies exploring the association between fish, n-3 PUFA dietary intake, and depression. METHODS: A search on the main bibliographic source of the observational studies up to August 2015 was performed. Random-effects models of the highest versus the lowest (reference) category of exposure and dose-response meta-analysis were performed. RESULTS: A total of 31 studies including 255,076 individuals and over 20,000 cases of depression, were examined. Analysis of 21 datasets investigating relation between fish consumption and depression resulted in significant reduced risk (RR=0.78, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.89), with a linear dose-response despite with moderate heterogeneity. Pooled risk estimates of depression for extreme categories of both total n-3 PUFA and fish-derived n-3 PUFA [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)+docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] resulted in decreased risk for the highest compared with the lowest intake (RR=0.78, 95% CI: 0.67, 0.92 and RR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.92, respectively) and dose-response analysis revealed a J-shaped association with a peak decreased risk for 1.8g/d intake of n-3 PUFA (RR=0.30, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.98). LIMITATION: Design of the studies included and confounding due to lack adjustment for certain variables may exist. CONCLUSIONS: The present analysis supports the hypothesis that dietary n-3 PUFA intake are associated with lower risk of depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Grosso G ; Micek A ; Marventano S ; Castellano S ; Mistretta A ; Pajak A ; Galvano F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2016.08.011 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nDepressive Disorder/*epidemiology/prevention & control\r\n*Diet\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage\r\n*Fishes\r\nHumans\r\nObservational Studies as Topic\r\nPrevalence\r\nRisk\r\n*Cross-sectional\r\n*Depression\r\n*Fish\r\n*Meta-analysis\r\n*N-3 PUFA\r\n*Prospective","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Grosso G, Micek A, Marventano S, Castellano S, Mistretta A, Pajak A, and Galvano F (2016) Dietary n-3 PUFA, fish consumption and depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies..

Cognitive impairment and depression lead to comorbidities, such as metabolic syndrome, in elderly people. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of dietary n-3 PUFAs on cognition and depressive-like behavior in an accelerated senescence rat model with prediabetic status. Rats were cotreated with d-gal and sucrose solution for 7 months and then fed fish-oil- or flaxseed-oil-rich diets for 3 months. Cognitive impairment analysis and depressive-like behavioral testing were conducted using the Morris water maze (MWM) test and forced swimming test (FST), respectively. The MWM test results revealed that the d-gal + sucrose + flaxseed oil (DSFS) group had a significantly shorter mean latency time in the short-term spatial memory trial on day 2 than did the d-gal + sucrose + fish oil (DSFO) group. The FST results demonstrated that the DSFO group exhibited a significantly shorter immobility time and longer climbing time than did the control group. Western blot analysis of the receptor for advanced glycation end-product (RAGE) level identified a significant difference in the DSFO group compared with the control group. Significantly lower n-6/n-3 PUFA ratios were observed in the frontal cortices of the DSFO and DSFS groups. In conclusion, fish and flaxseed oils exerted a protective effect on cognitive impairment and decreased the incidence of depressive-like behavior in d-gal- and sucrose-fed prediabetic aging rats. n-3 PUFA-rich oil diets, particularly the fish oil diet, reduced the plasma levels of nonesterified fatty acids, tumor necrosis factor-α, and brain dopamine and RAGE expression but not glycemic status, resulting in an improvement in the time of escape latency and the time spent in the target quadrant in the MWM test.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Guo YR ; Lee HC ; Lo YC ; Yu SC ; Huang SY ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1039/C8FO00074C ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrain/drug effects/metabolism\r\nCognition/drug effects\r\nCognition Disorders/blood/etiology/*prevention & control/psychology\r\nDopamine/blood\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage/analysis\r\nFish Oils/administration & dosage/analysis\r\nGalactose/adverse effects\r\nHumans\r\nLinseed Oil/administration & dosage/analysis\r\nMale\r\nPrediabetic State/blood/*complications/etiology/psychology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nReceptor for Advanced Glycation End Products/blood/genetics\r\nTumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/blood/genetics","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Guo YR, Lee HC, Lo YC, Yu SC, and Huang SY (2018) n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids prevent d-galactose-induced cognitive deficits in prediabetic rats..

The antidepressant effects of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been widely reported. The subcommittee of the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research organized an expert panel and conducted a literature review and a Delphi process to develop a consensus-based practice guideline for clinical use of n-3 PUFAs in MDD. The guideline focuses on 5 thematic areas: general concepts, acute treatment strategy, depression recurrence monitoring and prevention, use in special populations, and potential safety issues. The key practice guidelines contend that: (1) clinicians and other practitioners are advised to conduct a clinical interview to validate clinical diagnoses, physical conditions, and measurement-based psychopathological assessments in the therapeutic settings when recommending n-3 PUFAs in depression treatment; (2) with respect to formulation and dosage, both pure eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or an EPA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) combination of a ratio higher than 2 (EPA/DHA >2) are considered effective, and the recommended dosages should be 1-2 g of net EPA daily, from either pure EPA or an EPA/DHA (>2:1) formula; (3) the quality of n-3 PUFAs may affect therapeutic activity; and (4) potential adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal and dermatological conditions, should be monitored, as well as obtaining comprehensive metabolic panels. The expert consensus panel has agreed on using n-3 PUFAs in MDD treatment for pregnant women, children, and the elderly, and prevention in high-risk populations. Personalizing the clinical application of n-3 PUFAs in subgroups of MDD with a low Omega-3 Index or high levels of inflammatory markers might be regarded as areas that deserve future research.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Guu TW ; Mischoulon D ; Sarris J ; Hibbeln J ; McNamara RK ; Hamazaki K ; Freeman MP ; Maes M ; Matsuoka YJ ; Belmaker RH ; Jacka F ; Pariante C ; Berk M ; Marx W ; Su KP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000502652 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBiomarkers\r\nChild\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/prevention & control\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/*therapeutic use\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/*therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*blood\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nPregnancy\r\nSocieties, Medical\r\nDocosahexaenoic acid\r\nEicosapentaenoic acid\r\nGuideline\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nOmega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Guu TW, Mischoulon D, Sarris J, Hibbeln J, McNamara RK, Hamazaki K, Freeman MP, Maes M, Matsuoka YJ, Belmaker RH, Jacka F, Pariante C, Berk M, Marx W, and Su KP (2019) International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research Practice Guidelines for Omega-3 Fatty Acids in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder..

In 2019, the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research (ISNPR) developed the first practice guidelines for n-3 PUFA treatment of MDD. To strengthen these guidelines and enhance their clinical applicability, we synthesized the evidence and clinical experiences previously obtained through the Delphi methodology. METHODS: Nineteen statements covering five major domains in MDD treatment were formulated through internal meetings. Fourteen international experts were invited to participate in the web-based Delphi process that validated the statements. Likert scales were used, and consensus level was set at 7.0/10.0, with the equivocal level set at 5.1-6.9. The items with scores < 5.0 were allocated into a second round Delphi survey with inverse questions. RESULTS: All panelists completed the survey. Sixteen statements reached consensus, and the statement \"n-3 PUFAs are one of the potential adjunctive treatments for adult MDD\" reached the highest agreement. \"N-3 PUFAs are one of the potential monotherapies for adult MDD\" instead scored lowest. Regarding \"special populations,\" many items, reached high consensus despite sub-optimal supportive evidence. LIMITATION: The panelists had a specialized interest in n-3 PUFAs; focus was placed on clinical issues rather than on biological mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: The Delphi process helps bridge the gap between scientific evidence and clinical practice, supports certain uses of PUFA and identifies insufficiency in current evidence that merit future research.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Guu TW ; Mischoulon D ; Sarris J ; Hibbeln J ; McNamara RK ; Hamazaki K ; Freeman MP ; Maes M ; Matsuoka YJ ; Belmaker RH ; Marx W ; Pariante C ; Berk M ; Jacka F ; Su KP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2020.01.050 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nConsensus\r\nDelphi Technique\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated\r\nHumans\r\nDHA\r\nDelphi\r\nEPA\r\nguideline\r\nmajor depressive disorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Guu TW, Mischoulon D, Sarris J, Hibbeln J, McNamara RK, Hamazaki K, Freeman MP, Maes M, Matsuoka YJ, Belmaker RH, Marx W, Pariante C, Berk M, Jacka F, and Su KP (2020) A multi-national, multi-disciplinary Delphi consensus study on using omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) for the treatment of major depressive disorder..

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC/MS. Identification of major compounds was also carried out by comparison with authentic samples. The psychopharmacological profile of L. glaucescens essential oil, and some its major compounds, were evaluated in mice using several experimental models: forced swimming test (FST: Antidepressant-like activity), open field test (OFT: Spontaneous locomotor activity), elevated plus-maze (EPM: Anxiolytic-like activity), exploratory cylinder (ECT: Sedative-like activity), rotarod (motor coordination) and traction performance (myo-relaxant effect) the essential oil and active principles was administered intraperitoneally. RESULTS: The essential oil showed antidepressant-like activity at doses of 100 and 300 mg/Kg. The monoterpenes β-pinene and linalool were identified as the two main active principles of the essential oil, and showed antidepressant-like and sedative-like activity. Eucalyptol, limonene and α-pinene they did not show antidepressant-like activity, and were not further tested.

METHODS: Fifty two patients with AMI were enrolled into the study and randomized to the study group (group P; n=26; standard therapy+n-3 PUFA 1 g daily) or the control group (group C; n=26; standard therapy). The following psychological tests were used at the baseline (3rd day of AMI) and after one month (30±1 days): Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory in a specific situation (STAI-S) and as a general trait (STAI-T), Emotional State Questionnaire (ESQ). RESULTS: The baseline characteristics, pharmacotherapy and BDI, STAI-S/T and ESQ were similar between both groups. The mean test scores assessed for all patients (group P and C) during the one-month observation were significantly lower for BDI (p=0.04), STAI-T (p=0.03), STAI-S (p=0.01) and harm/loss emotions (p=0.005). After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, coronary artery disease severity, ejection fraction, serum troponin level and the baseline tests results, n-3 PUFA intervention revealed additional significant decrease in BDI (p=0.046), STAI-S (p=0.03) and harm/loss emotions (p=0.04).

Depressive disorders cause the highest burden of disease in this age group across all medical conditions. Treatment adherence is usually very poor, and the use of antidepressant drugs is heavily debated, as suicidal ideations may increase, in particular in the early phase of treatment. Omega-3 fatty acids rich in eicosapentaenoic acid have shown some promising results in over a dozen small scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adult major depressive disorders, with only very few published RCTs in children and adolescents. High-quality phase III RCTs are missing. Methods and Design: The omega-3-pMDD trial is a carefully designed phase III RCT to assess the efficacy and safety of omega-3 fatty acids in the early course of pediatric major depressive disorder (MDD). The study is designed as a multi-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial enrolling 220 patients aged 8 to 17 years meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder of at least moderate symptom severity. After a single-blinded placebo-lead-in phase (7 to 10 days) patients are randomly assigned to omega-3 fatty acids or placebo over 36 weeks. Primary outcomes are changes in depression severity, as well as remission and recovery rates. Secondary outcome measures include the omega-3 index and inflammatory parameters as predictors of response. Data analysis will be performed in the intention-to-treat sample using a (generalized) linear random intercept regression model. Through sampling of blood, hair, saliva, and urine, further putative biological markers for depression and omega-3 fatty response will be investigated. Discussion: This trial addresses if omega-3 fatty acids play a role in the pathogenesis of pediatric MDDs and have antidepressant properties, in particular in clinically depressed children and adolescents with a pre-existing omega-3 fatty acid deficiency, increased markers of oxidative stress, and/or markers of (low grade) inflammation. Ethics and Dissemination: The study was approved by the local ethics committees. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals irrespective of specific outcomes.

The odds for experiencing depressive symptoms in diabetic patients are two times more than nondiabetic persons, and depression is an independent predictor for the onset of diabetes. However, depression has been approximately unrecognized and untreated in two-thirds of diabetic patients, which may lead to worsened diabetes complications. A cornerstone strategy for managing depression among diabetic patients is the use of diet to improve both health problems. Because of similar pathophysiology for chronic diseases and depression, it seems that similar dietary recommendations could be useful. However, few studies have been conducted among diabetic patients. Regarding the complications of diabetes such as renal diseases and coronary heart diseases, the proper range of various macronutrients should be clarified in depressed diabetic patients as well as the proper type of each macronutrient.

Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that deficits in the dietary PUFA docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid are associated with the onset and progression of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as dementia, schizophrenia, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recent clinical trials have offered compelling evidence that suggests that n-3 PUFA could reduce depressive, psychotic, and suicidal symptoms, as well as aggression. Although many studies have had the validity of their results questioned because of small sample size, several studies have indicated that n-3 PUFA are useful therapeutic tools for the treatment of dementia, major depression, bipolar disorder, and PTSD. These findings suggest that the pharmacological and nutritional actions of n-3 PUFA may be beneficial in certain neuropsychiatric illnesses.

METHODS: Participants in elderly care facilities and nursing homes (n = 75; 88.5 ± 0.6 years) were randomized in active and placebo groups. The active group had family-style meals containing an additional 1720 mg of docosahexaenoic acid per day for 12 months. At baseline, and after 6 and 12 months of intervention, cognitive function was assessed using Hasegawa's Dementia Scale-Revised and the Mini-Mental State Examination; mental health condition was assessed with the Apathy scale and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale; caregiver burden was evaluated using Zarit Burden Interview scores; and participants' serum biochemical factors were measured. RESULTS: The participants were suggested to have dementia. After 12 months, the mean change in Mini-Mental State Examination subitem \"Registration\" score from baseline to month 12 showed a tendency to be greater in the active group than that in the placebo group. Mean changes in the Apathy scale from baseline to month 12 were less, and the changes in the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and the total Zarit Burden Interview scores showed a tendency to be lower in the active group than in the placebo group, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that docosahexaenoic acid-enriched meals protect against age-related cognitive decline, and also improve apathy and caregiver burden for the oldest-elderly Japanese with cognitive impairment, such as dementia.

At baseline and after 12 months of treatment, mental health condition was assessed using the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Apathy Scale, and serum biochemical parameters were determined. From baseline to 12 months of intervention, both SDS depression and apathy scores improved significantly in the PO-administered group. Compared to those of control group, serum norepinephrine and serotonin levels after 12 months decreased in the PO-administered group. The enhanced mental state observed in PO-subjects was accompanied by LNA level increases in erythrocyte plasma membranes. Our data demonstrate that PO intake enhances blood LNA levels and may maintain healthy mental conditions in adult subjects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hashimoto M ; Matsuzaki K ; Kato S ; Hossain S ; Ohno M ; Shido O ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/foods9040530 ","Keywords":"apathy\r\ndepression\r\nmental health\r\nperilla oil\r\nα-linolenic acid\r\nω-polyunsaturated fatty acid","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hashimoto M, Matsuzaki K, Kato S, Hossain S, Ohno M, and Shido O (2020) Twelve-month Studies on Perilla Oil Intake in Japanese Adults-Possible Supplement for Mental Health..

METHODS: Electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBase, and Web of Science, were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of fish oil versus placebo or no treatment in MHD patients. The study selection and data extraction were conducted independently by two reviewers, and statistical analysis was performed using RevMan software, version 5.2. RESULTS: A total of thirteen eligible RCTs involving 916 subjects (461 in the experimental group and 455 in the control group) were included. The meta-analysis showed that fish oil significantly reduced arteriovenous graft (AV-graft) events [risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95 % confidence interval (CI) were (0.52, 0.97)] and cardiovascular events [RR (95 %CI) were 0.41 (0.26, 0.66)] in the fish oil group. In addition, compared with the control group, fish oil significantly decreased the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score [weighted mean difference (WMD) (95 %CI) were -11.91 (-15.88, -7.95)], serum intact parathyroidism (iPTH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and triglycerides (TG) [standard mean difference (SMD) (95 %CI) were -0.56 (-0.89, -0.23); -0.36 (-0.63, -0.09), and -0.41 (-0.68, -0.14), respectively]. However, the fish oil group did not differ significantly from the control group in albumin (ALB), hemoglobin (Hb), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Fish oil reduced the risk of AV-graft events and cardiovascular events, and alleviated depression symptoms in MHD patients. It can also improve secondary hyperparathyroidism, micro-inflammation, and hypertriglyceridemia. But there is no evidence that fish oil can improve nutritional status and renal anemia.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"He L ; Li MS ; Lin M ; Zhao TY ; Gao P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00228-015-1976-y ","Keywords":"*Dietary Supplements\r\nFish Oils/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\n*Renal Dialysis\r\nFish oil\r\nMaintenance hemodialysis\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nRandomized controlled trial","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"He L, Li MS, Lin M, Zhao TY, and Gao P (2016) Effect of fish oil supplement in maintenance hemodialysis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials..

Early study demonstrated that musk, glandular secretion from male musk deer, exerted an antidepressant-like effect. The aim of this study was to investigate if muscone, a bioactive ingredient in musk, could ameliorate neuroinflammation and depressive-like behaviors as well as explore the potential action mechanism. Mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with muscone for 2 weeks prior to administration of lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 1 mg/kg, i.p.). Pre-treatment with muscone reversed the LPS-induced decrease in body weight within 24 h and ameliorated depressive-like behaviors shown by sucrose preference, tail suspension test, and forced swimming test. LPS-induced activation of microglial cells and elevation in expression of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, RANTES, and MCP-1 in the prefrontal cortex of mice were effectively abrogated by muscone, which significantly down-regulated expression of TLR4, MyD88, Caspase-1, NLRP3, renin, and Ang II. In addition, treatment of BV2 microglia cells with muscone markedly attenuated the LPS-induced rise in protein expression of TLR4, Ang II, and IL-1β. This study revealed that muscone could ameliorate LPS-induced depressive-like behaviors by repressing neuroinflammation in the prefrontal cortex of mice caused by its suppression on microglia activation and production of inflammatory cytokines via acting on TLR4 pathway and RAS cascade.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"He MC ; Shi Z ; Qin M ; Sha NN ; Li Y ; Liao DF ; Lin FH ; Shu B ; Sun YL ; Yuan TF ; Wang YJ ; Zhang Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1142/S0192415X20500287 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBody Weight/drug effects\r\nCycloparaffins/*administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nCytokines/metabolism\r\nDeer\r\nDepression/chemically induced/*drug therapy\r\nInflammation Mediators/metabolism\r\nInjections, Intraperitoneal\r\nLipopolysaccharides/*adverse effects\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMicroglia/cytology/drug effects\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/metabolism/pathology\r\nSignal Transduction/drug effects\r\nToll-Like Receptor 4/metabolism\r\nDepression\r\nMicroglia\r\nMuscone\r\nNeuroinflammation\r\nRenin-Angiotensin System","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"He MC, Shi Z, Qin M, Sha NN, Li Y, Liao DF, Lin FH, Shu B, Sun YL, Yuan TF, Wang YJ, and Zhang Y (2020) Muscone Ameliorates LPS-Induced Depressive-Like Behaviors and Inhibits Neuroinflammation in Prefrontal Cortex of Mice..

The etiology of these diseases is multifactorial, involving genetic and environmental factors. Evidence suggests that inadequate levels of n-3 (omega- 3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the brain may represent a risk factor for these disorders. These fatty acids, which are derived from the diet, are a major component of neuronal membranes and are of particular importance in brain development and function. Low levels of n-3 PUFAs in the brain affect the brain dopamine systems and, when combined with appropriate genetic and other factors, increase the risk of developing these disorders and/or the severity of the disease. This article reviews the neurobiology of n-3 PUFAs and their effects on dopaminergic function. CONCLUSION: Clinical studies supporting their role in the etiologies of diseases involving the brain dopamine systems and the potential of n-3 PUFAs in the treatment of these disorders are discussed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Healy-Stoffel M ; Levant B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1871527317666180412153612 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrain/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nDopamine/*metabolism\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/*etiology/*therapy\r\nDopamine\r\nParkinson's disease\r\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder\r\ndepression\r\nomega-3; docosahexaenoic acid\r\nschizophrenia.","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Healy-Stoffel M, and Levant B (2018) N-3 (Omega-3) Fatty Acids: Effects on Brain Dopamine Systems and Potential Role in the Etiology and Treatment of Neuropsychiatric Disorders..

RECENT FINDINGS: Numerous studies have documented low omega-3 fatty acid levels in those with depressive disorders, and there are plausible biological explanations as to why reduced omega-3 status may predispose to mood disorders as well as to a range of other conditions. Although early studies evaluating the role of omega-3 preparations as treatments of depression were generally positive, the rate of negative or nondifferential studies has increased in recent years. Recent meta-analyses provide an explanation in suggesting that docosahexaenoic acid-weighted preparations may be ineffective while finding support for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-weighted preparations. SUMMARY: There is sufficient indicative data favouring EPA-weighted omega-3 supplementation for those with a depressive mood disorder, particular when fish oil is viewed by patients as 'natural,' it has few side effects and is neuroprotective. Recent meta-analyses inform us that intervention studies should focus on EPA-weighted preparations.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hegarty B ; Parker G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/YCO.0b013e32835ab4a7 ","Keywords":"Dietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/therapeutic use\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-6/metabolism\r\nFish Oils/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMood Disorders/metabolism/*therapy\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hegarty B, and Parker G (2013) Fish oil as a management component for mood disorders - an evolving signal..

Altered omega-3 fatty acid status has been implicated in reduced resistance to stress and mood disorders. We therefore evaluated the effects of repeated restraint stress (6 h/day for 21 days) on adult rats fed omega-3 deficient, control or omega-3 enriched diets from conception. We measured body weight, plasma corticosterone and hippocampus glucocorticoid receptors and correlated these data with emotional and depression-like behaviour assessed by their open-field (OF) activity, anxiety in the elevated-plus maze (EPM), the sucrose preference test and the startle response. We also determined their plasma and brain membrane lipid profiles by gas chromatography. Repeated restraint stress caused rats fed a control diet to lose weight. Their plasma corticosterone increased and they showed moderate behavioural changes, with increases only in grooming (OF test) and entries into the open arms (EPM). Rats fed the omega-3 enriched diet had a lower stress-induced weight loss and plasma corticosterone peak, and reduced grooming. Rats chronically lacking omega-3 fatty acid exhibited an increased startle response, a stress-induced decrease in locomotor activity and exaggerated grooming. The brain omega-3 fatty acids increased as the dietary omega-3 fatty acids increased; diets containing preformed long-chain omega-3 fatty acid were better than diets containing the precursor alpha-linolenic acid. However, the restraint stress reduced the amounts of omega-3 incorporated. These data showed that the response to chronic restraint stress was modulated by the omega-3 fatty acid supply, a dietary deficiency was deleterious while enrichment protecting against stress.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hennebelle M ; Balasse L ; Latour A ; Champeil-Potokar G ; Denis S ; Lavialle M ; Gisquet-Verrier P ; Denis I ; Vancassel S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0042142 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nBody Weight\r\nChromatography, Gas\r\nCorticosterone/blood\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nHippocampus/metabolism\r\n*Immobilization\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nReceptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism\r\n*Stress, Physiological","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hennebelle M, Balasse L, Latour A, Champeil-Potokar G, Denis S, Lavialle M, Gisquet-Verrier P, Denis I, and Vancassel S (2012) Influence of omega-3 fatty acid status on the way rats adapt to chronic restraint stress..

Here we assess nutrients in military diets, specifically highly unsaturated essential fatty acids, in the reduction of risk or treatment of psychiatric distress. Moderate to strong evidence from several meta-analyses of prospective cohort trials indicate that Mediterranean diet patterns reduce risk of clinical depressions. Specific nutrients and foods of biological interest in relation to mental health outcomes are then discussed and evaluated. Moderate evidence indicates that when fish consumption decreases and simultaneously omega-6 increases, the risk of clinical depressive symptoms are elevated. One meta-analysis examining tissue compositions provides moderate to strong evidence that higher levels of omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) (eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid) are associated with decreased risk of clinical depressions. Other meta-analytic reviews of randomized placebo-controlled trials provide moderate to strong evidence of significantly improving clinically depressive symptoms when the formulation given was >50% in eicosapentaenoic acid. Finally, a meta-analysis of omega-3 HUFAs provides modest evidence of clinical efficacy for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. This article recommends that a rebalancing of the essential fatty acid composition of U.S. military diets, achieve tissue compositions of HUFAs consistent with traditional Mediterranean diets, may help reduce military psychiatric distress and simultaneously increase force efficacy substantially.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hibbeln JR ; Gow RV ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.7205/MILMED-D-14-00153 ","Keywords":"*Aggression\r\nDepression/diet therapy/*prevention & control\r\n*Diet, Mediterranean\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/administration & dosage\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/administration & dosage\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-6/*administration & dosage\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\n*Impulsive Behavior\r\n*Military Personnel\r\nStress, Psychological/prevention & control\r\nUnited States\r\n*Suicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hibbeln JR, and Gow RV (2014) The potential for military diets to reduce depression, suicide, and impulsive aggression: a review of current evidence for omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids..

Clinical trials and relevant articles were identified by cross-referencing major depressive disorder (and/or variants) with the following terms: folate, homocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), L-acetylcarnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, N-acetylcysteine, L-tryptophan, zinc, magnesium, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, and inositol. Manual reviews of references were also performed using article reference lists. Abnormal levels of folate, homocysteine, and SAMe have been shown to be associated with a higher risk of depression. Numerous studies have demonstrated antidepressant activity with L-methylfolate and SAMe supplementation in individuals with depression. Additionally, the amino acids L-acetylcarnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, N-acetylcysteine, and L-tryptophan have been implicated in the development of depression and shown to exert antidepressant effects. Other agents with evidence for improving depressive symptoms include zinc, magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids, and coenzyme Q10. Potential biases and differences in study designs within and amongst the studies and reviews selected may confound results. Augmentation of antidepressant medications with various supplements targeting nutritional and physiological factors can potentiate antidepressant effects. Medical foods, particularly L-methylfolate, and other supplements may play a role in managing depression in patients with inadequate response to antidepressant therapies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hoepner CT ; McIntyre RS ; Papakostas GI ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu13030767 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMood Disorders/*therapy\r\nNutrition Therapy/*methods\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTrace Elements/*therapeutic use\r\nVitamins/*therapeutic use\r\nL-acetylcarnitine\r\nadjunctive therapy\r\nantidepressants\r\ndepression\r\ninflammation\r\nnutritional deficiencies","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hoepner CT, McIntyre RS, and Papakostas GI (2021) Impact of Supplementation and Nutritional Interventions on Pathogenic Processes of Mood Disorders: A Review of the Evidence..

BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) is defined as a major depressive episode that begins within 1 month of delivery and is experienced by roughly 13% of mothers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four Hundred participants were recruited through the internet. Data gathered via multiple choice questionnaires was statistically analyzed using SPSS and Statistical software; statistical procedures included discriminant analysis, Pearson's product moment correlation, independent t-test and cross-tabulations. RESULTS: Out of 400 participants 83 (20.8%) were affected by self-reported depression after a pregnancy between 2003 and 2008. Depressed subjects consumed oily fish and offal significantly more often than non depressed subjects. Depression was more prevalent among women with vegetarian diets. No significant difference concerning food group intake or the ratios between foods rich in nutrients beneficial to NS health and foods rich in compounds antagonising their effect were found between depressed and non depressed subjects. Iron supplementation correlated positively with zinc supplementation in both groups. Roughly 70% of women reported to have received no information about n-3 fatty acid fish oils during pregnancy; informed subjects consumed fish oils more often. The majority of subjects with self-reported depression described nutritional support during pregnancy as inadequate. CONCLUSION: Within this Austrian sample, the prevalence rate of postpartum depression was high; while the consumption of oily fish and vegetarian diets negatively correlated with depression, Patient information positively correlated with the consumption of fish oil supplements. These results indicate that further studies will be required in order to establish the exact relationship between nutrition and mental health during and after pregnancy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hogg-Kollars S ; Mortimore D ; Snow S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Consumer health information\r\nDepression postpartum\r\nDiet\r\nMaternal nutrition physiology\r\nMental health","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hogg-Kollars S, Mortimore D, and Snow S (2011) Nutrition health issues in self-reported postpartum depression..

MCT are converted into ketones and free medium chain fatty acids that, in the brain, are highly effective energy sources to mitochondria and potentially less harmful than glucose metabolism to neurons. Given the recently established link between mitochondrial dysfunction and high anxiety and depression, we performed this study to investigate the effectiveness of an MCT-enriched diet to ameliorate anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in rats. Male rats were distributed into groups, according to their anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus maze. Each group was given either MCT-supplemented diet or an isocaloric control diet for fifteen days. Starting from the eighth day of diet, rats were exposed to different behavioral tests. MCT-fed rats exhibited reduced anxiety-like behaviors and enhanced social competitiveness, while their coping responses in the forced swim test were not affected by the treatment. When evaluated at the end of the two-week MCT diet, mitochondrial respiration was reduced in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) while unchanged in the nucleus accumbens. In the mPFC, enzymes related to glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation were also decreased by MCT diet, while proteins controlling glucose and glutamate transport were increased. Altogether, our findings strongly suggest the effectiveness of MCT diet to exert anxiolytic effects. In the brain, our results point to the mPFC as a brain region in which MCT supplementation improves transport and control of energy substrates.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hollis F ; Mitchell ES ; Canto C ; Wang D ; Sandi C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.06.017 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnxiety/*diet therapy/metabolism\r\nBrain/metabolism\r\n*Competitive Behavior/physiology\r\n*Diet\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDominance-Subordination\r\nGlutamic Acid/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMitochondria/metabolism\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSingle-Blind Method\r\nTriglycerides/*administration & dosage\r\nAnxiety\r\nGlucose transporter\r\nGlycolysis\r\nHexokinase\r\nMitochondria\r\nOxidative phosphorylation\r\nSocial dominance","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hollis F, Mitchell ES, Canto C, Wang D, and Sandi C (2018) Medium chain triglyceride diet reduces anxiety-like behaviors and enhances social competitiveness in rats..

Developments in therapeutic focal brain stimulation include vagus nerve stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy and deep brain stimulation. The role of psychotherapy, both as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy, is an active avenue of investigation. Although data on these treatments are limited, preliminary results are encouraging.

Three primary approaches are currently being taken: 1) optimizing the pharmacologic modulation of monoaminergic neurotransmission, 2) developing medications that target neurotransmitter systems other than the monoamines, and 3) directly modulating neuronal activity via focal brain stimulation. We review novel therapeutic targets for developing improved antidepressant therapies, including triple monoamine reuptake inhibitors, atypical antipsychotic augmentation, dopamine receptor agonists, corticotropin-releasing factor-1 receptor antagonists, glucocorticoid receptor antagonists, substance P receptor antagonists, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, nemifitide, omega-3 fatty acids, and melatonin receptor agonists. Developments in therapeutic focal brain stimulation include vagus nerve stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy, transcranial direct current stimulation, and deep brain stimulation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Holtzheimer PE ; Nemeroff CB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11920-008-0075-5 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nBiogenic Monoamines/metabolism\r\nBrain/*drug effects/physiopathology\r\nDeep Brain Stimulation\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/physiopathology/*therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nDrugs, Investigational/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nReceptors, Neurotransmitter/drug effects\r\nTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation\r\nVagus Nerve Stimulation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Holtzheimer PE, and Nemeroff CB (2008) Novel targets for antidepressant therapies..

Some women with the premenstrual syndrome have elevated prolactin levels, but in most the prolactin concentrations are normal. It is possible that women with the syndrome are abnormally sensitive to normal amounts of prolactin. There is evidence that prostaglandin E1, derived from dietary essential fatty acids, is able to attenuate the biologic actions of prolactin and that in the absence of prostaglandin E1 prolactin has exaggerated effects. Attempts were made, therefore, to treat women who had the premenstrual syndrome with gamma-linolenic acid, an essential fatty acid precursor of prostaglandin E1. Gamma-linolenic acid is found in human, but not cows', milk and in evening primrose oil, the preparation used in these studies. Three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, one large open study on women who had failed other kinds of therapy for the premenstrual syndrome and one large open study on new patients all demonstrated that evening primrose oil is a highly effective treatment for the depression and irritability, the breast pain and tenderness, and the fluid retention associated with the premenstrual syndrome. Nutrients known to increase the conversion of essential fatty acids to prostaglandin E1 include magnesium, pyridoxine, zinc, niacin and ascorbic acid. The clinical success obtained with some of these nutrients may in part relate to their effects on essential fatty acid metabolism.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Horrobin DF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Clinical Trials as Topic\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFatty Acids, Essential/*physiology\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLinoleic Acids\r\nOenothera biennis\r\nPlant Oils\r\nPremenstrual Syndrome/diagnosis/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nProstaglandins/*physiology\r\ngamma-Linolenic Acid","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Horrobin DF (1983) The role of essential fatty acids and prostaglandins in the premenstrual syndrome..

They are essential for neuronal and especially for synaptic structure and play key roles in the signal transduction responses to dopamine, serotonin, glutamate and acetyl choline. The unsaturated fatty acid components of phospholipids are abnormal in depression, with deficits of eicosapentaenoic acid and other omega-3 fatty acids and excesses of the omega-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid. Correction of this abnormality by treatment with eicosapentaenoic acid improves depression. The fatty acid abnormalities provide a rational explanation for the associations of depression with cardiovascular disease, immunological activation, cancer, diabetic complications and osteoporosis. The abnormalities cannot be explained by diet, although diet may attenuate or exacerbate their consequences. A number of enzyme abnormalities could explain the phenomena: phospholipase A(2), and coenzyme A-independent transacylase are strong candidates.

This review focuses on comparing the effectiveness of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on depression during pregnancy or PPD after childbirth. METHODS: MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials etc. through July 2017 were searched. Studies of dietary intake and plasma and/or milk levels of omega-3 fatty acids and trials of benefits and effects of omega-3 fatty acids supplements on pregnant or postpartum women with depression were specifically selected. RESULTS: Omega-3 fatty acid deficiency, due to inadequate intake, fast depletion during pregnancy and lactation, is one of the risk factors of PPD. Associations between neuroinflammation (elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines) and aberrant neurotransmission (low serotonergic transmission activity) and risk of PPD have also been reported by numerous studies. Supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-rich oil can effectively reduce depression during pregnancy and PPD after childbirth. Long term treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-rich oil can be effective in reducing the risk of PPD in healthy women, but not in lactating women. Supplementation of DHA-rich oil to women begun at pregnancy and continued after childbirth exerts no beneficial effect on depression. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids rich in EPA during pregnancy or postpartum reduces some symptoms associated with depression. DHA supplementation to healthy pregnant women can also reduce the risk of PPD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hsu MC ; Tung CY ; Chen HE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2018.05.018 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepression/*prevention & control\r\nDepression, Postpartum/*prevention & control\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/administration & dosage\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage/deficiency\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/*prevention & control/psychology\r\nCaring\r\nGonadal hormones\r\nNeurotransmission\r\nNutrition\r\nOmega-3 fatty acids\r\nPostpartum depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hsu MC, Tung CY, and Chen HE (2018) Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in prevention and treatment of maternal depression: Putative mechanism and recommendation..

METHODS: The mouse model of depression was established through chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), the mice were intervened with n-3 PUFAs, and then the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Tail suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST) and sucrose preference test were performed to monitor the depression behavior of mice. Microglia activation was detected by Iba1 immunofluorescence, and neuronal injury was detected by Nissl staining. Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in the hippocampus were assessed via enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α messenger RNA levels. Western blot was utilized for detection of TLR4 protein expression. RESULTS: CUMS significantly reduced the sucrose preference in mice, while increased the immobility time in FST and TST. Moreover, CUMS significantly aggravated microglia activation and neuronal damage in mice and increased the levels of IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α in hippocampal tissues, however, intervention with n-3 PUFAs could improve the above effects. Further, the increased TLR4 induced by LPS partially reversed the inhibition of n-3 PUFAs on depression-like behaviors, microglial activation and inflammatory injury of hippocampal neurons. CONCLUSION: n-3 PUFAs may ameliorate depression-like behaviors via reducing hippocampal neuroinflammation in CUMS-induced mice by regulating TLR4 expression, suggesting that n-3 PUFAs may be an effective antidepressant, which provides evidence for future treatment of depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hu L ; Zeng X ; Yang K ; Peng H ; Chen J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/iid3.707 ","Keywords":"Mice\r\nAnimals\r\n*Toll-Like Receptor 4/genetics/metabolism\r\nDepression/drug therapy/etiology/metabolism\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3/pharmacology/metabolism\r\nLipopolysaccharides/toxicity\r\nInterleukin-6/pharmacology\r\nTumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism\r\nNeuroinflammatory Diseases\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nHippocampus/metabolism\r\nSucrose/metabolism/pharmacology\r\nTLR4\r\ndepression\r\ninflammation\r\nn-3 PUFAs","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hu L, Zeng X, Yang K, Peng H, and Chen J (2022) n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids improve depression-like behavior by inhibiting hippocampal neuroinflammation in mice via reducing TLR4 expression..

METHOD: We examined the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on the forced-swimming test (FST) in two groups of Sprague-Dawley rats after a six-week treatment with two different diets. Behavioral responses were observed and recorded during the 5-min test. The fatty acid composition from the whole brain tissue and the RBC membrane of the rats were analyzed. RESULTS: Comparing to control diet, omega-3 fatty acid diet significantly decreased the immobility time (218 +/- 16 vs. 183 +/- 19s, p = 0.001) and increased behaviors of swimming (32 +/- 7 vs. 45 +/- 9s, p = 0.012) and climbing (50 +/- 10 vs. 73 +/- 14s, p = 0.011) during the FST. The group in omega-3 fatty acid diet had higher levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 50% increase) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 63% increase) in the brain, and of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 27% increase) in the peripheral RBC membrane. The level of brain DHA is negatively correlated to the immobility time (r = -0.654, p = 0.006) and is positively correlated to the swimming time (r = 0.69, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The result shows that omega-3 fatty acids have a beneficial effect on preventing the development of depression-like behaviors in rats with the FST.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Huang SY ; Yang HT ; Chiu CC ; Pariante CM ; Su KP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2006.09.004 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nCholesterol, Dietary/administration & dosage\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage\r\nLipid Metabolism\r\nLipids/blood\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSwimming/*psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Huang SY, Yang HT, Chiu CC, Pariante CM, and Su KP (2008) Omega-3 fatty acids on the forced-swimming test..

METHODS: Overweight women (n = 439) were randomized to intervention groups (probiotics+FO, probiotics+placebo, FO+placebo, placebo+placebo) from early pregnancy until six months postpartum, and assessed for depressive and anxiety symptoms with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Anxiety subscale of Symptoms Checklist (SCL-90) at early and late pregnancy and three, six and 12 months postpartum. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to model the symptom courses. Dietary quality and physical activity were assessed with validated indices. RESULTS: Symptom scores were generally low. Statistically significant intervention effect was seen during pregnancy (p = 0.017): EPDS scores increased (by 1.11 points) in the FO+probiotics group and decreased (by 0.85 points) in the FO+placebo group. At 12 months postpartum, FO+placebo group had lower EPDS scores compared to probiotics+placebo group (p = 0.039). No differences in SCL scores were seen in response to the intervention. Irrespective of the intervention, three depressive and two anxiety symptoms trajectories were identified. Dietary quality correlated negatively with depressive symptoms in early pregnancy and six months postpartum and with anxiety symptoms in early pregnancy. Perinatal events including mother-reported colic were related to symptoms. LIMITATIONS: Secondary outcomes of the primary trial. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention had a modest impact on depressive symptoms. Diet and obstetric events were associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hulkkonen P ; Kataja EL ; Vahlberg T ; Koivuniemi E ; Houttu N ; Pellonperä O ; Mokkala K ; Karlsson H ; Laitinen K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2021.04.006 ","Keywords":"Anxiety/therapy\r\nChild\r\nDepression/therapy\r\n*Depression, Postpartum\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nObesity/therapy\r\nPostpartum Period\r\nPregnancy\r\n*Probiotics/therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety\r\nDepression\r\nFish oil\r\nIntervention\r\nPostpartum\r\nPregnancy\r\nProbiotics\r\ndiet","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hulkkonen P, Kataja EL, Vahlberg T, Koivuniemi E, Houttu N, Pellonperä O, Mokkala K, Karlsson H, and Laitinen K (2021) The efficacy of probiotics and/or n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids intervention on maternal prenatal and postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms among overweight and obese women..

It is explained how these fatty acids are involved in the production of eicosanoids and how these fatty acids can affect the membrane fluidity, by their incorporation into membrane phospholipids. In addition, it is described how omega-3 derivatives are shown to regulate gene transcription. In view of the pathophysiology of depression, the mechanisms of how an altered ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 could be involved in depression are discussed. Possible mechanisms could include an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can activate the HPA axis and a changed membrane fluidity, which potentially affects membrane bound enzymes, ion channels, receptor activity and neurotransmitter binding. In view of clinical trials, it is also discussed whether omega-3 supplementation could have a beneficial effect in the treatment of depressive patient. There are strong indications that an increased ratio of membrane omega-6 to omega-3 is involved in the pathogenesis of depression and so far, omega-3 supplementation has shown positive effects in clinical trials.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Husted KS ; Bouzinova EV ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.medici.2016.05.003 ","Keywords":"Clinical Trials as Topic\r\nCytokines/biosynthesis\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*metabolism/*therapy\r\nDiet, Western\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDopamine/biosynthesis\r\nEicosanoids/biosynthesis\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-6/*metabolism\r\nGene Expression Regulation\r\nHumans\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/metabolism\r\nMembrane Fluidity\r\nPhospholipids/biosynthesis\r\nSerotonin/biosynthesis\r\nArachidonic acid\r\nDepression\r\nEicosapentaenoic acid\r\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids ratio","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Husted KS, and Bouzinova EV (2016) The importance of n-6/n-3 fatty acids ratio in the major depressive disorder..

The present study analysed data from a sample of 935 randomly selected, population-based women aged 20–93 years. A validated and comprehensive dietary questionnaire ascertained the consumption of n-3 and n-6 PUFA. Another assessed fish and energy intake and provided data for a dietary quality score. The General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) measured psychological symptoms and a clinical interview (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Research Version, Non-patient edition) assessed depressive and anxiety disorders. Median dietary intakes of long-chain n-3 fatty acids (310 mg/d) were below suggested dietary target levels. The only PUFA related to categorical depressive and anxiety disorders was DHA. There was a non-linear relationship between DHA intake and depression; those in the second tertile of DHA intake were nearly 70% less likely to report a current depressive disorder compared to those in the first tertile. The relationship of DHA to anxiety disorders was linear; for those in the highest tertile of DHA intake, the odds for anxiety disorders were reduced by nearly 50% after adjustments, including adjustment for diet quality scores, compared to the lowest tertile. Those who ate fish less than once per week had higher GHQ-12 scores, and this relationship was particularly obvious in smokers. These are the first observational data to indicate a role for DHA in anxiety disorders, but suggest that the relationship between DHA and depressive disorders may be non-linear.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jacka FN ; Pasco JA ; Williams LJ ; Meyer BJ ; Digger R ; Berk M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S0007114512004102 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAnimals\r\nAnxiety Disorders/*prevention & control\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nData Collection\r\nDepressive Disorder/*prevention & control\r\n*Diet/standards\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/*administration & dosage\r\nFeeding Behavior\r\nFemale\r\nFishes\r\nHealth Status\r\nHumans\r\n*Meat\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jacka FN, Pasco JA, Williams LJ, Meyer BJ, Digger R, and Berk M (2013) Dietary intake of fish and PUFA, and clinical depressive and anxiety disorders in women..

The aim of the present study was to investigate, if and to what extent compared to placebo adjuvant O3PUFAs had a favorable impact on symptoms of depression, anxiety, sleep and emotion regulation among outpatients with MDD. METHOD: A total of 50 outpatients (mean age: M = 42.46; 68% females) took part in this randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study. They were randomly assigned either to the O3PUFA- or to the placebo-condition. Standard medication was sertraline at therapeutic dosages. At baseline, six weeks and 12 weeks later at study completion participants completed questionnaires covering symptoms of depression, anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty, sleep disturbances, and emotion regulation. In parallel, experts blind to participants' group assignment rated participants' depression with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale. RESULTS: Symptoms of depression (self- and experts' ratings) decreased over time, but more so in the O3PUFA condition, compared to the placebo condition. Likewise, anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty and sleep disturbances improved, but again more so in the O3PUFA condition. Further, regulation and control of emotions and perception of other's emotions improved over time, but more so in the O3PUFA condition. CONCLUSIONS: Among outpatients with MDD, and compared to placebo, adjuvant O3PUFAs to a standard medication improved not only symptoms of depression, but also dimensions of anxiety and sleep, and above all patients' competencies to regulate their emotions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jahangard L ; Sadeghi A ; Ahmadpanah M ; Holsboer-Trachsler E ; Sadeghi Bahmani D; Haghighi M ; Brand S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2018.09.016 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nAnxiety/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nEmotions/*drug effects\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Outcome Assessment, Health Care\r\n*Self-Control\r\nSleep Wake Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nAnxiety\r\nEmotion regulation\r\nOmega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nSleep","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jahangard L, Sadeghi A, Ahmadpanah M, Holsboer-Trachsler E, Sadeghi Bahmani D, Haghighi M, and Brand S (2018) Influence of adjuvant omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids on depression, sleep, and emotion regulation among outpatients with major depressive disorders - Results from a double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled clinical trial..

Double dummy technique was used to double blind the study. Patients were assessed at 2 week intervals. Change in HDRS was the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: Analysis of covariance for HDRS at week 8 across treatment groups was performed in 48 patients who completed at least 4 weeks of the study, with the last observation carried forward. Treatment, age of onset and baseline HDRS had a significant effect on HDRS at week 8. EPA + fluoxetine combination was significantly better than fluoxetine or EPA alone from the fourth week of treatment. Fluoxetine and EPA appear to be equally effective in controlling depressive symptoms.

However, the potential beneficial effect, on antidepressant treatment response, of adjunctive therapy with insulin sensitivity-enhancing lifestyle and dietary interventions (exercise; supplementation with: vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, probiotics or omega-3 fatty acids) has not been systematically explored. AIMS: To determine the effect of the above stated adjuncts on antidepressant treatment response in clinically depressed patients via a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: RCTs which assessed the effect, on antidepressant treatment response of adjunctive therapy with any of the interventions in comparison with treatment as usual were included. RESULTS: The interventions had a significant antidepressant effect, with SMD for follow-up (end of study) scores and change (from baseline) scores being -0.88, [95% CI: -1.19 to -0.57; P < 0.001] and -1.98 [95% CI -2.86 to -1.10; P < 0.001], respectively. The odds ratio (OR) for remission was 2.28 (95% CI 1.42 to 3.66; P < 0.001). The number-needed-to-treat (NNT) for remission was 6. Subgroup analysis of the follow-up scores revealed age effect: SMD significant in those with mean age ≤50 (-1.02 SMD; 95% CI: -1.40 to -0.64; p < 0.001) and insignificant in those with mean age >50 (-0.38 SMD (95% CI: -0.82 to 0.05; P = 0.08)). Also, the interventions were more beneficial among outpatients- SMD: -0.97 (95% CI: -1.32 to -0.62; P < 0.001) compared to inpatients- SMD: -0.34 (95% CI: -0.88 to 0.20; P = 0.22). Sensitivity analysis did not change the results. CONCLUSION: The finding that antidepressant treatment response may be improved using insulin sensitivity-enhancing lifestyle and dietary adjuncts is worthy of further exploration.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jeremiah OJ ; Cousins G ; Boland F ; Kirby BP ; Ryan BK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04845 ","Keywords":"Adjuncts\r\nAntidepressants\r\nBiological psychiatry\r\nDepression\r\nDietary supplements\r\nEndocrine system\r\nEndocrinology\r\nInsulin sensitivity\r\nLifestyle\r\nPharmacology\r\nPsychiatry\r\nSystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jeremiah OJ, Cousins G, Boland F, Kirby BP, and Ryan BK (2020) Evaluation of the effect of insulin sensitivity-enhancing lifestyle- and dietary-related adjuncts on antidepressant treatment response: A systematic review and meta-analysis..

Several studies have demonstrated that the essential oil of P. frutescens (EOPF) attenuated the depressive-like behavior in mice. The present study was designed to test the anti-depressant effects of EOPF and the possible mechanisms in an chronic, unpredictable, mild stress (CUMS)-induced mouse model. With the exposure to stressor once daily for five consecutive weeks, EOPF (3, 6, and 9 mg·kg(-1)) and a positive control drug fluoxetine (20 mg·kg(-1)) were administered through gastric intubation to mice once daily for three consecutive weeks from the 3(rd) week. Open-field test, sucrose consumption test, tail suspension test (TST), and forced swimming test (FST) were used to evaluate the behavioral activity. The contents of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), in mouse hippocampus were determined by HPLC-ECD. Serum interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that CUMS significantly decreased the levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the hippocampus, with an increase in plasma IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α levels. CUMS also reduced open-field activity, sucrose consumption, as well as increased immobility duration in FST and TST. EOPF administration could effectively reverse the alterations in the concentrations of 5-HT and 5-HIAA; reduce the IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α levels. Moreover, EOPF could effectively reverse alterations in immobility duration, sucrose consumption, and open-field activity. However, the effect was not dose-dependent. In conclusion, EOPF administration exhibited significant antidepressant-like effects in mice with CUMS-induced depression. The antidepressant activity of EOPF might be related to the relation between alteration of serotonergic responses and anti-inflammatory effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ji WW ; Li RP ; Li M ; Wang SY ; Zhang X ; Niu XX ; Li W ; Yan L ; Wang Y ; Fu Q ; Ma SP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/S1875-5364(14)60115-1 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nChronic Disease/therapy\r\nCytokines/blood\r\nDepression/blood/*drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred ICR\r\nOils, Volatile/*administration & dosage\r\nPerilla frutescens/*chemistry\r\nPlant Oils/*administration & dosage\r\nStress, Physiological/drug effects\r\nAnti-inflammation\r\nAntidepressant\r\nChronic unpredictable mild stress\r\nEssential oil\r\nPerilla frutescens","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ji WW, Li RP, Li M, Wang SY, Zhang X, Niu XX, Li W, Yan L, Wang Y, Fu Q, and Ma SP (2014) Antidepressant-like effect of essential oil of Perilla frutescens in a chronic, unpredictable, mild stress-induced depression model mice..

BACKGROUND: Patients with CHF and depression had low blood omega-3 concentrations that were associated with an elevated risk of mortality. METHODS: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial using a 400/200 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) fish oil at 2 g and an almost pure EPA at 2 g, compared with a matched placebo, daily for 12 weeks for patients with CHF and major depressive disorder. Statistical analyses included the intention-to-treat population and \"completers\" (defined as participants consuming ≥70% of the capsules and completing the final endpoint evaluation between 10 and 14 weeks). RESULTS: A total of 108 patients with CHF and major depressive disorder and a score ≥18 on the Hamilton Depression Scale who were randomized at 1:1:1 to the 3 interventions at 3 enrolling centers from June 12, 2014, to May 19, 2016; 80 (74.1%) qualified as completers. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that the levels of all omega-3 variables were significantly elevated in the omega-3 groups, whereas the placebo group showed little change; there were no between-group differences with overall depression measurements. Per-protocol exploratory analyses showed that scores on the social functioning measurement of the 36-item Short Form Health Survey improved notably in the 400/200 EPA/DHA (p = 0.040) and EPA (p = 0.10) groups compared with the placebo group. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that increased omega-3 indices were associated with improved cognitive depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Omega-3 supplementation resulted in significant increases in omega-3 levels in red blood cell counts, corresponding to a particular compound of omega-3. Changes in cognitive depressive symptoms and social function were in favor of the omega-3 supplementation. Further studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm the benefits of omega-3 supplementation on modifying psychosocial factors for patients with CHF.

Increasing evidence suggests that OEA may act as an endogenous neuroprotective factor and participate in the control of mental disorder-related behaviors. In this study, we examined whether OEA is effective against depression and investigated the role of circulating endogenous acylethanolamides during stress. Mice were subjected to 28days of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), and during the last 21days, treated with oral OEA (1.5-6mg/kg) or 6mg/kg fluoxetine. Sucrose preference and open field test activity were used to evaluate depression-like behaviors during CUMS and after OEA treatment. Weights of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were determined, and the adrenal index was measured. Furthermore, changes in serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone (CORT) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were detected. Our findings indicate that OEA normalized sucrose preferences, locomotion distances, rearing frequencies, prefrontal cortex and hippocampal atrophy, and adrenal indices. In addition, OEA reversed the abnormalities of BDNF and MDA levels and SOD activities in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, as well as changes in serum levels of ACTH, CORT, and T-AOC. The antidepressant effects of OEA may be related to the regulation of BDNF levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, antioxidant defenses, and normalizing hyperactivity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA).","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jin P ; Yu HL ; Tian-Lan  ; Zhang F ; Quan ZS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pbb.2015.04.001 ","Keywords":"Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/blood\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAntioxidants/metabolism\r\nAtrophy/drug therapy\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nCorticosterone/blood\r\nDepression/blood/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nEndocannabinoids/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nFluoxetine/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism/pathology\r\nMale\r\nMalondialdehyde/metabolism\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nOleic Acids/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/drug effects/metabolism/pathology\r\nStress, Psychological/blood/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nSuperoxide Dismutase/metabolism\r\nAntidepressant\r\nBrain-derived neurotrophic factor\r\nHPA\r\nMice\r\nOleoylethanolamide\r\nOxidative stress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jin P, Yu HL, Tian-Lan , Zhang F, and Quan ZS (2015) Antidepressant-like effects of oleoylethanolamide in a mouse model of chronic unpredictable mild stress..

The purpose of the present study was to determine the interaction between n-3 PUFAs and estrogen, and their neurotrophic mechanism in rats after the forced swimming test (FST). Rats were fed a modified American Institute of Nutrition 93G diet with 0%, 1% or 2% EPA+DHA relative to the total energy intake during 12 weeks. At 8 weeks, rats were ovariectomized and injected with either 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate (E2) or corn oil during the last 3 weeks. Both n-3 PUFA supplementation and E2 injection increased climbing and decreased immobility during the FST. Serum serotonin concentration was also increased by both n-3 PUFA and E2. N-3 PUFA and E2 decreased hippocampal expressions of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and increased cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), phosphorylated CREB and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). N-3 PUFA supplementation decreased hippocampal expression of IL-1β only in rats injected with E2. Both n-3 PUFA supplementation and E2 injection increased estrogen receptor (ER)-α in the hippocampus, but ER-β was increased only by E2 injection. Additionally, there was a significant interaction between n-3 PUFA supplementation and E2 injection on the hippocampal expression of pCREB, suggesting membrane-mediated interaction of n-3 PUFAs and E2. In conclusion, both n-3 PUFA and E2 had antidepressant-like effects by regulating serotonergic neurotransmission through BDNF and inflammatory cytokines.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jin Y ; Park Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.04.005 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nCA1 Region, Hippocampal/drug effects/metabolism/pathology\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDepression/blood/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\n*Disease Models, Animal\r\nEstradiol/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use\r\nEstrogen Replacement Therapy\r\nEstrogens/administration & dosage/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nFood-Drug Interactions\r\nInjections, Subcutaneous\r\nNerve Tissue Proteins/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism\r\nOvariectomy/adverse effects\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSerotonergic Neurons/drug effects/metabolism/pathology\r\nSerotonin/blood\r\n17β-Estradiol-3-benzoate\r\nBDNF\r\nForced swimming test\r\nInflammatory cytokines\r\nN-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nRats","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jin Y, and Park Y (2015) N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and 17β-estradiol injection induce antidepressant-like effects through regulation of serotonergic neurotransmission in ovariectomized rats..

If sustained, neuroinflammation is a common denominator of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and major depression, and of aging. Hence, limiting neuroinflammation is a real strategy for neuroinflammatory disease therapy and treatment. Recent data show that n-3 LC-PUFAs exert anti-inflammatory properties in part through the synthesis of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) such as resolvins, maresins and protectins. These SPMs are crucially involved in the resolution of inflammation.

This review presents an overview 1) of brain n-3 LC-PUFAs as precursors of SPMs with an emphasis on the effect of n-3 PUFAs on neuroinflammation, 2) of the formation and action of SPMs in the brain and their biological roles, and the possible regulation of their synthesis by environmental factors such as inflammation and nutrition and, in particular, PUFA consumption.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Joffre C ; Rey C ; Layé S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fphar.2019.01022 ","Keywords":"docosahexaenoic acid\r\neicosapentaenoic acid\r\nn-3 long-chain PUFAs\r\nneuroinflammation\r\nnutrition\r\nresolvins\r\nspecialized pro-resolving mediators","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Joffre C, Rey C, and Layé S (2019) N-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and the Resolution of Neuroinflammation..

The purpose of this study was to determine if and how food is used as medicine in psychiatric care, especially how omega-3 fatty acids are used as a supplement in the treatment of depression. This is a pilot study with a qualitative design using questionnaires and interviews among nursing students, tutor nurses and psychiatrists. Three main categories emerged: 1. Nutrition is considered important but few evaluations are made. 2. There was a lack of knowledge of the effects of Omega 3. 3. There was an unclear division of responsibility among health personnel. A change in knowledge paradigms and clarification of responsibility is called for if food-as-medicine is to take its true place in psychiatric care. It is also necessary to include CAM and holistic perspectives. Further research is needed to determine why health education and health workers do not focus on nutrition therapy in psychiatric care. Further research is also needed to reveal both the patients, the GPs and the CAM practitioners' knowledge and attitude to the use of dietary supplements.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Johannessen B ; Skagestad I ; Bergkaasa AM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ctcp.2010.08.001 ","Keywords":"*Attitude of Health Personnel\r\nDepression/*diet therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/*diet therapy\r\nDietary Fats/therapeutic use\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nInterviews as Topic\r\n*Patient Education as Topic\r\nPilot Projects\r\nProfessional Competence\r\nProfessional Role\r\nPsychiatry/*methods\r\nQualitative Research\r\nSocial Responsibility\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Johannessen B, Skagestad I, and Bergkaasa AM (2011) Food as medicine in psychiatric care: which profession should be responsible for imparting knowledge and use of omega-3 fatty acids in psychiatry..

Epidemiological and dietary studies suggest that a high intake of fish, the major source of ω-3 PUFAs, is associated with lower rates of MDDs. Meta-analyses of randomized placebo-controlled ω-3 PUFAs intervention-trials suggest that primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), but not docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is responsible for the proposed antidepressant effect. In this review, we dissect the current biological knowledge on EPA and DHA and their bioactive lipid metabolites to search for a pharmacological explanation of this, to date, unexplained clinical observation. Through enzymatic conversion by cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (ALOX), and cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase (CYP), EPA and DHA are metabolized to major anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediators. In addition, both ω-3 PUFAs are precursors for endocannabinoids, with known effects on immunomodulation, neuroinflammation, food intake and mood. Finally, both ω-3 PUFAs are crucial for the structure and organization of membranes and lipid rafts. While most biological effects are shared by these two ω-3 PUFAs, some distinct features could be identified: (1) The preferential CYP monooxygenase pathway for EPA and EPA derived eicosanoids; (2) The high CB2 receptor affinities of EPA-derived EPEA and its epoxy-metabolite 17,18-EEQ-EA, while the DHA-derived endocannabinoids lack such receptor affinities; (3) The competition of EPA but not DHA with arachidonic acid (AA) for particular glycerophospholipids. EPA and AA are preferentially incorporated into phosphatidylinositols, while DHA is mainly incorporated into phosphatidyl-ethanolamine, -serine and -choline. We propose that these distinct features may explain the superior antidepressant activity of EPA rich ω-3 PUFAs and that these are potential novel targets for future antidepressant drugs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kalkman HO ; Hersberger M ; Walitza S ; Berger GE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ijms22094393 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/pathology\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nCB2 receptor\r\nEPA-paradox\r\ncytochrome P450 isoenzyme\r\nendocannabinoid\r\nepoxide\r\nresolvin\r\nω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kalkman HO, Hersberger M, Walitza S, and Berger GE (2021) Disentangling the Molecular Mechanisms of the Antidepressant Activity of Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature..

The underlying mechanisms are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether dietary intake of the n-3 fatty acids (FAs) eicosapentaenic acid and docosahexaenoic acid could explain the relation between depressive symptoms and cardiovascular mortality. DESIGN: The Zutphen Elderly Study is a prospective cohort study conducted in the Netherlands. Depressive symptoms were measured in 1990 with the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale in 332 men aged 70-90 y and free from CVD and diabetes. Dietary factors were assessed with a cross-check dietary history method in 1990. Mortality data were collected between 1990 and 2000. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed, with adjustment for demographics and CVD risk factors. RESULTS: Compared with a low intake (x: 21 mg/d), a high intake (x: 407 mg/d) of n-3 FAs was associated with fewer depressive symptoms [odds ratio: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.95; P for trend = 0.04] at baseline and no significant reduced risk of 10-y CVD mortality [hazard ratio (HR): 0.88; 95% CI: 0.51, 1.50]. The adjusted HR for an increase in depressive symptoms with 1 SD for CVD mortality was 1.28 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.57) and did not change after additional adjustment for the intake of n-3 FAs. CONCLUSION: An average intake of approximately 400 mg n-3 FA/d may reduce the risk of depression. Our results, however, do not support the hypothesis that the intake of n-3 FAs explains the relation between depression and CVD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kamphuis MH ; Geerlings MI ; Tijhuis MA ; Kalmijn S ; Grobbee DE ; Kromhout D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/ajcn/84.6.1513 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nCardiovascular Diseases/*mortality\r\nCohort Studies\r\nConfidence Intervals\r\nDepression/complications/*epidemiology\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/administration & dosage\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/administration & dosage/physiology\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage/*physiology\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nLogistic Models\r\nMale\r\nNetherlands\r\nOdds Ratio\r\nProportional Hazards Models\r\nProspective Studies\r\nRisk Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kamphuis MH, Geerlings MI, Tijhuis MA, Kalmijn S, Grobbee DE, and Kromhout D (2006) Depression and cardiovascular mortality: a role for n-3 fatty acids?.

METHODS: Besides three selected publications reporting preclinical investigations, seven clinical trials are included, of which five had a treatment duration of 6 or 10 weeks. Primary outcome measure was the HAM-A total score reduction, while single items were assessed with regard to effects on concomitant depressive symptoms and on quality of sleep. RESULTS: In patients with subthreshold (subsyndromal) anxiety or generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), an anxiolytic effect of Silexan was evident after 2 weeks. HAM-A total score reductions between baseline and end of treatment were significantly superior to placebo in patients with subthreshold anxiety and comparable with those achieved under lorazepam or paroxetine in patients with GAD. In addition, Silexan had beneficial effects on typical concomitant symptoms of anxiety disorders, such as impaired sleep, somatic complaints, co-morbid depression or decreased quality of life. Except for mild gastrointestinal symptoms, Silexan did not induce any adverse effects and did not cause drug interactions, sedation or withdrawal symptoms at daily doses of 80 or 160 mg.

However, the mechanisms underlying their influence on brain function and metabolism remain unknown. It was investigated whether 3 types of dietary oils affected emotional behaviors in mice. Wild-type (WT) mice and sialyltransferase ST3Gal IV-knockout (KO) mice, which exhibit increased emotional and cognitive behaviors, were fed diets containing 20% dietary oils from post-weaning to adulthood. Mice were fed pellets made from control feed AIN93G powder containing 18% fish oil, soybean oil, or a mixture of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-palmitoyl glycerol (POP) and 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-3-stearoyl glycerol (SOS), plus 2% soybean oil. Once mice reached adulthood, they were subjected to fear conditioning test to measure cognitive anxiety and forced swim test to measure depression. WT mice fed the POP-SOS diet showed a 0.6-fold decrease in percent freezing with contextual fear compared with WT mice fed the control diet. KO mice fed the fish oil diet showed a 1.4-fold increase in percent freezing with contextual fear compared with KO mice fed the control diet. These findings indicate that response to contextual fear was improved in WT mice that consumed POP-SOS but aggravated in KO mice that consumed fish oils. Furthermore, KO mice showed a 0.4-fold decrease in percent freezing in response to tone fear when they were fed POP-SOS diet compared to a control diet. Thus, POP-SOS diet reduced tone fear level of KO mice until the same level of WT mice. Finally, KO mice fed the soybean oil diet showed a 1.7-fold increase in immobility in the forced swim test compared to KO mice fed the control diet. Taken together, oil-rich diets differentially modulate anxiety and depression in normal and anxious mice. Oils rich in saturated fatty acids may alleviate anxiety more strongly than other oils.\n多种膳食油已被用于预防和治疗神经系统疾病，但其对大脑功能和代谢的影响机制仍未知。本研究探究了3种不同类型膳食油对小鼠情绪行为的影响。将野生型（WT）小鼠和ST3Gal IV敲除（KO）小鼠，这些小鼠表现出情绪和认知行为的增强，从断奶到成年期饲喂含有20%膳食油的饲料。小鼠分别饲喂含有18%鱼油、大豆油或1-棕榈酰-2-油酰-3-棕榈酰甘油（POP）和1-硬脂酰-2-油酰-3-硬脂酰甘油（SOS）的饲料，加2%大豆油。小鼠成年后，进行恐惧条件反射测试以测量认知焦虑和强迫游泳测试以测量抑郁。WT小鼠饮用POP-SOS饮食时，与饮用对照饮食的WT小鼠相比，在情境恐惧中的冻结百分比降低了0.6倍。而饮用鱼油饲料的KO小鼠在情境恐惧时的冻结百分比，则是对照饲料的1.4倍。这些发现表明，食用POP-SOS可以改善WT小鼠对情境恐惧的反应，但却使KO小鼠对情境恐惧的反应变得恶化。此外，KO小鼠饮用POP-SOS饮食时，在感觉恐惧时的冻结百分比比饮用对照饮食下降了0.4倍，这表明POP-SOS饮食使KO小鼠的感觉恐惧水平降低，直到与WT小鼠水平一致。最后，饮用大豆油饲料的KO小鼠在强迫游泳测试中的静止时间比饮用对照饮食的KO小鼠增加了1.7倍。综上所述，食物富含不同类型的膳食油会不同程度地调节正常和焦虑小鼠的焦虑和抑郁，而富含饱和脂肪酸的油可能比其他油更有效地缓解焦虑。","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kato K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0120753 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nCognition/*drug effects\r\nConditioning, Psychological/drug effects\r\nDietary Fats, Unsaturated/*pharmacology\r\nEmotions/*drug effects\r\nFatty Acids/pharmacology\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/pharmacology\r\nFear/psychology\r\nFemale\r\nGene Knockout Techniques\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nSialyltransferases/deficiency/genetics\r\nbeta-Galactoside alpha-2,3-Sialyltransferase","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kato K (2015) Differential effects of dietary oils on emotional and cognitive behaviors..

Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), lipid profile by standard biochemical procedures, and LDL- and HDL-subfractions by the Lipoprint system. Basic biochemical parameters including lipid profile were compared with levels in 20 healthy children and were in the physiological range. Improvement of symptoms in the group supplemented with a fish oil emulsion rich in omega-3 FA in contrast to omega-6 FA (emulsion of sunflower oil) has been observed. We are the first to report that omega-3 FAs, but not omega-6 FA, increase large HDL subfractions (anti-atherogenic) after 12 weeks of supplementation and decrease small HDL subfractions (proatherogenic) in depressed children. We found a negative correlation between CDI score and HDL-CH and the large HDL subfraction, but not LDL-CH subfractions. CDI score was not associated with erythrocyte membrane fluidity. Our results suggest that HDL-CH and its subfractions, but not LDL-CH may play a role in the pathophysiology of depressive disorder. The study was registered under ISRCTN81655012.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Katrenčíková B ; Vaváková M ; Waczulíková I ; Oravec S ; Garaiova I ; Nagyová Z ; Hlaváčová N ; Ďuračková Z ; Trebatická J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/biom10101427 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBlood Chemical Analysis\r\nChemical Fractionation\r\nChild\r\nDepressive Disorder/blood/*diet therapy/drug therapy/pathology\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nErythrocyte Membrane/chemistry/physiology\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLipids/analysis/*blood\r\nLipoproteins/analysis/blood\r\nMale\r\nMembrane Fluidity/*physiology\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSlovakia\r\nchildren and adolescents\r\ndepressive disorder\r\nfluidity of membrane\r\nlipid profile\r\nomega-3 fatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Katrenčíková B, Vaváková M, Waczulíková I, Oravec S, Garaiova I, Nagyová Z, Hlaváčová N, Ďuračková Z, and Trebatická J (2020) Lipid Profile, Lipoprotein Subfractions, and Fluidity of Membranes in Children and Adolescents with Depressive Disorder: Effect of Omega-3 Fatty Acids in a Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Study..

However, it is not clear whether the OS is the cause or consequence of the disorder. We investigated markers of oxidative stress (8-isoprostane (8-IsoP-U), lipoperoxides (LP), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and nitrotyrosine (NT)) and antioxidant protection (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) in 60 paediatric and adolescent patients with depressive disorder (DD) compared to healthy controls. The patients were divided into two groups (1:1). One group received an emulsion of omega-3 fatty acid (FA), and the other group an emulsion of sunflower oil with omega-6 FA for 12 weeks. The levels of 8-IsoP-U, AOPP and NT were increased, and GPx activity was decreased in patients compared to the controls. We found a significant positive correlation of the Children's Depression Inventory score with NT and a negative correlation with TEAC, SOD and GPx. NT correlated positively with the baseline omega-6/omega-3 FA ratio and a negatively with SOD. A supplementation with omega-3 FA, but not with omega-6 FA, decreased 8-IsoP-U, AOPP, NT levels and increased TEAC and SOD activity. Our results suggest that NT may play a role in the pathophysiology of DD, while elevated isoprostane is likely caused by the high omega-6/omega-3 FA ratio. Omega-3 FA supplementation reduces oxidative stress in patients with DD.

The present study aimed to determine the effect of omega-3 supplement on mild depression during pregnancy among primiparous women. METHOD: In this double-blind clinical trial, 80 primiparous women were randomly divided into 2 groups of omega-3 and placebo. The experimental group received 1 g omega-3 capsules for 6 weeks. The study data were collected by completing Beck Depression Inventory before and 6 weeks after the intervention. RESULTS: The results revealed a significant difference between the two groups regarding the mean score of depression before and after the intervention (P<0.001). Besides, the mean difference of depression score before and after the intervention was significantly higher in the omega-3 group (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Considering the study results, using omega-3 supplement is a suitable method for recovery from mild depression during pregnancy with no complications for mothers and infants.

METHODS: Sixty-four African American women were enrolled at 16-21 weeks of gestation. Power calculations were computed using published standard deviations for the Perceived Stress Scale and the Trier Social Stress Test. Participants were randomized to either 450 mg per day of DHA (n=43) or placebo (n=21). At baseline and at 24 and 30 weeks of gestation, perceived stress was assessed by self-report. Cortisol response to a controlled stressor, the Trier Social Stress Test was measured from saliva samples collected upon arrival to the laboratory and after the completion of the Trier Social Stress Test. RESULTS: Women in the DHA supplementation group reported lower levels of perceived stress at 30 weeks of gestation, controlling for depression and negative life events (mean 27.4 compared with 29.5, F [3, 47] 5.06, P=.029, Cohen's d=0.65). Women in the DHA supplementation had lower cortisol output in response to arriving to the laboratory and a more modulated response to the stressor (F [1.78, 83.85] 6.24, P=.004, Cohen's d=0.76). CONCLUSION: Pregnant women living in urban low-income environments who received DHA reported reduced perceived stress and lower levels of stress hormones in the third trimester.

However, meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) yield mixed findings. This systematic review and meta-analysis reviewed the evidence and assessed the efficacy of EPA, DHA and DPAn-3 in reducing the severity of anxiety and depression with specific consideration to methodological complications unique to the field e.g., dose and ratio of omega-3 PUFAs and placebo composition. Random-effects meta-analysis of ten RCTs comprising 1426 participants revealed statistically significant reduction in depression severity with EPA-enriched interventions at proportions ≥ 60% of total EPA + DHA (SMD: -0.36; 95% CI: -0.68, -0.05; p = 0.02) (I(2) = 86%) and EPA doses between ≥ 1 g/day and < 2 g/day (SMD: -0.43; 95% CI: -0.79, -0.07; p = 0.02) (I(2) = 88%); however, EPA doses ≥ 2 g/day were not associated with significant therapeutic effects (SMD: -0.20; 95% CI: -0.48, 0.07; p = 0.14). Only one study reported significant reduction in anxiety severity with 2.1 g/day EPA (85.6% of total EPA + DHA), therefore meta-analysis was not possible. No trials administering DPAn-3 were identified. Visual examination of the funnel plot revealed asymmetry, suggesting publication bias and heterogeneity amongst the trials. These results support the therapeutic potential of EPA in depression at proportions ≥ 60% of total EPA + DHA and doses ≥ 1 g/day and < 2 g/day. The observed publication bias and heterogeneity amongst the trials reflect the need for more high-quality trials in this area with consideration to the unique nature of omega-3 PUFAs research, to more fully elucidate the therapeutic potential of EPA, DHA and DPAn-3.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kelaiditis CF ; Gibson EL ; Dyall SC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.plefa.2023.102572 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nHumans\r\n*Eicosapentaenoic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated\r\nAnxiety/drug therapy\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nAnxiety\r\nDepression\r\nDocosahexaenoic acid\r\nEicosapentaenoic acid\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nSystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kelaiditis CF, Gibson EL, and Dyall SC (2023) Effects of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on reducing anxiety and/or depression in adults; A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials..

One month after stopping the capsules at the follow-up visit, weight was measured to compare weight relapse between the two groups. RESULTS: Forty five patients finished the study. No significant differences were seen between groups regarding demographic and clinical variables at baseline. Using repeated measures ANOVA, omega-3 significantly reduced depression compared with the placebo (P = 0.05). Mean ± SD weight reduction in omega-3 group 3.07 ± 3.4 kg and in the placebo group was 1.16 ± 2.7 kg and the difference between groups was significant using independent sample t-test (p = 0.049). Patients in the omega-3 group did not show significantly more side effects compared to the placebo but they were not successful in preventing weight regain one month after the end of the study. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings omega-3 capsule as a safe over-the-counter supplement might be helpful in reducing the signs of depression and also body weight in patients with co-morbidity of depression and obesity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Keshavarz SA ; Mostafavi SA ; Akhondzadeh S ; Mohammadi MR ; Hosseini S ; Eshraghian MR ; Chamari M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.clnesp.2018.03.001 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAffect/*drug effects\r\nAge Factors\r\nBody Composition/drug effects\r\nComorbidity\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/epidemiology/physiopathology/psychology\r\n*Dietary Supplements/adverse effects\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIran/epidemiology\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nObesity/*drug therapy/epidemiology/physiopathology/psychology\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSex Factors\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nWeight Loss/*drug effects\r\nBody weight\r\nDepression\r\nObesity\r\nOmega-3\r\nRandomized clinical trial (RCT)\r\nWomen","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Keshavarz SA, Mostafavi SA, Akhondzadeh S, Mohammadi MR, Hosseini S, Eshraghian MR, and Chamari M (2018) Omega-3 supplementation effects on body weight and depression among dieter women with co-morbidity of depression and obesity compared with the placebo: A randomized clinical trial..

The study design was randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial. Totally 136 shift workers with a depression score ≥10 in 21-item Beck Depression Rating Scale were randomly assigned to receive omega-3 (180 mg eicosapentaenoate acid and 120 mg docosahexaenoic acid) or/and vitamin C 250 mg or placebo twice daily (with the same taste and shape as omega-3 and vitamin C) for 60 days in four groups. Depression score, interleukin-6 and high sensitivity C-reactive protein were measured at baseline and after 60 days. This study showed that supplementation of omega-3 plus vitamin C is associated with a decrease in depression score (p<0.05). Supplementation of omega-3 without vitamin C, is associated with a reduction in depression score (p<0.0001) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration (p<0.01). Therefore omega-3 supplementation showed a better effect on reducing depression score and high sensitivity C-reactive protein, but supplementation of vitamin C along with omega-3 did not have significant effect on change in C-reactive protein level compared to omega-3 alone.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 136 men who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and had a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score ≥ 10 were selected. Among the participants, 33 received omega-3 fatty acid soft gel (1000 mg twice daily) with vitamin C (250 mg twice daily) (group 1), 31 took omega-3 fatty acid supplements and vitamin C placebo (group 2), 30 took omega-3 fatty acid supplement placebo and vitamin C (group 3), and 32 received omega-3 fatty acid supplement placebo and vitamin C placebo (group 4) for 2 months. Measured were serum MDA, TAC concentrations, and BDI scores at baseline and after 2 months. RESULTS: This study showed that the BDI score was reduced significantly in all 4 groups, however, the level of decrease was more in the omega-3 fatty acid (alone) supplementation group (mean 6.29 score decrease) (p < 0.001). MDA level decreased significantly in groups with omega-3 fatty acids (mean 0.78 μmol/L ± 1.64 μmol/L decrease) (p = 0.014) or vitamin C supplementation alone (mean 0.74 μmol/L ± 1.55 μmol/L decrease) (p = 0.014), but not in combination.

Multiple structural, metabolic, and biochemical abnormalities are evident in the brain's cortex, subcortex, and deeper regions. This disorder is highly genetically conditioned but also highly susceptible to environmental stressors: prenatal or perinatal insults, childhood sexual or physical abuse, challenging life events, substance abuse, and other toxic chemical exposures. Its high morbidity, lost productivity, and suicide risk place a great toll on society. Since World War II, BD has been steadily worsening with earlier age of onset, greater intensity of symptoms, and development of drug resistance. Incidence in children is rising and misdiagnosis is common. Disciplined management of the many risk factors is essential, including cognitive psychotherapy and support from family and community. Lithium has been the foundational treatment, followed by valproate and other mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. Several single-nutrient and multinutrient supplements have also proven beneficial. Controlled, double-blind trials show multinutrient combinations of vitamins, minerals, orthomolecules, herbals, and the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA to be effective monotherapy. The molecular action of lithium and valproate converge with nutrients on the level of the cell membrane and its molecular signal transduction systems. This emergent, unified rationale presages effective integrative management of bipolar disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kidd PM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nBipolar Disorder/diet therapy/drug therapy/*etiology/physiopathology/therapy\r\nCell Membrane/drug effects/*physiology\r\nChild\r\nHumans\r\nNimodipine\r\nPsychotherapy\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/therapeutic use\r\nSignal Transduction/drug effects/physiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kidd PM (2004) Bipolar disorder and cell membrane dysfunction.

They function exclusively via cell membranes, in which they are anchored by phospholipid molecules. DHA is proven essential to pre- and postnatal brain development, whereas EPA seems more influential on behavior and mood. Both DHA and EPA generate neuroprotective metabolites. In double-blind, randomized, controlled trials, DHA and EPA combinations have been shown to benefit attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD), autism, dyspraxia, dyslexia, and aggression. For the affective disorders, meta-analyses confirm benefits in major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder, with promising results in schizophrenia and initial benefit for borderline personality disorder. Accelerated cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) correlate with lowered tissue levels of DHA/EPA, and supplementation has improved cognitive function. Huntington disease has responded to EPA. Omega-3 phospholipid supplements that combine DHA/EPA and phospholipids into the same molecule have shown marked promise in early clinical trials. Phosphatidylserine with DHA/EPA attached (Omega-3 PS) has been shown to alleviate AD/HD symptoms. Krill omega-3 phospholipids, containing mostly phosphatidylcholine (PC) with DHA/EPA attached, markedly outperformed conventional fish oil DHA/EPA triglycerides in double-blind trials for premenstrual syndrome/dysmenorrhea and for normalizing blood lipid profiles. Krill omega-3 phospholipids demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity, lowering C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in a double-blind trial. Utilizing DHA and EPA together with phospholipids and membrane antioxidants to achieve a triple cell membrane synergy may further diversify their currently wide range of clinical applications.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kidd PM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*Affect/drug effects\r\nAggression/drug effects\r\nAnimals\r\nApraxias/diet therapy\r\nAttention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/diet therapy\r\nAutistic Disorder/diet therapy\r\n*Behavior/drug effects\r\nBrain/embryology/growth & development\r\nChild\r\n*Cognition/drug effects\r\nDementia/diet therapy/prevention & control\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/*therapeutic use\r\nDysmenorrhea/diet therapy\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/physiology/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nHuntington Disease/diet therapy\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nInflammation Mediators/physiology\r\nMembrane Lipids/physiology\r\nMood Disorders/diet therapy\r\nPhospholipids/physiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kidd PM (2007) Omega-3 DHA and EPA for cognition, behavior, and mood: clinical findings and structural-functional synergies with cell membrane phospholipids..

To determine whether n-3 decreases proinflammatory cytokine production and depressive and anxiety symptoms in healthy young adults, this parallel group, placebo-controlled, double-blind 12-week RCT compared n-3 supplementation with placebo. The participants, 68 medical students, provided serial blood samples during lower-stress periods as well as on days before an exam. The students received either n-3 (2.5 g/d, 2085 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 348 mg docosahexanoic acid) or placebo capsules that mirrored the proportions of fatty acids in the typical American diet. Compared to controls, those students who received n-3 showed a 14% decrease in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated interleukin 6 (IL-6) production and a 20% reduction in anxiety symptoms, without significant change in depressive symptoms. Individuals differ in absorption and metabolism of n-3 PUFA supplements, as well as in adherence; accordingly, planned secondary analyses that used the plasma n-6:n-3 ratio in place of treatment group showed that decreasing n-6:n-3 ratios led to lower anxiety and reductions in stimulated IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production, as well as marginal differences in serum TNF-α. These data suggest that n-3 supplementation can reduce inflammation and anxiety even among healthy young adults. The reduction in anxiety symptoms associated with n-3 supplementation provides the first evidence that n-3 may have potential anxiolytic benefits for individuals without an anxiety disorder diagnosis.

This three-arm randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind 4-month trial compared responses to (1) 2.5 g/d n-3 PUFAs, or (2) 1.25 g/d n-3 PUFAs, or (3) placebo capsules that mirrored the proportions of fatty acids in the typical American diet. Serum interleukin-6 decreased by 10% and 12% in our low and high dose n-3 groups, respectively, compared to a 36% increase in the placebo group. Similarly, low and high dose n-3 groups showed modest 0.2% and -2.3% changes in serum tumor necrosis factor alpha, compared to a 12% increase in the control group.

N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have antidepressant effects, but their effect on rats exposed to combined stress has been not investigated. This study aimed to investigate whether n-3 PUFA supplementation had antidepressant-like effects in rat models of depression induced by a combination of chronic mild stress (CMS) and maternal separation (MS) through the modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and neurotransmission. Rats were fed the n-3 PUFA diet during the pre-weaning or post-weaning period or for lifetime, and allocated to different groups based on the type of induced stress: non-stress (NS), CMS + MS, or CMS alone. N-3 PUFA improved the depressive behaviors of the CMS alone and CMS + MS groups and modulated the HPA-axis by reducing the circulating adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticosterone, and corticotropin-releasing factor expression, and increasing glucocorticoid receptor expression. N-3 PUFA also modulated brain phospholipid fatty acid concentration, thus reducing inflammatory cytokines; improved the serotonergic pathway, thus increasing the expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), serotonin-1A receptor, and serum levels of serotonin; but did not affect glutamatergic neurotransmission. Furthermore, n-3 PUFA decreased the hippocampal expression of microRNA-218 and -132, increased that of microRNA-155, and its lifetime supplementation was more beneficial than pre- or post-weaning supplementation. This study suggests that n-3 PUFA has an antidepressant effect in rats exposed to combined stress, through the improvement of the HPA-axis abnormalities, the BDNF-serotonergic pathway, and the modulation of microRNAs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kim EY ; Choi JE ; Kim M ; Hong J ; Park Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s12035-020-01980-9 ","Keywords":"Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/blood\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBody Weight/drug effects\r\nBrain/metabolism\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nCorticotropin-Releasing Hormone/blood\r\nCytokines/metabolism\r\nDepression/blood/drug therapy\r\nDinoprostone/blood\r\nFatty Acids/analysis\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHippocampus/metabolism\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism\r\nNeurotransmitter Agents/metabolism\r\nPhospholipids/metabolism\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System/*drug effects\r\nProtein Subunits/metabolism\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nReceptors, Glutamate/metabolism\r\nSerotonin/blood\r\nStress, Psychological/blood/*complications\r\nSynaptic Transmission/*drug effects\r\nBDNF-serotonergic pathway\r\nChronic mild stress\r\nDepression\r\nHPA-axis\r\nMaternal separation\r\nN-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kim EY, Choi JE, Kim M, Hong J, and Park Y (2020) N-3 PUFA Have Antidepressant-like Effects Via Improvement of the HPA-Axis and Neurotransmission in Rats Exposed to Combined Stress..

Cinnamomum verum (CV) has anti-inflammatory effects, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects after immunological activation still remain elusive. PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of CV in improving depressive-like behavior and explore its underlying mechanism in T lymphocytes. METHODS: Mice were randomly divided into Control, LPS, LPS plus fluoxetine, LPS plus CV, and LPS plus MCA groups. Behavior was evaluated using forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). The experimental group mice were exposed to LPS to induce depressive-like behavior. Cell viability was measured upon treating splenic T lymphocytes and Jurkat T cells with CV. Cytokine activity was measured using ELISA and RT-qPCR. The components of CV were analyzed by HPLC. NFAT expression was evaluated by western blotting, immunofluorescence, and luciferase assay. To verify the half-life of NFAT mRNA, Jurkat cells were treated with actinomycin D for 1.5, 3, and 4.5 h. RESULTS: CV effectively prevents inflammation-induced depressive-like behaviors. CV dose-dependently decreased protein and mRNA levels of TNFα and IL-2. Inhibition of TNFα and IL-2 production involves an MCA-mediated decrease in NFAT mRNA level, rather than inhibition of nuclear translocation. This mechanism was independent of NFAT transcription inducer p38 MAPK; it can be attributed to the promotion of NFAT mRNA decay. CONCLUSION: Overall, MCA might be an alternative or adjuvant to existing NFAT-targeting immunosuppressants for clinical prophylaxis or therapy in the context of inflammation-induced depressive disorder or other T-cell-associated inflammatory disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kim HJ ; Kim H ; Choi Y ; Lee JH ; Kim D ; Lee SK ; Park KS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153703 ","Keywords":"Acrolein/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology\r\nAnimals\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\n*Cinnamomum zeylanicum/chemistry\r\n*Depression/drug therapy\r\nLipopolysaccharides\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred ICR\r\n*NFATC Transcription Factors\r\n*RNA Stability\r\nT-Lymphocytes/*drug effects\r\nCinnamomum verum\r\nIL2\r\nInflammatory depression\r\nNFAT\r\nO-Methoxycinnamaldehyde\r\nTNFα","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kim HJ, Kim H, Choi Y, Lee JH, Kim D, Lee SK, and Park KS (2021) Cinnamomum verum-derived O-methoxycinnamaldehyde prevents lipopolysaccharide-induced depressive-like behavior in mice via NFAT mRNA stability in T lymphocytes..

Twenty-six university students (16 female and 10 male students; mean age, 21.5 ± 1.9 years) participated in this study. Fir essential oil was used for olfactory stimulation, with normal room air as the control. The odor was administered for 3 min. Heart rate variability and heart rate were used as indicators of autonomic nervous system activity. The Profile of Mood States and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were used as psychological indicators. The ln(Low Frequency/High Frequency) ratio, which is an indicator of sympathetic nervous activity reflecting a stressful or aroused state during stimulation with fir essential oil, was significantly lower than during the control condition. Assessment of psychological indicators showed that the positive mood of \"vigor\" improved significantly and negative moods of \"tension-anxiety\", \"depression\", \"anger-hostility\", \"fatigue\" and anxiety levels reduced significantly after inhaling fir essential oil compared to the control condition. This study showed that inhalation of fir essential oil has physiologically and psychologically relaxing effects, with differences in results depending on the sex of the participants.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kim C ; Song C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ijerph19095063 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*COVID-19\r\nFemale\r\nHeart Rate\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\n*Oils, Volatile/pharmacology\r\nPandemics\r\nRelaxation\r\nStress, Psychological\r\nStudents\r\nUniversities\r\nYoung Adult\r\nfir essential oil\r\nforest healing\r\nforest therapy\r\nheart rate\r\nheart rate variability\r\nprofile of mood states\r\nrelaxation\r\nsex comparison\r\nstate-trait anxiety inventory\r\nstress relief","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kim C, and Song C (2022) Physiological and Psychological Relaxation Effects of Fir Essential Oil on University Students..

The high-frequency value reflecting the parasympathetic nervous system activity significantly increased after footbath using Lu essential oil.

Therefore, our goal was to evaluate the effect of a dietary supplement on vaccine-induced depression. Sixty C57BL/6 female mice were immunized with HPVv-Gardasil, aluminum or the vehicle (n = 20 each group), and half of each group were fed 5 times per week with 0.2 ml of a dietary supplement enriched with phosphatidylcholine. The mice were evaluated for depression at 3 months of age, by the forced swimming test. Both the Gardasil and the aluminum-treated mice developed depressive-like behavior when compared to the control group. The HPVv-Gardasil-immunized mice supplemented with phosphatidylcholine significantly reduced their depressive symptoms. This study confirms our previous studies demonstrating depressive-like behavior in mice vaccinated with HPVv-Gardasil. In addition, it demonstrates the ability of phosphatidylcholine-enriched diet to attenuate depressive-like behavior in the HPVv-Gardasil-vaccinated mice.

In this narrative review, we will summarize and discuss recent findings from epidemiological, interventional and experimental studies linking dietary consumption of omega-3 fatty acids to cognitive function in healthy adults. Furthermore, affective disorders and schizophrenia (SZ) are characterized by cognitive dysfunction encompassing several domains. Cognitive dysfunction is closely related to impaired functioning and quality of life across these conditions. Therefore, the current review focues on the potential influence of omega-3 fatty acids on cognition in SZ and affective disorders. In sum, current data predominantly from mechanistic models and animal studies suggest that adjunctive omega-3 fatty acid supplementation could lead to improved cognitive functioning in SZ and affective disorders. However, besides its translational promise, evidence for clinical benefits in humans has been mixed. Notwithstanding evidences indicate that adjunctive omega-3 fatty acids may have benefit for affective symptoms in both unipolar and bipolar depression, to date no randomized controlled trial had evaluated omega-3 as cognitive enhancer for mood disorders, while a single published controlled trial suggested no therapeutic benefit for cognitive improvement in SZ. Considering the pleiotropic mechanisms of action of omega-3 fatty acids, the design of well-designed controlled trials of omega-3 supplementation as a novel, domain-specific, target for cognitive impairment in SZ and affective disorders is warranted.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Knöchel C ; Voss M ; Grüter F ; Alves GS ; Matura S ; Sepanski B ; Stäblein M ; Wenzler S ; Prvulovic D ; Carvalho AF ; Oertel-Knöchel V ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1570159x13666150630173047 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nCognition Disorders/*etiology/*therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nMood Disorders/*complications\r\nSchizophrenia/*complications","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Knöchel C, Voss M, Grüter F, Alves GS, Matura S, Sepanski B, Stäblein M, Wenzler S, Prvulovic D, Carvalho AF, and Oertel-Knöchel V (2015) Omega 3 Fatty Acids: Novel Neurotherapeutic Targets for Cognitive Dysfunction in Mood Disorders and Schizophrenia?.

Lemon oil had the strongest anti-stress effect in all three behavioral tasks. We further investigated a regulatory mechanism of the lemon oil by pre-treatments with agonists or antagonists to benzodiazepine, 5-HT, DA, and adrenaline receptors by the EPM and the FST. The anti-stress effect of lemon oil was significantly blocked by pre-treatment with frumazenil, benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, or apomorphine, a nonselective DA receptor agonist. In contrast, agonists or antagonists to the 5-HT receptor and the alpha-2 adrenaline receptor did not affect the anti-stress effect of lemon oil. Buspirone, DOI, and mianserine blocked the antidepressant-like effect of lemon oil in the FST, but WAY100,635 did not. These findings suggest that the antidepressant-like effect of lemon oil is closely related with the 5-HTnergic pathway, especially via 5-HT(1A) receptor. Moreover, the lemon oil significantly accelerated the metabolic turnover of DA in the hippocampus and of 5-HT in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. These results suggest that lemon oil possesses anxiolytic, antidepressant-like effects via the suppression of DA activity related to enhanced 5-HTnergic neurons.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Komiya M ; Takeuchi T ; Harada E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2006.05.006 ","Keywords":"Administration, Inhalation\r\nAnalysis of Variance\r\nAnimals\r\nAnxiety/drug therapy\r\nAromatherapy\r\nCitrus\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nDopamine/metabolism\r\nExploratory Behavior/*drug effects\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nLavandula\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred ICR\r\nNeostriatum/drug effects/metabolism\r\nOils, Volatile/administration & dosage\r\nPlant Oils/*administration & dosage\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/drug effects/metabolism\r\nReceptors, Adrenergic/drug effects\r\nReceptors, Dopamine/*drug effects\r\nReceptors, GABA-A/drug effects\r\nReceptors, Serotonin/*drug effects\r\nRosa\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nSmell/physiology\r\nStatistics, Nonparametric\r\nStress, Psychological/*drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Komiya M, Takeuchi T, and Harada E (2006) Lemon oil vapor causes an anti-stress effect via modulating the 5-HT and DA activities in mice..

Although several studies have reported that phosphatidylserine (PS) may be effective for late life depression and that omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA have also proven beneficial for many higher mental functions, including depression, no concrete conclusion has been reached. This study was performed to clarify the effect of PS and omega-3 fatty acid-containing supplement for late life depression by not only clinical evaluation but also salivary cortisol levels. Eighteen elderly subjects with major depression were selected for the study. In all, insufficient improvement had been obtained by antidepressant therapy for at least 6 months. The exclusion criteria from prior brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) included the presence of structural MRI findings compatible with stroke or other gross brain lesions or malformations, but not white matter hypersensitivities. They took a supplement containing PS 100 mg, DHA 119 mg and EPA 70 mg three times a day for 12 weeks. The effects of the supplement were assessed using the 17-item Hamilton depression scale (HAM-D17) and the basal levels and circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol. The study adopted them as indices because: salivary cortisol levels are high in patients with depression, their circadian rhythm related to salivary cortisol is often irregular, and these symptoms are alleviated as depression improves. The mean HAM-D17 in all subjects taking the supplement was significantly improved after 12 weeks of taking the supplement. These subjects were divided into 10 non-responders and 8 responders. The basal levels and circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol were normalized in the responders while not in non-responders. PS and omega-3 fatty acids, or other elements of the supplement, may be effective for late life depression, associated with the correction of basal levels and circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Komori T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4081/mi.2015.5647 ","Keywords":"HAM-D\r\ncortisol\r\nlate life depression\r\nomega-3 fatty acids\r\nphosphatidylserine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Komori T (2015) The Effects of Phosphatidylserine and Omega-3 Fatty Acid-Containing Supplement on Late Life Depression..

We found that inhalation of either Roman chamomile or one of its main components α-pinene, attenuated depressive-like behavior in WKY rats in the forced swim test. Using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation analysis (iTRAQ), we found that inhalation of α-pinene increased expression of proteins that are involved in oxidative phosphorylation, such as cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6C-2, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 7A2, ATPase inhibitor in the hippocampus, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6C-2, ATP synthase subunit e, Acyl carrier protein, and Cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 6 in the PFC (prefrontal cortex). In addition, using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction technique, we confirmed an increase of parvalbumin mRNA expression in the hippocampus, which was shown to be upregulated by 2.8-fold in iTRAQ analysis, in α-pinene treated WKY rats. These findings collectively suggest the involvement of mitochondrial functions and parvalbumin-related signaling in the antidepressant effect of α-pinene inhalation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kong Y ; Wang T ; Wang R ; Ma Y ; Song S ; Liu J ; Hu W ; Li S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11427-016-9034-8 ","Keywords":"Adenosine Triphosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors\r\nAnimals\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\n*Chamomile\r\nDepression/*therapy\r\nElectron Transport Complex IV/metabolism\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/enzymology\r\nOils, Volatile/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nOxidative Phosphorylation\r\nRats\r\nRats, Inbred WKY\r\nReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction\r\naromatherapy\r\nhippocampus\r\niTRAQ analysis\r\nmajor depressive disorder\r\nparvalbumin\r\nα-pinene","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kong Y, Wang T, Wang R, Ma Y, Song S, Liu J, Hu W, and Li S (2017) Inhalation of Roman chamomile essential oil attenuates depressive-like behaviors in Wistar Kyoto rats..

The current paper is an effort to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in treatment of mood disorders. DESIGN: We searched Medline, Embase, PsychInfo, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials registry up to June 2008 for randomized trials investigating efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in mood disorders.We conducted random effects meta-analyses.We used the I2 statistic to quantify between-study inconsistency, and conducted pre-specified subgroup analyses to explore potential explanations for inconsistency. OBSERVATIONS: We included 21 trials in our systematic review and found 13 trials to be eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled standardized mean difference in depressed mood states (n = 554 in 12 trials) was -0.47 (95% CI:-0.92,-0.02; I2 = 82.7; p = 0.07) and in manic mood states (n = 126 in 4 trials) was 0.22 (95% CI: -0.21, 0.65; I2 = 40.5; p = 0.31).We did not identify any treatment- subgroup interaction across forms of omega-3 fatty acids preparations (P = 0.99) or patient diagnosis (bipolar vs. unipolar depressive disorder; P = 0.96); there was a significant correlation between omega-3 fatty acids dose and treatment effect on depressive symptoms (r = 0.5, p = 0.04), but not on manic symptoms (P = 0.3). CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests that omega-3 fatty acids are a potential treatment of depressive disorders, but not mania. The unexplained between-study inconsistency and imprecision of the pooled estimates mitigate this suggestion. Large randomized placebo-controlled trials are needed to better estimate the value of this intervention for patients with depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kraguljac NV ; Montori VM ; Pavuluri M ; Chai HS ; Wilson BS ; Unal SS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kraguljac NV, Montori VM, Pavuluri M, Chai HS, Wilson BS, and Unal SS (2009) Efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in mood disorders - a systematic review and metaanalysis..

The effects of omega-3 PUFAs on the course of the stress-induced and endogenous depression are under investigation. We have previously demonstrated that synthetic inhibitors of prolyl endopeptidase (PEP; EC 3.4.21.26) exhibit antidepressant-like properties in different experimental models of emotional and motivational disorders. It is known that omega-3 PUFAs show PEP inhibitory activity. The purpose of this work was to study the effects of the drug Omacor (Abbot, Germany) containing omega-3 PUFAs, when administered to the lactating Wistar rats, on the emotional and motivational behavior of the offspring with the experimental anxiety-depressive disorder caused by the inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP- IV; CD 26; EC 3.4.14.5) diprotin A on postnatal day (PND) 5-18 (second - third weeks of postnatal development). METHODS: We used conventional methods of assessing the emotional and motivational behavior and sensorimotor reactivity in animals. Omega-3 PUFAs were administered to lactating rats at a dose 0.3 g / kg, per os, for 28 days starting from the next day after the birthing. Diprotin A was administered systemically at a dose of 2 mg/kg. RESULTS: Omega-3 PUFAs when administered to the lactating females, prevented the development of depressive-like behavior in adolescent rats neonatally exposed to DPP-IV inhibitor diprotin A, and contributed to the formation of antidepressive phenotype in control rats. However, under these circumstances, the omega-3 PUFAs increased anxiety and did not prevent an increase in aggression in rats with the experimental anxiety-depressive disorder and increased anxiety and stress-provoked aggression in the controls. CONCLUSION: The results support the hypothesis on the involvement of proline-specific peptidases DPP-IV and PEP in the mechanisms of emotional and motivational disturbances and expand the spectrum of omega-3 PUFAs action.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Krupina NA ; Khlebnikova NN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnimals, Newborn\r\nAnxiety/chemically induced/*metabolism/physiopathology\r\nDepression/chemically induced/*metabolism/physiopathology\r\nDipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors/*adverse effects/pharmacology\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*pharmacology\r\nFemale\r\n*Lactation\r\nOligopeptides/*adverse effects/pharmacology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nStress, Psychological/chemically induced/metabolism/physiopathology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Krupina NA, and Khlebnikova NN (2016) Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids when administered to lactating rats modify the development of experimental anxiety-depressive state in the rat pups exposed to the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitor diprotin A on the second - third weeks after the birth..

This paper aimed to introduce and outline recent research on epidemiological and intervention studies on lifestyle-related factors in depressive disorder with a special focus on diet. Evidence on exercise, sleep. and related behaviors is also described. Here, findings from meta-analytic studies are emphasized and related studies by the author's research group are introduced. Dietary factors that increase the risk of the illness include energy overload, skipping breakfast, unhealthy diet styles such as Western diet, inflammation-prone diet, and high consumption of ultraprocessed food (UPF). Nutritional imbalances such as inadequate intake of protein, fish (Ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids), vitamins (folate and vitamin D), and minerals (iron and zinc) increases the risk of depression. Poor oral hygiene, food allergy, addiction to alcohol, and smoking constitute risk factors. Sedentary lifestyle and increased screen time (e.g. video games and the internet) confer the risk of depression. Insomnia and disturbed sleep-wake rhythm are also involved in the pathogenesis of depression. There is accumulating evidence at the meta-analysis level for interventions to modify these lifestyle habits in the protection and treatment of depressive disorder. Main biological mechanisms of the link between lifestyle factors and depression include monoamine imbalance, inflammation, altered stress response, oxidative stress, and dysfunction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, although other players such as insulin, leptin, and orexin also play a role. To increase resilience to modern stress and ameliorate depression through modification of lifestyle habits, a list of 30 recommendable interventions is presented.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kunugi H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/pcn.13551 ","Keywords":"depression\r\ndiet\r\nexercise\r\nlifestyle\r\nsleep","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kunugi H (2023) Depression and lifestyle: Focusing on nutrition, exercise, and their possible relevance to molecular mechanisms..

Due to the dynamic progress of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Schizophrenia, Depression, and Multiple Sclerosis (MD), scientists are mobilized to look for new and more effective methods of interventions. A growing body of evidence suggests that inflammatory processes and an imbalance in the composition and function of the gut microbiome, which play a critical role in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases and dietary interventions, such as the Mediterranean diet the DASH diet, or the ketogenic diet can have beneficial effects on their course. The aim of this review was to take a closer look at the role of diet and its ingredients in modulating inflammation associated with the development and/or progression of central nervous system diseases. Presented data shows that consuming a diet abundant in fruits, vegetables, nuts, herbs, spices, and legumes that are sources of anti-inflammatory elements such as omega-3 fatty acids, polyphenols, vitamins, essential minerals, and probiotics while avoiding foods that promote inflammation, create a positive brain environment and is associated with a reduced risk of neurological diseases.

This study investigated the effect of fish oil on neuropsychiatric behaviors, barrier injury, microbiota dysbiosis, and microbiota-derived metabolites in SD rats. The rats subjected to SD had significantly elevated blood levels of corticosteroid and lipopolysaccharides and exhibited anxiety-like behavior in the open field test, depression-like behavior in the forced swim test, and cognitive impairment in the Morris water maize test. We observed that the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines in the SD rats resulted in colonic epithelial barrier injury including a decreased number of goblet cells and increased expression of selected tight junction proteins in the gut and brain. The gut microbiome status revealed a significant decrease in the microbial diversity in the SD rats, especially in probiotics. By contrast, a fish oil-based diet reversed SD-induced behavioral changes and improved the epithelial barrier injury and dysbiosis of the microbiota in the colon. These findings could be attributable to the increase in probiotics and short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) production, improvement in selected intestinal barrier proteins, increase in SCFA receptor expression, and decrease in blood circulation proinflammatory status due to fish oil supplementation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lai WD ; Tung TH ; Teng CY ; Chang CH ; Chen YC ; Huang HY ; Lee HC ; Huang SY ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1039/d2fo00181k ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFish Oils/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology\r\n*Fishes\r\nGastrointestinal Microbiome/drug effects\r\nMaze Learning/drug effects\r\nProbiotics/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\n*Sleep Deprivation\r\nTight Junctions/drug effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lai WD, Tung TH, Teng CY, Chang CH, Chen YC, Huang HY, Lee HC, and Huang SY (2022) Fish oil ameliorates neuropsychiatric behaviors and gut dysbiosis by elevating selected microbiota-derived metabolites and tissue tight junctions in rats under chronic sleep deprivation..

METHOD: A β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) inclusion compound (a-β-CD) was prepared from agarwood essential oil (AEO), and the preparation process was optimized and characterized. The safety of AA in nasal mucosa was evaluated through Bufo gargarizans maxillary mucosa and rat nasal mucosa models. Insomnia animal models were replicated by injecting p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), conducting behavioral tests, and detecting the expression levels of monoamine neurotransmitters (NE and 5-HT) and amino acids (GABA/Glu) in the rat hypothalamus. RESULTS: The optimum inclusion process conditions of β-CD were as follows: the feeding ratio was 0.35:1.40 (g:g), the inclusion temperature was 45 °C, the inclusion time was 2 h, and the ICY% and IEO% were 53.78 ± 2.33% and 62.51 ± 3.21%, respectively. The inclusion ratio, temperature, and time are the three factors that have significant effects on the ICY% and IEO% of a-β-CD. AA presented little damage to the nasal mucosa. AA increased the sleep rate, shortened the sleep latency, and prolonged the sleep time of the rats. The behavioral test results showed that AA could ameliorate depression in insomnia rats to a certain extent. The effect on the expression of monoamine neurotransmitters and amino acids in the hypothalamus of rats showed that AA could significantly reduce NE levels and increase the 5-HT level and GABA/Glu ratio in the hypothalamus of insomnia rats. CONCLUSION: The preparation of a-β-CD from AEO can reduce its irritation, improve its stability, increase its curative effect, and facilitate its storage and transport. AA have certain therapeutic effects on insomnia. The mechanism of their effect on rat sleep may involve regulating the expression levels of monoamine neurotransmitters and amino acids in the hypothalamus.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lai Y ; Hua L ; Yang J ; Xu J ; Chen J ; Zhang S ; Zhu S ; Li J ; Shi S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/molecules28020635 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nRats\r\n*Cyclodextrins\r\nFenclonine/pharmacology\r\ngamma-Aminobutyric Acid/metabolism\r\nNeurotransmitter Agents\r\n*Oils, Volatile/pharmacology/chemistry\r\nSerotonin\r\n*Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/chemically induced/drug therapy\r\nagarwood\r\ninsomnia\r\nnose-to-brain delivery\r\nsupercritical fluid extraction\r\nβ-cyclodextrin","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lai Y, Hua L, Yang J, Xu J, Chen J, Zhang S, Zhu S, Li J, and Shi S (2023) The Effect of Chinese Agarwood Essential Oil with Cyclodextrin Inclusion against PCPA-Induced Insomnia Rats..

Side effects and resistance to antidepressant drugs are the greatest complications during treatment. Based on recent evidence, omega-3 fatty acids may influence vulnerability and outcome in depressive disorders. The aim of this study was to further characterize the omega-3 antidepressant-like effect in rats in terms of its behavioral features in the depression model forced swimming test either alone or in combination with antidepressants fluoxetine or mirtazapine. Ultimately, we prompted to determine the lowest dose at which omega-3 fatty acids and antidepressant drugs may still represent a pharmacological advantage when employed in combined treatments. Chronic diet supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids produced concentration-dependent antidepressant-like effects in the forced swimming test displaying a behavioral profile similar to fluoxetine but different from mirtazapine. Fluoxetine or mirtazapine at antidepressant doses (10 and 20 mg/kg/day, respectively) rendered additive effects in combination with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (720 mg/kg/day). Beneficial effects of combined treatment were also observed at sub-effective doses (1 mg/kg/day) of fluoxetine or mirtazapine, since in combination with omega-3 fatty acids (720 mg/kg/day), antidepressants potentiated omega-3 antidepressant-like effects. The antidepressant-like effects occurred in the absence of changes in brain phospholipid classes. The therapeutic approach of combining omega-3 fatty acids with low ineffective doses of antidepressants might represent benefits in the treatment of depression, especially in patients with depression resistant to conventional treatments and even may contribute to patient compliance by decreasing the magnitude of some antidepressant dose-dependent side effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Laino CH ; Fonseca C ; Sterin-Speziale N ; Slobodianik N ; Reinés A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.08.047 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBody Weight/drug effects\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*pharmacology\r\nFluoxetine/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMianserin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology\r\nMirtazapine\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSwimming\r\nTime Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Laino CH, Fonseca C, Sterin-Speziale N, Slobodianik N, and Reinés A (2010) Potentiation of omega-3 fatty acid antidepressant-like effects with low non-antidepressant doses of fluoxetine and mirtazapine..

Major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are among the most common mental disorders that currently plague numerous countries and have varying incidence rates from 26 percent in America to 4 percent in China. Though some of this difference may be attributable to the manner in which individual healthcare providers diagnose mental disorders, this noticeable distribution can be also explained by studies which show that a lack of certain dietary nutrients contribute to the development of mental disorders. Notably, essential vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids are often deficient in the general population in America and other developed countries; and are exceptionally deficient in patients suffering from mental disorders. Studies have shown that daily supplements of vital nutrients often effectively reduce patients' symptoms. Supplements that contain amino acids also reduce symptoms, because they are converted to neurotransmitters that alleviate depression and other mental disorders. Based on emerging scientific evidence, this form of nutritional supplement treatment may be appropriate for controlling major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and anxiety disorders, eating disorders, attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD), addiction, and autism. The aim of this manuscript is to emphasize which dietary supplements can aid the treatment of the four most common mental disorders currently affecting America and other developed countries: major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Most antidepressants and other prescription drugs cause severe side effects, which usually discourage patients from taking their medications. Such noncompliant patients who have mental disorders are at a higher risk for committing suicide or being institutionalized. One way for psychiatrists to overcome this noncompliance is to educate themselves about alternative or complementary nutritional treatments. Although in the cases of certain nutrients, further research needs to be done to determine the best recommended doses of most nutritional supplements, psychiatrists can recommend doses of dietary supplements based on previous and current efficacious studies and then adjust the doses based on the results obtained.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lakhan SE ; Vieira KF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1475-2891-7-2 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nDiet/*standards\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/*therapy\r\nMinerals/*administration & dosage\r\nNutrition Therapy/*methods\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamins/*administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lakhan SE, and Vieira KF (2008) Nutritional therapies for mental disorders..

We evaluated the effect of omega-3 fatty acids alone as well as compared it with the standard antidepressant therapy with fluoxetine in both acute and chronic studies. In both the studies, rats were divided into 4 groups and subjected to the following drug interventions - Group 1- control: Group 2- fluoxetine in dose of 10 mg/kg subcutaneously 23.5, 5 and 1 h before the test: Group 3- omega-3 fatty acids in dose of 500 mg/kg orally; Group 4- fluoxetine plus omega-3 fatty acids both. In acute study, omega-3 fatty acids were given in single dose 2 h prior to the test while in chronic study omega-3 fatty acids were given daily for a period of 28 days. All animals were subjected to a 15-min pretest followed 24 h later by a 5-min test. A time sampling method was used to score the behavioral activity in each group. The results revealed that in acute study, omega-3 fatty acids do not have any significant effect in forced swimming test. However, in chronic study, omega-3 fatty acids affect the immobility and swimming behavior significantly when compared with control (p < 0.01) without any significant effect on climbing behavior and the efficacy of combination of omega-3 fatty acids and fluoxetine is significantly more than that of fluoxetine alone in changing the behavioral activity of rats in forced swimming test. It leads to the conclusion that omega-3 fatty acids have antidepressant activity per se, and the combination of fluoxetine and omega-3 fatty acids has more antidepressant efficacy than fluoxetine alone in forced swimming test in Wistar rats.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lakhwani L ; Tongia SK ; Pal VS ; Agrawal RP ; Nyati P ; Phadnis P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Analysis of Variance\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nFluoxetine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSwimming","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lakhwani L, Tongia SK, Pal VS, Agrawal RP, Nyati P, and Phadnis P (2007) Omega-3 fatty acids have antidepressant activity in forced swimming test in Wistar rats..

Activating the resolution of inflammation through ω-3 fatty acid supplementation may prove to be a successful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of MDD. Patients with MDD, body mass index >25 kg/m(2), and plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥3 μg/mL (n = 61) were enrolled in a 12-week randomized trial consisting of 4 parallel arms: EPA 1, 2, and 4 g/d, and placebo. The supplement contained EPA and DHA in a 3.9:1 ratio. Depression symptoms were assessed using the IDS-C30 scale. Plasma fatty acids and pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) were measured in 42 study completers at baseline and at the end of treatment by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The response rate (≥50% reduction in IDS-30 score) was higher in the 4 g/d EPA arm than placebo (Cohen d = 0.53). In the 4 g/d EPA arm, responders had significantly greater increases in 18-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (18-HEPE) and 13-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (13-HDHA) than non-responders (p < 0.05). Within the 4 g/d EPA arm, the increase in 18-HEPE was significantly associated with reductions in plasma hs-CRP concentrations (p < 0.05) and IDS-C30 scores (p < 0.01). In summary, response rates were greater among patients with MDD randomized to EPA 4 g/d supplementation and in those who showed a greater ability to activate the synthesis of 18-HEPE. The inverse association of 18-HEPE with both systemic inflammation and symptoms of depression highlights the activation of the resolution of inflammation as a likely mechanism in the treatment of MDD with ω-3 fatty acid supplementation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lamon-Fava S ; Liu M ; Dunlop BW ; Kinkead B ; Schettler PJ ; Felger JC ; Ziegler TR ; Fava M ; Mischoulon D ; Rapaport MH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41386-022-01527-7 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/therapeutic use\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3\r\nInflammation\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nC-Reactive Protein","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lamon-Fava S, Liu M, Dunlop BW, Kinkead B, Schettler PJ, Felger JC, Ziegler TR, Fava M, Mischoulon D, and Rapaport MH (2023) Clinical response to EPA supplementation in patients with major depressive disorder is associated with higher plasma concentrations of pro-resolving lipid mediators..

METHODS: Nutraceutical-focused systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines identified the more commonly studied augmentation strategies for depression. RESULTS: S-adenosylmethionine, l-methylfolate, omega-3 fatty acids, and hydroxyvitamin D have sufficient scientific evidence to support their clinical consideration in the stepped care approach to the management of depression.

Since the synthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) in the fetus and placenta is low, both the maternal LCPUFA status and placental function are critical for their supply to the fetus. Maternal supplementation with DHA up to 1 g/d or 2·7 g n-3 LCPUFA did not have any harmful effect. DHA supplementation in large studies slightly the enhanced length of gestation (by about 2 days), which may increase the birth weight by about 50 g at delivery. However no advice can be given on their general using to avoid preterm deliveries in low or high risk pregnancies. Several studies, but not all, reported improvements of the offspring in some neurodevelopmental tests as a result of DHA supplementation during gestation, or, at least, positive relationships between maternal or cord serum DHA percentages and cognitive skills in young children. The effect seems more evident in children with low DHA proportions, which raises the question of how to identify those mothers who might have a poor DHA status and who could benefit from such supplementation. Most studies on the effects of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy on maternal depression were judged to be of low-to-moderate quality, mainly due to small sample sizes and failure to adhere to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines. In contrast, the effects of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on reducing allergic diseases in offspring are promising.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Larqué E ; Gil-Sánchez A ; Prieto-Sánchez MT ; Koletzko B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S0007114512001481 ","Keywords":"Birth Weight/*drug effects\r\nCognition/*drug effects\r\nDeficiency Diseases/complications/*prevention & control\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/deficiency/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nGestational Age\r\nHumans\r\nHypersensitivity/prevention & control\r\nNervous System/*growth & development\r\nPlacenta\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/*prevention & control\r\n*Pregnancy Outcome\r\n*Prenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Larqué E, Gil-Sánchez A, Prieto-Sánchez MT, and Koletzko B (2012) Omega 3 fatty acids, gestation and pregnancy outcomes..

In the present study we unravel molecular and cellular mechanisms by which nutritional disturbances lead to impaired emotional behaviour in mice. Here we report that nutritional n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) deficiency induces a chronic stress state reflected by disrupted glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated signalling pathway along with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity. This hyperactivity in turn resulted in neuronal atrophy in the dorsolateral (dl)- and dorsomedial (dm)- prefrontal cortex (PFC) and subsequent mood-related behaviour alterations, similarly to chronic social defeat stress. Supplementation of n-3 PUFA prevented detrimental chronic social defeat stress-induced emotional and neuronal impairments by impeding HPA axis hyperactivity. These results indicate a role for dietary n-3 PUFA in the prevention of HPA axis dysfunction associated with the development of some neuropsychiatric disorders including depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Larrieu T ; Hilal ML ; Fourrier C ; De Smedt-Peyrusse V ; Sans N ; Capuron L ; Layé S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/tp.2014.77 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nDepression/*pathology/*physiopathology/psychology\r\n*Disease Models, Animal\r\nDominance-Subordination\r\nEmotions/*physiology\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*physiology\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/pathology/physiopathology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nNeurons/*pathology/*physiology\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System/pathology/physiopathology\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/*pathology/*physiopathology\r\nReceptors, Glucocorticoid/physiology\r\nSignal Transduction/physiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Larrieu T, Hilal ML, Fourrier C, De Smedt-Peyrusse V, Sans N, Capuron L, and Layé S (2014) Nutritional omega-3 modulates neuronal morphology in the prefrontal cortex along with depression-related behaviour through corticosterone secretion..

Among these lipids, the brain is particularly enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) represented by the omega-6 (ω6) and omega-3 (ω3) series. These PUFAs include arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), respectively. PUFAs have received substantial attention as being relevant to many brain diseases, including anxiety and depression. This review addresses an important question in the area of nutritional neuroscience regarding the importance of ω3 PUFAs in the prevention and/or treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases, mainly depression and anxiety. In particular, it focuses on clinical and experimental data linking dietary intake of ω3 PUFAs and depression or anxiety. In particular, we will discuss recent experimental data highlighting how ω3 PUFAs can modulate neurobiological processes involved in the pathophysiology of anxiety and depression. Potential mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective and corrective activity of ω3 PUFAs in the brain are discussed, in particular the sensing activity of free fatty acid receptors and the activity of the PUFAs-derived endocannabinoid system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Larrieu T ; Layé S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fphys.2018.01047 ","Keywords":"DHA\r\nHPA axis\r\nanxiety\r\ndepression\r\nendocannabinoids\r\nmood disorders\r\nnutrient sensing\r\nomega-3 fatty acid","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Larrieu T, and Layé S (2018) Food for Mood: Relevance of Nutritional Omega-3 Fatty Acids for Depression and Anxiety..

Because the basal ganglia are involved in the control of locomotion and emotion, we examined published data regarding the role of n-3 PUFA in dopamine (DA) regulation in the basal ganglia.

This movement has run in parallel with an increased interest in using nutrition modalities as therapeutic measures, as opposed to their conventional role as energy sources. The aim of this manuscript is to provide a basic review of current clinical applications of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, with a particular focus on the latter. METHODS: A selective review of the voluminous literature, including randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, population studies, and case reports, was used to compile data and identify trends in pertinent clinical applications of fatty acid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: There are a myriad of disorders and maladies that seem to benefit from fatty acid supplementation, specifically omega-3 fatty acids. It has clearly been shown that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation provides a protective benefit in heart disease, and in particular sudden cardiac death. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is another disease entity that has been proven to benefit from this nutrition intervention, with improvement in symptoms and diminished nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) usage. In addition, many psychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (MDD), have shown positive results when supplementation has been used as an adjunct to standard pharmacotherapy. The remainder of clinical applications for omega-3 fatty acids requires further investigation. Specifically, according to preliminary clinical evidence, parenteral administration of fatty acids warrants further study.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lee S ; Gura KM ; Kim S ; Arsenault DA ; Bistrian BR ; Puder M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0115426506021004323 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nArthritis, Rheumatoid/*prevention & control\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3/physiology/therapeutic use\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-6/physiology/therapeutic use\r\nHeart Diseases/*prevention & control\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/*prevention & control\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lee S, Gura KM, Kim S, Arsenault DA, Bistrian BR, and Puder M (2006) Current clinical applications of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids..

Thus, the discovery of antidepressive foods is attractive and could have considerable impacts worldwide. We investigated the antidepressant-like effects of Perilla frutescens seed oil on adult male rats subjected to a forced swimming test (FST). Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were housed and fed various diets, including soybean oil-rich, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-rich, and P. frutescens seed oil-rich diets for 6 weeks. After the dietary intervention, animals were tested using an FST and were sacrificed after the test. We analyzed the fatty acid profiles of red blood cells (RBCs) and the brain prefrontal cortex (PFC). Levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), serotonin, and dopamine in the PFC were also determined. After the FST, the imipramine, EPA-rich, and P. frutescens seed oil-rich groups showed significant shorter immobility time and longer struggling time than the control group (p < 0.05). Levels of BDNF in the P. frutescens seed oil-rich group and levels of serotonin in the EPA-rich group were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those of the control group. Moreover, the BDNF concentration in the PFC was significantly positively correlated with the struggling time. However, there were no significant differences in dopamine levels between the intervention groups and the control group. In conclusion, a P. frutescens seed oil-rich diet exhibited antidepressant-like properties through modulation of fatty acid profiles and BDNF expression in the brain during an FST.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lee HC ; Ko HK ; Huang BE ; Chu YH ; Huang SY ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1039/c3fo60717h ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*metabolism\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/*diet therapy/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nPerilla frutescens/*chemistry/metabolism\r\nPlant Oils/*metabolism\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSeeds/chemistry/metabolism\r\nSwimming","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lee HC, Ko HK, Huang BE, Chu YH, and Huang SY (2014) Antidepressant-like effects of Perilla frutescens seed oil during a forced swimming test..

Essential oils (EO) have been in use as therapeutic remedies for centuries against various complaints, but still their effectiveness is being underestimated. In the last decades, a great number of controlled studies have supported efficacy of these volatile secondary plant metabolites for various therapeutic indications. Besides others, EO has antidepressant, anti-obesity, antidiabetic, antifirogenic and antiallergic effects. In this review the pharmacological mechanisms for selected EO are summarised and discussed with the main attention on their impact against public health disorders.

METHOD: Inclusive, double-blind, randomized, controlled, 8-week, parallel-group trial, conducted October 17, 2005 through January 30, 2009 in 8 Canadian academic and psychiatric clinics. Adult outpatients (N = 432) with MDE (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, version 5.0.0, criteria) lasting at least 4 weeks, including 40.3% taking antidepressants at baseline, were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of 1,050 mg/d of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 150 mg/d of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or matched sunflower oil placebo (2% fish oil). The primary outcome was the self-report Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR(30)); the secondary outcome was the clinician-rated Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: The adjusted mean difference between treatment and placebo was 1.32 points (95% CI, -0.20 to 2.84; P = .088) on the IDS-SR(30) and 0.97 points (95% CI, -0.012 to 1.95; P = .053) on the MADRS. Planned subgroup analyses revealed a significant interaction of comorbid anxiety disorders and study group (P = .035). For patients without comorbid anxiety disorders (n = 204), omega-3 supplementation was superior to placebo, with an adjusted mean difference of 3.17 points on the IDS-SR(30) (95% CI, 0.89 to 5.45; P = .007) and 1.93 points (95% CI, 0.50 to 3.36; P = .008) on the MADRS. CONCLUSIONS: In this heterogeneous sample of patients with MDE, there was only a trend toward superiority of omega-3 supplementation over placebo in reducing depressive symptoms.

These deficits occur early and correlate with global cognitive performance, depression and degeneration of olfactory regions in the brain. Despite extensive human studies, there has been little characterization of the olfactory system in models of AD. In order to determine if olfactory structural and/or molecular phenotypes are observed in a model expressing a genetic risk factor for AD, we assessed the olfactory bulb (OB) in APOE4 transgenic mice. A significant decrease in OB weight was observed at 12 months of age in APOE4 mice concurrent with inflammation and decreased NeuN expression. In order to determine if a diet rich in omega-3s may alleviate the olfactory system phenotypes observed, we assessed WT and APOE4 mice on a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) diet. APOE4 mice on a DHA diet did not present with atrophy of the OB, and the alterations in NeuN and IBA-1 expression were alleviated. Furthermore, alterations in caspase mRNA and protein expression in the APOE4 OB were not observed with a DHA diet. Similar to the human AD condition, OB atrophy is an early phenotype in the APOE4 mice and concurrent with inflammation. These data support a link between the structural olfactory brain region atrophy and the olfactory dysfunction observed in AD and suggest that inflammation and cell death pathways may contribute to the olfactory deficits observed. Furthermore, the results suggest that diets enriched in DHA may provide benefit to APOE4 allele carriers.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lessard-Beaudoin M ; M Gonzalez L; AlOtaibi M ; Chouinard-Watkins R ; Plourde M ; Calon F ; Graham RK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/ejn.15472 ","Keywords":"*Alzheimer Disease/complications/genetics\r\nAnimals\r\n*Apolipoprotein E4/genetics\r\nAtrophy\r\nDiet\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/*physiology\r\nMice\r\nMice, Transgenic\r\nOlfaction Disorders/*diet therapy/etiology/genetics\r\n*Olfactory Bulb/growth & development/metabolism/pathology\r\nAPOE4\r\nAlzheimer disease\r\napoptosis\r\ncaspases\r\ndocosahexaenoic acid\r\nmild cognitive impairment\r\nmouse model\r\nolfactory system","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lessard-Beaudoin M, M Gonzalez L, AlOtaibi M, Chouinard-Watkins R, Plourde M, Calon F, and Graham RK (2021) Diet enriched in omega-3 fatty acids alleviates olfactory system deficits in APOE4 transgenic mice..

METHOD: Medline searches and reviews of bibliographies were used to identify relevant articles. Each treatment was reviewed with particular attention paid to empirical support, as well as to potential mechanisms of action that might affect not only depression but also CHD endpoints. RESULTS: Nearly all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of depression treatments have been conducted with non-CHD patients. These studies have provided the most support for psychological treatments, particularly CBT and IPT. Aerobic exercise, SJW, and SAMe also have considerable empirical support in otherwise healthy persons, but SJW may have undesirable side effects for CHD patients. Data for EFAs, CP, and acupuncture are limited; however, the use of aerobic exercise shows considerable promise for cardiac patients. CONCLUSIONS: There are few RCTs of patients with clinical depression and CHD, and those that exist have significant methodological limitations. Nonetheless, there is preliminary evidence that nonpharmacologic treatments are effective for cardiac patients with depression. In terms of reducing depression, the most evidence exists for psychological treatments, particularly CBT and IPT. However, there is little evidence that such treatment would also improve CHD risk factors. Aerobic exercise offers more promise to improve both mental and physical health due to its effect on cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes and thus warrants particular attention in future trials.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lett HS ; Davidson J ; Blumenthal JA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/01.psy.0000163453.24417.97 ","Keywords":"Acupuncture Therapy\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nCoronary Disease/*etiology\r\nDepression/complications/*therapy\r\n*Exercise\r\nFatty Acids, Essential/economics/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nHypericum\r\nPhytotherapy\r\nPicolinic Acids/therapeutic use\r\n*Psychotherapy\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lett HS, Davidson J, and Blumenthal JA (2005) Nonpharmacologic treatments for depression in patients with coronary heart disease..

These data support the involvement of n-3 PUFAs levels in the disease processes underlying depression. In addition, these pre-clinical findings indicate neurobiological mechanisms whereby n-3 PUFAs may contribute to the disease including control of serotonergic and dopaminergic function, modulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus, regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and effects on neuroinflammation.

In the present study, we hypothesized that Era may regulate the central nervous system and may have the potential to antagonize depression and anxiety. Therefore, we investigated the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of Era in animal models in comparison with fluoxetine (Fxt). Fifty mice were randomly divided into 5 groups, and treated with a vehicle (0.3% methyl cellulose, 20mL/kg, p.o.), Era (5, 10, 20mg/kg, p.o.), or Fxt (20mg/kg, p.o.) for 7days. Immobility was used to evaluate depressive-like behavior in the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). Animal activity and exploratory behavior as well as anxiety-like behaviors were measured in open field test (OFT) and elevated plus-maze test (EPMT) in mice. Additionally, serum adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (CORT) levels were determined using the ELISA method, and the total anti-oxidative capacity (T-AOC) was detected by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Our data showed that Era (5, 10, or 20mg/kg) induced a significant reduction in mouse immobility time in the TST and FST compared to the normal control group (vehicle group). The positive control, Fxt (20mg/kg group), also induced a significant change in immobility time in the TST and FST compared to the control (vehicle) group. In the OFT, compared with the control group, Fxt (20mg/kg) and Era (5, 10, or 20mg/kg) did not significantly change the locomotive activity (locomotive time, immobility time, or locomotive distance) in mice, but Fxt (20mg/kg) and Era (10, or 20mg/kg) significantly increased the percentage of time spent and squares visited in the OFT central area. In regards to the EPMT, the data showed that Fxt (20mg/kg) and Era (10, 20mg/kg) significantly increased the ratio of time spent and entries in open arms, but did not significantly change the total locomotive distance (including open arms and closed arms) compared to the control group. Biochemical tests found that after 7days of drug treatment, compared with the control group, ACTH and CORT serum levels in mice were significantly decreased, although T-AOC levels did not significantly change. In conclusion, Era (dose range of 5-20mg/kg) administered orally may alleviate depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice, and the antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects of Era may be related to the regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA).","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Li MM ; Jiang ZE ; Song LY ; Quan ZS ; Yu HL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neulet.2016.12.072 ","Keywords":"Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/blood\r\nAnimals\r\nAnti-Anxiety Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAntioxidants/metabolism\r\nCorticosterone/blood\r\nErucic Acids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nFluoxetine/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*physiology\r\nMale\r\nMaze Learning/drug effects\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System/*physiology\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nStress, Psychological/drug therapy/psychology\r\nAnxiety disorder\r\nDepression\r\nErucamide\r\nHPA axis\r\nMice","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Li MM, Jiang ZE, Song LY, Quan ZS, and Yu HL (2017) Antidepressant and anxiolytic-like behavioral effects of erucamide, a bioactive fatty acid amide, involving the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in mice..

Logistic regression and restricted cubic spline models were performed to examine the association n-3 PUFA intake with depressive symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 3054 women aged 42-52 years were included in the present study. In overall midlife women, n-3 PUFA intake was not significantly associated with depressive symptoms (CES-D score ≥16) after adjustment for potential confounders. In early perimenopausal women, n-3 PUFA intake was inversely associated with depressive symptoms after adjustment for potential confounders. The fully adjusted OR with 95% CI of depressive symptoms were 0.062 (0.009-0.457) in the highest quartile (n-3 PUFAs intake was categorized by quartiles) compared with the lowest quartile for n-3 PUFA intake. Restricted cubic spline analyses showed that n-3 PUFA intake were dose-response inversely associated with depressive symptoms in early perimenopausal women. However, in premenopausal women, no significant association between depressive symptoms and n-3 PUFA intake was observed. LIMITATIONS: This was a cross-sectional study, limiting causal inferences.

Emerging evidence also suggests that n-3 PUFA, which are enriched in fish oil, promote cortical plasticity and connectivity. The present study performed a graph-based connectome analysis to investigate the role of n-3 PUFA in emotion-related network organization in medication-free depressed adolescent bipolar offspring. METHODS: At baseline patients (n = 53) were compared with healthy controls (n = 53), and patients were then randomized to 12-week double-blind treatment with placebo or fish oil. At baseline and endpoint, erythrocyte EPA+DHA levels were measured and fMRI scans (4 Tesla) were obtained while performing a continuous performance task with emotional and neutral distractors (CPT-END). Graph-based analysis was used to characterize topological properties of large-scale brain network organization. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients exhibited lower erythrocyte EPA+DHA levels (p = 0.0001), lower network clustering coefficients (p = 0.029), global efficiency (p = 0.042), and lower node centrality and connectivity strengths in frontal-limbic regions (p<0.05). Compared with placebo, 12-week fish oil supplementation increased erythrocyte EPA+DHA levels (p<0.001), network clustering coefficient (p = 0.005), global (p = 0.047) and local (p = 0.023) efficiency, and node centralities mainly in temporal regions (p<0.05). LIMITATIONS: The duration of fish oil supplementation was relatively short and the sample size was relatively small. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary evidence that abnormalities in emotion-related network organization observed in depressed high-risk youth may be amenable to modification through fish oil supplementation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Li W ; Lei D ; Tallman MJ ; Patino LR ; Gong Q ; Strawn JR ; DelBello MP ; McNamara RK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2021.05.086 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy\r\n*Connectome\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid\r\nEmotions\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3\r\nFish Oils\r\nHumans\r\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\r\nBipolar i disorder\r\nBrain networks\r\nEmotional regulation\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nOmega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Li W, Lei D, Tallman MJ, Patino LR, Gong Q, Strawn JR, DelBello MP, and McNamara RK (2021) Emotion-Related Network Reorganization Following Fish Oil Supplementation in Depressed Bipolar Offspring: An fMRI Graph-Based Connectome Analysis..

However, the effects of SHX on mood disorders are still elusive. This study aimed to investigate the effects of SHX essential oil on stress-induced depression of mice. In an acute stress-induced depression model, mice inhaled vehicle (1% Tween 80) for 10 min or 10% SHX for 10 or 30 min once daily for 12 continuous days. In the chronic mild stress (CMS)-induced depression model, mice were exposed to a 28-d CMS treatment. Tail suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST), sucrose preference test (SPT), open field test (OFT), and novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) test were conducted. In addition, serum levels of angiogenin (ANG), thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays. The results showed that in mice exposed to acute stress, repeated SHX inhalation exerted significant antidepressant and anxiolytic activities, and also reduced the serum levels of ANG, TPO, IL-6, and TNF-α. It also significantly reversed the depressive and anxiety-like behaviors, and reduced the serum levels of ANG and TPO in mice exposed to CMS. This is the first report to show that SHX inhalation could produce significant antidepressant and anxiolytic-like effects. These effects might be mediated by SHX ability to modulate the inflammatory response, and reduce dysfunction of vascular genesis and thrombosis. These results support further exploration for developing SHX inhalation as a novel therapeutic strategy for depression and stress-related disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Liang M ; Du Y ; Li W ; Yin X ; Yang N ; Qie A ; Lebaron TW ; Zhang J ; Chen H ; Shi H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1248/bpb.b18-00082 ","Keywords":"Administration, Inhalation\r\nAnimals\r\nAnti-Anxiety Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDrugs, Chinese Herbal/*chemistry\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred ICR\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nOils, Volatile/chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nStress, Psychological/complications\r\nSuHeXiang\r\nangiogenin\r\nanxiety\r\ndepression\r\nstress\r\nthrombopoietin","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Liang M, Du Y, Li W, Yin X, Yang N, Qie A, Lebaron TW, Zhang J, Chen H, and Shi H (2018) SuHeXiang Essential Oil Inhalation Produces Antidepressant- and Anxiolytic-Like Effects in Adult Mice..

Therefore, there has a huge developing space for the research of new and effective therapeutic drugs to supplement or replace traditional drugs. The essential oil has obvious advantages in the treatment of depression and other emotional diseases, its aromatic odor can directly stimulate the olfactory nerves, and the lipophilic small- molecular compounds can cross the blood-brain barrier easily to play its regulatory role of releasing neurotransmitters and hormones related to depression, or adjusting the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and proinflammatory cytokines. The pathogenesis of depression and the problems in traditional medication were illustrated, the research on the antidepressant effects and mechanism of essential oils in recent years is summarized, and the antidepressant chemical components in plant essential oils are reviewed in this article.

However, clinical trials examining the therapeutic benefit of omega-3 PUFAs in depression showed inconsistent results. The goal of this study is to systematically evaluate the antidepressant efficacy of omega-3 PUFAs by using meta-analytic method. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched from 1966 through August 2006 using the key words (depression OR depressive disorder OR mood disorder) AND (omega-3 OR EPA OR DHA OR poly-unsaturated fatty acid OR fish oil). The search was limited to literature in English and clinical trials. STUDY SELECTION: Ten double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with mood disorders receiving omega-3 PUFAs with the treatment period lasting 4 weeks or longer were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Effect size (ES) of each individual study was derived by computing the standardized mean difference. A random-effects model was used to pool the ESs of all included studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: When pooling the results of 10 included studies (N = 329), we found a significant antidepressant effect of omega-3 PUFAs (ES = 0.61, p = .003). Likewise, omega-3 PUFAs significantly improved depression in patients with clearly defined depression (ES = 0.69, p = .002) or with bipolar disorder (ES = 0.69, p = .0009). The dosage of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) did not change the antidepressant efficacy significantly. However, significant heterogeneity among these studies and publication bias were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Although our meta-analysis showed significant antidepressant efficacy of omega-3 PUFAs, it is still premature to validate this finding due to publication bias and heterogeneity. More large-scale, well-controlled trials are needed to find out the favorable target subjects, therapeutic dose of EPA, and the composition of omega-3 PUFAs in treating depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lin PY ; Su KP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/jcp.v68n0712 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lin PY, and Su KP (2007) A meta-analytic review of double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids..

Although substantial evidence from non-pregnant literature supports the presence of bidirectional interactions between nutrition and stress at various psychological, behavioral, and physiological levels, such interaction effects have not yet been systematically examined in the context of pregnancy. SUMMARY: This paper discusses the multifaceted and multilevel relationship between nutrition and stress. It then reviews the currently available observational and experimental evidence in animals and humans regarding the interplay between maternal psychosocial stress, dietary intake, and nutritional state during pregnancy, and implications for maternal and child health-related outcomes. Key Messages: During pregnancy, maternal psychosocial stress, dietary behavior, and nutritional state likely regulate and counter-regulate one another. Emerging evidence suggests that omega-3 fatty acids may attenuate maternal psychosocial stress, and that high maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index exacerbates unhealthy dietary behaviors under high-stress conditions. Longitudinal studies are warranted in order to understand the interplay between prenatal psychosocial stress, diet, and stress- and nutrition-related biomarkers to obtain further insight and inform the development and design of future, more effective intervention trials for improved maternal and child health outcomes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lindsay KL ; Buss C ; Wadhwa PD ; Entringer S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000457136 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnimals\r\nBody Mass Index\r\nEating\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/physiology\r\nFeeding Behavior\r\nFemale\r\nFetal Development\r\nHumans\r\n*Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nNutritional Status\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/*physiopathology/psychology\r\nPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*physiopathology/*psychology\r\nStress, Psychological/*physiopathology\r\nAnxiety\r\nDepression\r\nDietary intakes\r\nFetal programming\r\nNutrition\r\nPerceived stress\r\nPregnancy\r\nPsychosocial states","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lindsay KL, Buss C, Wadhwa PD, and Entringer S (2017) The Interplay between Maternal Nutrition and Stress during Pregnancy: Issues and Considerations..

Therefore, this study examined the effects of consuming dietary fatty acids on depression, mood, and anxiety. METHODS: In this randomized crossover-design study, 37 university students served as their own controls, consuming each of the following diets for a 4-day period with a 2-week washout period between diets: (1) low fatty acid, (2) high saturated fatty acid (SFA), (3) high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), and (4) control. The order of sessions was counterbalanced across dietary groups. Following consumption of each diet, participants were examined for within-subject differences in depression, mood, and anxiety. Measures included weighed dietary fat intakes, Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety and Depression Scales, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. RESULTS: Participants had significantly higher positive affect scores (p < .007) and were significantly less irritable (p < .04) when they consumed diets rich in SFAs and PUFAs than when they consumed a low fatty acid or control diet. However, depression, anxiety, and negative affect scores did not differ significantly among diets. Analysis of participants' serum lipid levels following their intake of the fatty acid and control diets indicated significantly higher levels of total cholesterol (p = .006) and serum triglycerides (p = .003) with the control diet. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the neurobehavioral benefits of consuming dietary fatty acids among healthy individuals. By concentrating on the positive effects of diet on affective processes, health professionals can also provide support for at-risk individuals.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lindseth G ; Petros T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/1099800416657638 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCholesterol/*blood\r\nDiet/*adverse effects\r\nDietary Fats/*adverse effects\r\nFatty Acids/*adverse effects\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/*adverse effects\r\nFeeding Behavior\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nNervous System Diseases/*chemically induced\r\nanxiety\r\ndepression\r\nfatty acids\r\nmood","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lindseth G, and Petros T (2016) Neurobehavioral Effects of Consuming Dietary Fatty Acids..

Omega-3 (omega-3) PUFA eicosapentaeoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are the most common PUFA in the brain. The physiological roles of omega-3 PUFA in the brain include regulation of cell membrane fluidity, dopaminergic and serotoninergic transmission, membrane-bound enzymes and cellular signal transduction. They are also thought to play a role in brain glucose metabolism, eicosanoid synthesis, gene expression, cell growth and protection from apoptosis. Increasing evidence from animal and human research shows omega-3 PUFA depletion may play an etiological role in several inflammatory, autoimmune and neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular, an association between omega-3 PUFA and depression was repeatedly suggested in observational and experimental studies on populations affected by major depression, depressed mood or post-partum depression. Consistently, the potential therapeutic role of omega-3 PUFA dietary supplementation was tested in clinical trials on depression. The current review identifies and evaluates available epidemiological evidence of a negative relationship between omega-3 PUFA and depression and examines its biological plausibility. Although current evidence increasingly supports an inverse association between omega-3 PUFA and depression, the validity of findings from observational and experimental research is limited by several methodological issues. Further studies with larger sample sizes and more sophisticated design are required to provide convincing evidence of a causal relationship between omega-3 PUFA and depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Liperoti R ; Landi F ; Fusco O ; Bernabei R ; Onder G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/138161209789909683 ","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/*prevention & control\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*pharmacology\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Liperoti R, Landi F, Fusco O, Bernabei R, and Onder G (2009) Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and depression: a review of the evidence..

However, there is little understanding of the cellular mechanisms involved in depression and its comorbid cerebrovascular damage and cognition impairment. Here, we tested the prediction that the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model would manifest in disturbed glymphatic function and that dietary supplementation with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) could ameliorate these deficits while alleviating the depression-associated cognitive decline. METHODS: To test the treatment effects of PUFA or Es on behaviours, we applied the tail suspension, open field, and sucrose preference tests to assess depressive symptoms, and applied the Morris water maze test to assess cognition in groups of control, chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), PUFA, and escitalopram (Es) treatment. We measured the extracellular concentrations of dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) in microdialysates from prefrontal cortex (PFC) by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Glia cells and inflammatory factors were analysed with fluorescent immunochemistry and western blot, respectively. We tested brain vasomotor function with two-photon and laser speckle imaging in vivo, and measured glymphatic system function by two-photon imaging in vivo and fluorescence tracer imaging ex vivo, using awake and anesthetized mice. Besides, we monitored cortical spreading depression by laser speckle imaging system. AQP4 depolarization is analysed by fluorescent immunochemistry and western blot. RESULTS: We confirmed that CUMS elicited depression-like and amnestic symptoms, accompanied by decreased monoamines neurotransmitter concentration in PFC and upregulated neuroinflammation markers. Moreover, CUMS mice showed reduced arterial pulsation and compliance in brain, and exhibited depolarized expression of AQP4, thus indicating glymphatic dysfunction both in awake and anesthetized states. PUFA supplementation rescued depression-like behaviours of CUMS mice, reduced neuroinflammation and cerebrovascular dysfunction, ultimately improved cognitive performance, all of which accompanied by restoring glymphatic system function. In contrast, Es treatment alleviated only the depression-like behavioural symptoms, while showing no effects on glymphatic function and depression-incident cognitive deficits. CONCLUSIONS: The CUMS depression model entails suppression of the glymphatic system. PUFA supplementation rescued most behavioural signs of depression and the associated cognitive dysfunction by restoring the underlying glymphatic system disruption and protecting cerebral vascular function.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Liu X ; Hao J ; Yao E ; Cao J ; Zheng X ; Yao D ; Zhang C ; Li J ; Pan D ; Luo X ; Wang M ; Wang W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.022 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Cognitive Dysfunction/drug therapy\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated\r\n*Glymphatic System\r\nHippocampus\r\nMice\r\nStress, Psychological/complications/drug therapy\r\nCUMS\r\nCognitive function\r\nDepression-like symptom\r\nInflammation\r\nPUFA","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Liu X, Hao J, Yao E, Cao J, Zheng X, Yao D, Zhang C, Li J, Pan D, Luo X, Wang M, and Wang W (2020) Polyunsaturated fatty acid supplement alleviates depression-incident cognitive dysfunction by protecting the cerebrovascular and glymphatic systems..

The present study aims to uncover the effects of high-dietary fiber intake on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced depressive-like behaviors and its underlying mechanism. Female C57BL6/J mice were fed with HFD to establish an antenatal obese model. A high-dietary fiber intake (inulin, 0.037 g/kcal) significantly attenuated cognitive deficits and depressive-like behaviors in the maternal mice after the offspring weaning. High-dietary fiber intake upregulated the expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) and suppressed neuroinflammation. Furthermore, high-dietary fiber intake restructured the gut microbiome and elevated the formation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Correlation analysis indicated that the increase in microbes such as Lactobacillus and S24-7, and SCFAs' levels were positively correlated with behavioral improvements. In conclusion, high-dietary fiber intake is a promising nutritional intervention strategy to prevent antenatal obesity-induced behavioral disorders via a microbiota-gut-brain axis.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Liu Z ; Li L ; Ma S ; Ye J ; Zhang H ; Li Y ; Sair AT ; Pan J ; Liu X ; Li X ; Yan S ; Liu X ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1021/acs.jafc.0c04290 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Depression, Postpartum\r\nDiet, High-Fat/adverse effects\r\nDietary Fiber\r\nFatty Acids, Volatile\r\nFemale\r\n*Gastrointestinal Microbiome\r\nHumans\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nModels, Animal\r\n*Obesity\r\nPregnancy\r\nSCFAs\r\ndietary fiber\r\ngut microbiota\r\nhigh-fat diet\r\npostpartum depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Liu Z, Li L, Ma S, Ye J, Zhang H, Li Y, Sair AT, Pan J, Liu X, Li X, Yan S, and Liu X (2020) High-Dietary Fiber Intake Alleviates Antenatal Obesity-Induced Postpartum Depression: Roles of Gut Microbiota and Microbial Metabolite Short-chain Fatty Acid Involved..

Zhi-Zi-Chi decoctions (ZZCD), as a classic oral formula in clinic, is widely applied in depression treatment nowadays. However, the underlying mechanism in the antidepressant activity of ZZCD remains unknown. A classic depression model of chronic mild unpredictable stress (CUMS) was established in rats based on the results of behavioral tests and hippocampal histomorphology. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis indicated that ZZCD could increase short-chain fatty acid-producing and anti-inflammatory bacteria and reduce inflammatory and tryptophan-metabolizing bacteria. Furthermore, ZZCD reversed the alterations of BDNF, TNF-α, pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotransmitters in the gut, blood and brain along the brain-gut axis and restored the decrease of butyrate in cecal content caused by CUMS. Then, butyrate was utilized to validate its ameliorative effect on pathological characteristics of depressive rats. Taken together, these results show that ZZCD exhibits antidepressant effect through modulating gut microbiota to facilitate the production of butyrate, which further regulate anti-inflammation, neurotransmitters, endocrine and BDNF along the gut-brain axis. Hence, this study fills the gap of the antidepressive mechanism of ZZCD in the light of the brain-gut axis and established a multi-targets and multi-levels platform eventually for further research into the mechanism of other TCM efficacy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Liu J ; Fang Y ; Cui L ; Wang Z ; Luo Y ; Gao C ; Ge W ; Huang T ; Wen J ; Zhou T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopha.2022.112861 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor\r\nBrain-Gut Axis\r\n*Butyrates/pharmacology\r\nDepression/metabolism\r\n*Drugs, Chinese Herbal\r\nRNA, Ribosomal, 16S\r\nRats\r\nStress, Psychological/metabolism\r\nAnti-depression\r\nBrain-gut axis\r\nButyrate\r\nChronic unpredictable mild stress\r\nGut microbiota\r\nZhi-Zi-Chi decoction","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Liu J, Fang Y, Cui L, Wang Z, Luo Y, Gao C, Ge W, Huang T, Wen J, and Zhou T (2022) Butyrate emerges as a crucial effector of Zhi-Zi-Chi decoctions to ameliorate depression via multiple pathways of brain-gut axis..

Additionally, arachidonic acid and omega-3 fatty acids have opposing effects on inflammatory signaling. Exogenous administration of the inflammatory cytokine interferon-alpha (IFN-α) can trigger a depressive episode in a subset of vulnerable people, though associated risk factors remain poorly understood. Using a within-subject prospective design of 138 subjects, we examined whether baseline long-chain omega-3 (docosahexaenoic acid - DHA; eicosapentaenoic acid - EPA) and omega-6 (arachidonic acid - AA; di-homo-gamma-linolenic acid - DGLA) fatty acid status was associated with depression vulnerability in hepatitis C patients treated with IFN-α. Based on the literature, we had specific a priori interest in the AA/EPA+DHA ratio. Lower baseline DHA predicted depression incidence (p=0.04), as did elevated DGLA (p=0.02) and an elevated AA/EPA+DHA ratio (p=0.007). The AA/EPA+DHA ratio predicted depression even when controlling for other critical variables such as sleep quality and race. A higher AA/EPA+DHA ratio was positively associated with both increasing Montgomery-Asperg Depression Rating Scores over time (F=4.0; p<0.05) as well as interleukin-6 levels (F=107.4; p<0.05) but not C-reactive protein. Importantly, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid status was not associated with sustained viral response to IFN-α treatment. These prospective data support the role of fatty acid status in depression vulnerability and indicate a potential role for omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention of inflammation-induced depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lotrich FE ; Sears B ; McNamara RK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbi.2012.08.007 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nArachidonic Acid/*blood\r\nC-Reactive Protein/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/blood/*etiology\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*blood\r\nFemale\r\nHepatitis C/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nInflammation/blood\r\nInterferon-alpha/*adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nInterleukin-6/*blood\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lotrich FE, Sears B, and McNamara RK (2013) Elevated ratio of arachidonic acid to long-chain omega-3 fatty acids predicts depression development following interferon-alpha treatment: relationship with interleukin-6..

In the present study we prospectively investigated interactions among poor sleep quality, high-stress, pre-existing depressive symptoms, and polyunsaturated fatty acid status. Non-depressed hepatitis C patients (n=104) were followed prospectively during IFN-α therapy. IFN-MDD occurs in 20-40% of patients and was diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview of DSM-IV (SCID-IV), with incidence examined using Cox regression. Baseline Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and a range of plasma long-chain fatty acid levels were measured (gas chromatography) - focusing on the ratio of arachidonic acid (AA) to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (AA/EPA+DHA). The AA/EPA+DHA ratio (Β=0.40 ± 0.16; p=0.006), PSQI (Β=0.12 ± 0.04; p=0.001), PSS (Β=0.07 ± 0.02; p<0.001), and baseline BDI (Β=0.05 ± 0.02; p<0.001) each individually predicted IFN-MDD incidence. In step-wise Cox regression eliminating non-significant variables, two interactions remained significantly predictive: PSQI*AA/EPA+DHA (p=0.008) and PSS*AA/EPA+DHA (p=0.01). Receiver Operator Curves (ROC) were used to examine the specificity and sensitivity of IFN-MDD prediction. When sleep was normal (PSQI<5), AA/EPA+DHA was strongly predictive of IFN-MDD (AUC=91 ± 6; p=0.002). For example, among those with AA/EPA+DHA less than the median (4.15), none with PSQI<5 developed depression. Conversely, neither PSS nor PSQI was statistically associated with depression risk in those with an elevated AA/EPA+DHA ratio. These data demonstrate that the AA/EPA+DHA ratio moderates the effect of poor sleep on risk for developing IFN-MDD and may have broader implications for predicting and preventing MDD associated with inflammation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lotrich FE ; Sears B ; McNamara RK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.plefa.2015.10.004 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nDepression/*chemically induced/epidemiology\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/*blood\r\nFemale\r\nHepatitis C/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nHumans\r\nInterferon-alpha/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nProportional Hazards Models\r\nProspective Studies\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSleep Deprivation/blood/*complications\r\nYoung Adult\r\nArachidonic acid\r\nDocosahexaenoic acid\r\nEicosapentaenoic acid\r\nInterferon-alpha\r\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nSleep quality","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lotrich FE, Sears B, and McNamara RK (2016) Polyunsaturated fatty acids moderate the effect of poor sleep on depression risk..

Here, we synthesise this evidence, including findings from large meta-analyses showing cross-sectional and prospective associations between diet quality and mental health, even following adjustment for relevant confounding factors. Potential mechanistic pathways underpinning these associations include those of the gut-brain axis, demonstrated mostly in animal models. Dietary fibre is an important component of healthy diet and may be relevant for common mental disorders, with some studies showing a dose-dependent relationship between fibre intake and risk of depression. The potential contribution of nutraceuticals is also discussed, such as omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and psychobiotics. We consider the relevance of special diets such as the ketogenic diet and food sensitivities in the management of severe mental illness (e.g., anorexia nervosa) and brain disease (e.g., Alzheimer's disease). Given the relatively early nature of research in nutritional psychiatry, there remain a number of challenges to its translation into clinical practice. These span individual, clinical, and societal domains. We conclude with a discussion of micro- and macroeconomic factors which may be considered in the successful application of nutritional psychiatry research to improve public health.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Loughman A ; Staudacher HM ; Rocks T ; Ruusunen A ; Marx W ; O Apos Neil A; Jacka FN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000510422 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nDiet/*psychology\r\nDietary Fiber\r\nDietary Supplements\r\n*Feeding Behavior/physiology/psychology\r\nHumans\r\n*Mental Health\r\n*Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nPsychiatry/trends\r\nPsychophysiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Loughman A, Staudacher HM, Rocks T, Ruusunen A, Marx W, O Apos Neil A, and Jacka FN (2021) Diet and Mental Health..

Studies suggest that omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids may help alleviate depression. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare enriched ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) supplementation with placebo for the treatment of PD and depressive symptoms in middle-aged women. DESIGN: Women with moderate-to-severe PD (n = 120) were randomly assigned to receive 1.05 g E-EPA/d plus 0.15 g ethyl-docosahexaenoic acid/d (n = 59) or placebo (n = 61) for 8 wk. The main outcomes were 8-wk changes in PD scores [Psychological General Well-Being Schedule (PGWB)] and depressive scales [20-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist Depression Scale (HSCL-D-20) and the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-21)]. RESULTS: At baseline, women with PD were mildly to moderately depressed, and 24% met the major depressive episode (MDE) criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition. After 8 wk, outcomes improved in both groups, but no significant differences were noted between them. Stratification analyses for MDE diagnosis at baseline indicated that differences in adjusted 8-wk changes between the E-EPA group without MDE (n = 46) and the placebo group (n = 45) were 8.0 (95% CI: 0.6, 15.3; P = 0.034) for the PGWB, -0.2 (95% CI: -0.01, -0.4; P = 0.040) for the HSCL-D-20, and -2.7 (95% CI: -0.3, -5.1; P = 0.030) for the HAM-D-21. Differences in adjusted 8-wk changes between the E-EPA group with MDE (n = 13) and the placebo group (n = 16) were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first trial of n-3 supplementation in the treatment of PD and depressive symptoms in middle-aged women. In women with PD without MDE at baseline, the 8-wk changes in PD and depressive scales improved significantly more with E-EPA than with placebo.

METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exploring the efficacy of n-3 PUFA supplementation for patients with MDD were retrieved from the databases of Pubmed, Embase and the Cochrane Library. RCTs comparing the efficacy of n-3 PUFA for adult (≥18 years) MDD patients without comorbidity were eligible for our study. The score of depressive symptoms in early therapy period of the treatment (≤9 weeks) was extracted. Standardized mean deviations (SMDs) of all the sores from the eligible RCTs were synthesized in a pairwise meta-analysis in frequentist framework and a random-effects network meta-analysis in Bayesian framework for the overall and subgroups (high- and low-dose) efficacy of n-3 PUFAs. RESULTS: A total of 910 MDD patients in 10 trials with 3 adjuvant therapy strategies (high-dose n-3 PUFAs, low-dose n-3 PUFAs and placebo) were included. Results of pairwise meta-analysis showed that n-3 PUFAs were superior to placebo (SMD: 1.243 ± 0.596; 95% CI: 0.060 ~ 2.414). Results of the network meta-analysis showed that both the high (SMD: 0.908 ± 0.331; 95% CI: 0.262 ~ 1.581) and the low-dose (SMD: 0.601 ± 0.286; 95% CI: 0.034 ~ 1.18) n-3 PUFAs were superior to placebo, and the efficacy of high-dose n-3 PUFAs is superior to that of low-dose. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose n-3 PUFAs supplementation might be more superior than low-dose in the early therapy period for MDD. More head-to-head clinical trials need to be carried out to provide more direct comparison and enhance the evidence of the efficacy of n-3PUFAs for MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Luo XD ; Feng JS ; Yang Z ; Huang QT ; Lin JD ; Yang B ; Su KP ; Pan JY ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12888-020-02656-3 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated\r\nHumans\r\nNetwork Meta-Analysis\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nNetwork meta-analysis\r\nOmega-3\r\nPolyunsaturated fatty acid\r\nSupplementation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Luo XD, Feng JS, Yang Z, Huang QT, Lin JD, Yang B, Su KP, and Pan JY (2020) High-dose omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation might be more superior than low-dose for major depressive disorder in early therapy period: a network meta-analysis..

Whether omega-3 supplementation alters the stress responsivity of telomerase, cortisol, and inflammation is unknown. This randomized, controlled trial examined the impact of omega-3 supplementation on cellular aging-related biomarkers following a laboratory speech stressor. In total, 138 sedentary, overweight, middle-aged participants (n = 93 women, n = 45 men) received either 2.5 g/d of omega-3, 1.25 g/d of omega-3, or a placebo for 4 months. Before and after the trial, participants underwent the Trier Social Stress Test. Saliva and blood samples were collected once before and repeatedly after the stressor to measure salivary cortisol, telomerase in peripheral blood lymphocytes, and serum anti-inflammatory (interleukin-10; IL-10) and pro-inflammatory (interleukin-6; IL-6, interleukin-12, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) cytokines. Adjusting for pre-supplementation reactivity, age, sagittal abdominal diameter, and sex, omega-3 supplementation altered telomerase (p = 0.05) and IL-10 (p = 0.05) stress reactivity; both supplementation groups were protected from the placebo group's 24% and 26% post-stress declines in the geometric means of telomerase and IL-10, respectively. Omega-3 also reduced overall cortisol (p = 0.03) and IL-6 (p = 0.03) throughout the stressor; the 2.5 g/d group had 19% and 33% lower overall cortisol levels and IL-6 geometric mean levels, respectively, compared to the placebo group. By lowering overall inflammation and cortisol levels during stress and boosting repair mechanisms during recovery, omega-3 may slow accelerated aging and reduce depression risk.

We assessed the effect on cognition of a nutritional intervention using MedDiets in comparison with a low-fat control diet. METHODS: We assessed 522 participants at high vascular risk (44.6% men, age 74.6 ± 5.7 years at cognitive evaluation) enrolled in a multicentre, randomised, primary prevention trial (PREDIMED), after a nutritional intervention comparing two MedDiets (supplemented with either extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) or mixed nuts) versus a low-fat control diet. Global cognitive performance was examined by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clock Drawing Test (CDT) after 6.5 years of nutritional intervention. Researchers who assessed the outcome were blinded to group assignment. We used general linear models to control for potential confounding. RESULTS: After adjustment for sex, age, education, Apolipoprotein E genotype, family history of cognitive impairment/dementia, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, alcohol and total energy intake, participants allocated to the MedDiet+EVOO showed higher mean MMSE and CDT scores with significant differences versus control (adjusted differences: +0.62 95% CI +0.18 to +1.05, p=0.005 for MMSE, and +0.51 95% CI +0.20 to +0.82, p=0.001 for CDT). The adjusted means of MMSE and CDT scores were also higher for participants allocated to the MedDiet+Nuts versus control (adjusted differences: +0.57 (95% CI +0.11 to +1.03), p=0.015 for MMSE and +0.33 (95% CI +0.003 to +0.67), p=0.048 for CDT). These results did not differ after controlling for incident depression.

However, the results of randomized controlled trials are mixed and controversy exists as to whether either eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or both are responsible for the reported benefits. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to provide an updated meta-analysis of all double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trials examining the effect of omega3 LC-PUFA supplementation in which depressive symptoms were a reported outcome. The study also aimed to specifically test the differential effectiveness of EPA versus DHA through meta-regression and subgroup analyses. DESIGN: Studies were selected using the PubMed database on the basis of the following criteria: (1) randomized design; (2) placebo controlled; (3) use of an omega3 LC-PUFA preparation containing DHA, EPA, or both where the relative amounts of each fatty acid could be quantified; and (4) reporting sufficient statistics on scores of a recognizable measure of depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-one studies were identified, of which 28 met the above inclusion criteria and were therefore included in the subsequent meta-analysis. Using a random effects model, overall standardized mean depression scores were reduced in response to omega3 LC-PUFA supplementation as compared with placebo (standardized mean difference = -0.291, 95% CI = -0.463 to -0.120, z = -3.327, p = 0.001). However, significant heterogeneity and evidence of publication bias were present. Meta-regression studies showed a significant effect of higher levels of baseline depression and lower supplement DHAEPA ratio on therapeutic efficacy. Subgroup analyses showed significant effects for: (1) diagnostic category (bipolar disorder and major depression showing significant improvement with omega3 LC-PUFA supplementation versus mild-to-moderate depression, chronic fatigue and non-clinical populations not showing significant improvement); (2) therapeutic as opposed to preventive intervention; (3) adjunctive treatment as opposed to monotherapy; and (4) supplement type. Symptoms of depression were not significantly reduced in 3 studies using pure DHA (standardized mean difference 0.001, 95% CI -0.330 to 0.332, z = 0.004, p = 0.997) or in 4 studies using supplements containing greater than 50% DHA (standardized mean difference = 0.141, 95% CI = -0.195 to 0.477, z = 0.821, p = 0.417). In contrast, symptoms of depression were significantly reduced in 13 studies using supplements containing greater than 50% EPA (standardized mean difference = -0.446, 95% CI = -0.753 to -0.138, z = -2.843, p = 0.005) and in 8 studies using pure ethyl-EPA (standardized mean difference = -0.396, 95% CI = -0.650 to -0.141, z = -3.051, p = 0.002). However, further meta-regression studies showed significant inverse associations between efficacy and study methodological quality, study sample size, and duration, thus limiting the confidence of these findings. CONCLUSIONS: The current meta-analysis provides evidence that EPA may be more efficacious than DHA in treating depression. However, owing to the identified limitations of the included studies, larger, well-designed, randomized controlled trials of sufficient duration are needed to confirm these findings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Martins JG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/07315724.2009.10719785 ","Keywords":"Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/*therapeutic use\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Martins JG (2009) EPA but not DHA appears to be responsible for the efficacy of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in depression: evidence from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials..

We investigated the antidepressant effects of n-3 fatty acids (n-3FAs) monotherapy (without conventional antidepressants) for T2DM patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms. METHODS: A 10-wk, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group (1:1 ratio) randomized trial of n-3FAs (2700 mg/day EPA: DHA ratio=2) versus placebo in 88 Iranian diabetic patients with mild to moderate depression based on Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II-PERSIAN) was conducted. This study started from July 2014 to January 2015 in Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. The primary event was defined as worsened, non-changed, or inconsiderably improved depression (<5 unit decrease in BDI-II-PERSIAN depression scores after treatment) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02261545). RESULTS: Randomly, 44 T2DM patients were treated with n-3FAs supplements and 44 cases received placebo (three patients discontinued). n-3FAs could significantly protect patients against the aforesaid event and exhibit satisfactory prevention (number needed to treat with 95% confidence interval: 2.52, 1.71-4.74). No serious adverse reactions were reported. CONCLUSION: n-3FAs supplementation had significant antidepressant effects in T2DM patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms, not confounded by metabolic factors and disease duration.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mazaherioun M ; Saedisomeolia A ; Javanbakht MH ; Koohdani F ; Zarei M ; Ansari S ; Khoshkhoo Bazargani F; Djalali M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Depression\r\nRandomized controlled trial\r\nType 2 diabetes mellitus\r\nn-3 fatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mazaherioun M, Saedisomeolia A, Javanbakht MH, Koohdani F, Zarei M, Ansari S, Khoshkhoo Bazargani F, and Djalali M (2018) Long Chain n-3 Fatty Acids Improve Depression Syndrome in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus..

N-3 PUFA can mitigate oxidative stress, which is common in CAD and may contribute to depressive symptoms. This study investigated whether greater pre-treatment oxidative stress, measured by the ratios of late-stage lipid peroxidation markers (malondialdehyde [MDA], 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal [4-HNE], and 8-isoprostane [8-ISO]) to an early-stage marker (lipid hydroperoxides [LPH]), predicted n-3 PUFA antidepressant benefits in CAD. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of CAROTID (CAD Randomized Omega-3 Trial in Depression, NCT00981383). Patient demographics and medical characteristics were collected. Depressive symptoms were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Patients were then randomized to receive either 1.9g/day n-3 PUFA or placebo for 12weeks, after which HAM-D scores were reassessed. Baseline LPH, 4-HNE, 8-ISO, MDA and n-3 PUFA concentrations were analysed from fasting blood. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients (age=61.1±8.5, 76% male, HAM-D=7.5±6.1) were included (n=45 placebo, n=34 n-3 PUFA). In the n-3 PUFA group, higher baseline ratios of MDA/LPH (primary analysis: F(1,33)=6.20, beta=-0.35, p=0.018), 4-HNE/LPH (exploratory analysis: F(1,33)=5.35, beta=-0.32, p=0.027), and 8-ISO/LPH (exploratory analysis: F(1,33)=6.10, beta=-0.33, p=0.019), indicating higher oxidative stress, were associated with greater depressive symptom improvement. In each model, higher baseline EPA+DHA concentrations independently predicted depressive symptom improvement with n-3 PUFA (MDA/LPH: F(1,33)=11.05, p=0.002; 4-HNE/LPH: F(1,33)=11.36, p=0.002; 8-ISO/LPH: F(1,33)=13.15, p=0.001). No associations were observed in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: n-3 PUFA may be more likely to improve depressive symptoms in CAD patients with pre-treatment evidence of oxidative stress.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mazereeuw G ; Herrmann N ; Andreazza AC ; Scola G ; Ma DWL ; Oh PI ; Lanctôt KL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbi.2016.10.005 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBiomarkers/blood\r\nCoronary Artery Disease/*blood/drug therapy\r\nDepression/*blood\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*blood\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nOxidative Stress/*physiology\r\nCardiovascular\r\nCoronary artery disease\r\nDHA\r\nDepression\r\nDocosahexaenoic acid\r\nEPA\r\nEicosapentaenoic acid\r\nFish oil\r\nHeart disease\r\nHydroperoxide\r\nHydroxynonenal\r\nIsoprostane\r\nLipid peroxidation\r\nMalondialdehyde\r\nMood\r\nOmega-3 fatty acid\r\nOxidative stress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mazereeuw G, Herrmann N, Andreazza AC, Scola G, Ma DWL, Oh PI, and Lanctôt KL (2017) Oxidative stress predicts depressive symptom changes with omega-3 fatty acid treatment in coronary artery disease patients..

Dietary supplementation to manage stress is widespread despite limited supporting evidence. A systematic review of the available literature was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of specific dietary supplements in managing female stress and anxiety. OBJECTIVES: To identify the impact of essential fatty acids (EFAs), B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium and/or zinc, consumed as dietary supplements to the daily diet, on female stress and anxiety levels. INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 18 years and over, who had participated in a study where stress and/or anxiety were assessed. TYPES OF INTERVENTION(S): Dietary supplementation with EFAs, B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium and/or zinc. TYPES OF COMPARATORS: Supplements, either alone or combined, were compared with either no intervention or placebo. TYPES OF STUDIES: Randomized controlled and pseudo-randomized trials were included. OUTCOMES: Stress and anxiety were assessed using self-report or physiological outcome measures. SEARCH STRATEGY: Published and unpublished studies were sought via MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MedNar, National Institute of Mental Health and the International Association for Women's Mental Health. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Methodological quality was evaluated using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted using the standardized data extraction instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA SYNTHESIS: Due to heterogeneity of the included studies, narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in this review. Essential fatty acids were effective in reducing perceived stress and salivary cortisol levels during pregnancy and anxiety in premenstrual women, and anxiety during menopause in the absence of depression, but were ineffective when depression was disregarded. Disregarding the hormonal phase, EFAs were ineffective in reducing stress or anxiety in four groups of women. Combined magnesium and vitamin B6 supplementation reduced premenstrual anxiety but had no effect when used in isolation and did not affect stress in women suffering from dysmenorrhea when combined or used in isolation. Older women experienced anxiety reduction using vitamin B6, but not folate or vitamin B12. High-dose sustained-release vitamin C was effective in reducing anxiety and blood pressure in response to stress. CONCLUSION: The current review suggests that EFAs may be effective in reducing prenatal stress and salivary cortisol and may reduce anxiety during premenstrual syndrome and during menopause in the absence of depression. Magnesium and vitamin B6 may be effective in combination in reducing premenstrual stress, and vitamin B6 alone may reduce anxiety effectively in older women. High-dose sustained-release vitamin C may reduce anxiety and mitigate increased blood pressure in response to stress. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Essential fatty acids may be effective in reducing prenatal stress and salivary cortisol levels, and premenstrual or menopausal anxiety in the absence of depression. Combining magnesium and vitamin B6 may reduce premenstrual anxiety and vitamin B6 may reduce anxiety in older women. High-dose sustained-release vitamin C may reduce anxiety and mitigate increased blood pressure in response to stress. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Investigating supplementation in longer term studies is warranted and should include compliance testing, the use of inert substances as controls and reliable outcome measures.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McCabe D ; Lisy K ; Lockwood C ; Colbeck M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.11124/JBISRIR-2016-002965 ","Keywords":"Ascorbic Acid/*administration & dosage\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Essential/*administration & dosage\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMagnesium/administration & dosage\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nStress, Psychological/*psychology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamin B Complex/*administration & dosage\r\nZinc/administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McCabe D, Lisy K, Lockwood C, and Colbeck M (2017) The impact of essential fatty acid, B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium and zinc supplementation on stress levels in women: a systematic review..

In primates and humans, preterm delivery is associated with deficits in fetal cortical DHA accrual, and children/adolescents born preterm exhibit deficits in cortical gray matter maturation, neurocognitive deficits particularly in the realm of attention, and increased risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia. Individuals diagnosed with ADHD or schizophrenia exhibit deficits in cortical gray matter maturation, and medications found to be efficacious in the treatment of these disorders increase cortical and striatal dopamine neurotransmission. These associations in conjunction with intervention trials showing enhanced cortical visual acuity and cognitive outcomes in preterm and term infants fed DHA, suggest that perinatal deficits in brain DHA accrual may represent a preventable neurodevelopmental risk factor for the subsequent emergence of psychopathology.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McNamara RK ; Carlson SE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.plefa.2006.07.010 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBehavior\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nBrain/*growth & development/*physiology\r\nBrain Chemistry\r\nCognition\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/analysis\r\nFatty Acids/analysis\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*physiology\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/deficiency\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/*etiology/*prevention & control\r\nPregnancy\r\nPrenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nPrimates/anatomy & histology/growth & development/physiology\r\nRodentia\r\nSynaptic Transmission","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McNamara RK, and Carlson SE (2006) Role of omega-3 fatty acids in brain development and function: potential implications for the pathogenesis and prevention of psychopathology..

This hypothesis is supported by cross-national and cross-sectional epidemiological surveys finding an inverse correlation between n-3 fatty acid status and prevalence rates of both CHD and MDD, prospective studies finding that lower dietary or membrane EPA+DHA levels increase risk for both MDD and CHD, case-control studies finding that the n-3 fatty acid status of MDD patients places them at high risk for emergent CHD morbidity and mortality, meta-analyses of controlled n-3 fatty acid intervention studies finding significant advantage over placebo for reducing depression symptom severity in MDD patients, and for secondary prevention of cardiac events in CHD patients, findings that n-3 fatty acid status is inversely correlated with other documented CHD risk factors, and patients diagnosed with MDD after ACS exhibit significantly lower n-3 fatty acid status compared with nondepressed ACS patients. This body of evidence provides strong support for future studies to evaluate the effects of increasing dietary n-3 fatty acid status on CHD comorbidity and mortality in MDD patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McNamara RK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1155/2009/362795 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McNamara RK (2009) Membrane omega-3 Fatty Acid deficiency as a preventable risk factor for comorbid coronary heart disease in major depressive disorder..

Limited efficacy and adverse side-effects associated with psychotropic medications used in the treatment of MDD and BD highlight the urgent need to develop safe and efficacious treatments or treatment adjuncts. A body of evidence now indicates that long-chain omega-3 (LCn-3) fatty acid deficiency is a feature associated with MDD and BD. The etiology of LCn-3 deficits in MDD and BD patients may be attributable to both genetic and environmental factors. Dietary LCn-3 supplementation is safe and well-tolerated with chronic administration and corrects LCn-3 deficiency in MDD and BD patients. LCn-3 supplementation has been found to augment the therapeutic efficacy of psychotropic medications in the treatment of mood symptoms and to reduce suicidality. Preliminary studies also suggest that LCn-3 supplementation is efficacious as monotherapy in the treatment and prevention of psychopathology in children and adolescents. LCn-3 supplementation is also associated with reduced risk for developing coronary heart disease. The overall cost-benefit ratio associated with LCn-3 supplementation provides a strong rationale to diagnose and treat LCn-3 deficiency in MDD and BD patients, and to prevent LCn-3 deficiency in subjects at high risk for developing these disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McNamara RK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1570163811310030006 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nDeficiency Diseases/drug therapy/*metabolism/prevention & control\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*metabolism/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMood Disorders/*metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McNamara RK (2013) Long-chain omega-3 fatty acid deficiency in mood disorders: rationale for treatment and prevention..

An accumulating body of evidence has implicated deficits in the dietary essential long-chain omega-3 (LCn-3) fatty acids, eicosapenaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the pathophysiology of several major psychiatric disorders. LCn-3 fatty acids have an established long-term safety record in the general population, and existing evidence suggests that increasing LCn-3 fatty acid status may reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. LCn-3 fatty acid supplementation has been shown to augment the therapeutic efficacy of antidepressant, mood-stabilizer, and second generation antipsychotic medications, and may additionally mitigate adverse cardiometabolic side-effects. Preliminary evidence also suggests that LCn-3 fatty acid supplementation may be efficacious as monotherapy for primary and early secondary prevention and for perinatal symptoms. The overall cost-benefit ratio endorses the incorporation of LCn-3 fatty acids into psychiatric treatment algorithms. The recent availability of laboratory facilities that specialize in determining blood LCn-3 fatty acid status and emerging evidence-based consensus guidelines regarding safe and efficacious LCn-3 fatty acid dose ranges provide the infrastructure necessary for implementation. This article outlines the rationale for incorporating LCn-3 fatty acid treatment into psychiatric practice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McNamara RK ; Strawn JR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.phanu.2012.10.004 ","Keywords":"ADHD\r\nAnxiety\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nCardiovascular disease\r\nClinical staging\r\nDocosahexaenoic acid (DHA)\r\nEicosapenaenoic acid (EPA)\r\nLong-chain omega-3 fatty acids\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nPrimary prevention\r\nSchizophrenia\r\nSuicide","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McNamara RK, and Strawn JR (2013) Role of Long-Chain Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Psychiatric Practice..

METHODS: Metabolite concentrations were determined by (1)H MRS in the anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of adolescents with MDD before and following 10-week open-label supplementation with low (2.4 g/day, n = 7) or high (16.2 g/day, n = 7) dose FO. Depressive symptom severity scores and erythrocyte fatty acid levels were also determined. RESULTS: Baseline erythrocyte eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) composition was positively correlated, and arachidonic acid (AA) and the AA/EPA ratio were inversely correlated, with choline (Cho) concentrations in the right DLPFC. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) composition was inversely correlated with myo-inositol (mI) concentrations in the left DLPFC. Erythrocyte EPA and DHA composition increased, and AA decreased, significantly following low-dose and high-dose FO supplementation. In the intent-to-treat sample, depressive symptom severity scores decreased significantly in the high-dose group (-40%, P < 0.0001) and there was a trend in the low-dose group (-20%, P = 0.06). There were no significant baseline-endpoint changes in metabolite levels in each voxel. In the low-dose group there were changes with large effect sizes, including a decrease in mI in the left DLPFC (-12%, P = 0.18, d = 0.8) and increases in glutamate + glutamine (Glx) (+12%, P = 0.19, d = 0.8) and Cho (+15%, P = 0.08, d = 1.2) in the right DLPFC. In the high-dose group, there was a trend for increases in Cho in the right DLPFC (+10%, P = 0.09, d = 1.2). DISCUSSION: These preliminary data suggest that increasing the LCn-3 fatty acid status of adolescent MDD patients is associated with subtle changes in Glx, mI, and Cho concentrations in the DLPFC that warrant further evaluation in a larger controlled trial.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McNamara RK ; Jandacek R ; Rider T ; Tso P ; Chu WJ ; Weber WA ; Welge JA ; Strawn JR ; Adler CM ; DelBello MP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1179/1476830514Y.0000000135 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\n*Adolescent Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nAdult\r\nChild\r\nChild Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nDeficiency Diseases/*diet therapy/metabolism/physiopathology/psychology\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnostic imaging/etiology/metabolism/*prevention & \r\n      control\r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Essential/deficiency/metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nFish Oils/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nGyrus Cinguli/diagnostic imaging/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nIntention to Treat Analysis\r\nLost to Follow-Up\r\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\r\nMale\r\nNeuroimaging\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/diagnostic imaging/metabolism\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nYoung Adult\r\nAdolescent\r\nAnterior cingulated cortex\r\nDocosahexaenoic acid\r\nDorsolateral prefrontal cortex\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nProton magnetic resonance spectroscopy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McNamara RK, Jandacek R, Rider T, Tso P, Chu WJ, Weber WA, Welge JA, Strawn JR, Adler CM, and DelBello MP (2016) Effects of fish oil supplementation on prefrontal metabolite concentrations in adolescents with major depressive disorder: a preliminary 1H MRS study..

Cross-national and cross-sectional data suggest that greater habitual intake of preformed EPA+DHA is associated with reduced risk for developing depressive symptoms and syndromal MDD. Erythrocyte EPA and DHA composition is highly correlated with habitual fish or fish oil intake, and case-control studies have consistently observed lower erythrocyte EPA and/or DHA levels in patients with MDD. Low erythrocyte EPA+DHA composition may also be associated with increased risk for suicide and cardiovascular disease, two primary causes of excess premature mortality in MDD. While controversial, dietary EPA+DHA supplementation may have antidepressant properties and may augment the therapeutic efficacy of antidepressant medications. Neuroimaging and rodent neurodevelopmental studies further suggest that low LCn-3 fatty acid intake or biostatus can recapitulate central pathophysiological features associated with MDD. Prospective findings suggest that low LCn-3 fatty acid biostatus increases risk for depressive symptoms in part by augmenting pro-inflammatory responsivity. When taken collectively, these translational findings provide a strong empirical foundation in support of dietary LCn-3 fatty acid deficiency as a modifiable risk factor for MDD.

METHODS: Thirty-nine antidepressant-free youth with a current depressive disorder diagnosis and a biological parent with bipolar I disorder were randomized to 12-week double-blind treatment with FO or placebo. At baseline and endpoint, fMRI (4 Tesla) scans were obtained while performing a continuous performance task with emotional and neutral distractors (CPT-END).

Measures of depression, mania, global symptom severity, and erythrocyte fatty acids were obtained. RESULTS: Erythrocyte EPA+DHA composition increased significantly in the FO group (+47%, p ≤ 0.0001) but not in the placebo group (-10%, p = 0.11).

Research suggests an association between the inclusion of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet and a reduced risk for depression. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acid supplements in alleviating depressive symptoms in patients with mild to moderate depression. A total of 165 patients suffering from mild to moderated depression were randomized to receive omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, an antidepressant (single agent), or a combination of an antidepressant and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. The clinical features of depression were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) during the follow-up period. A statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms was observed from baseline to first, second and third follow-ups within each treatment arm as measured by HRDS scores (p = 0.00001). Further, the HDRS scores at the third follow-up were significantly lower in patients on combination therapy of omega-3 fatty acid supplement and antidepressants (arm-3) than the patients on the omega-3 fatty acid supplement alone (arm-1) [Q = 5.89; p = 0.0001] or the patients taking an antidepressant alone (arm 2) [Q = 4.36; p = 0.0068]. The combination of an omega-3 fatty acid supplement and an antidepressant elicited significantly higher improvement in depressive symptoms than the supplement or the antidepressant alone.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mehdi S ; Manohar K ; Shariff A ; Kinattingal N ; Wani SUD ; Alshehri S ; Imam MT ; Shakeel F ; Krishna KL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/jpm13020224 ","Keywords":"adjunct therapy\r\nantidepressants\r\ndepression\r\nmental health\r\nomega-3 fatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mehdi S, Manohar K, Shariff A, Kinattingal N, Wani SUD, Alshehri S, Imam MT, Shakeel F, and Krishna KL (2023) Omega-3 Fatty Acids Supplementation in the Treatment of Depression: An Observational Study..

Despite the well-defined symptomatology, major depression is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder whose pathophysiology is not clearly established. Although several treatments are available, most depressed patients do not achieve the complete remission of symptoms. Factors linked to the persistence of the disorder have been investigated, particularly those related to the way of life. Moreover, it has been suggested that nutritional aspects may influence its development. Among them, a diet rich in ω-3 has been associated with a reduced risk of major depression, although its deficiency is associated with depressive disorders. METHODS: This review provides a general view about evidences of the use of ω-3 in major depression cases. RESULTS: Several studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of ω-3 in the prevention and treatment of major depression. However, not all the results have shown significant statistical benefits. CONCLUSIONS: More studies are necessary to clarify detailed mechanisms of the antidepressant effects of ω-3 and may explain the source of contradictions in results published until the moment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mello AH ; Gassenferth A ; Souza LR ; Fortunato JJ ; Rezin GT ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/neu.2013.52 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*diet therapy/*prevention & control\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mello AH, Gassenferth A, Souza LR, Fortunato JJ, and Rezin GT (2014) ω-3 and major depression: a review..

This randomised controlled trial aimed to investigate the cognitive effects of a DHA fish oil supplement in older adults with mild cognitive impairment, and to examine the moderating effect of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 allele on cognition and well-being. METHODS/DESIGN: Seventy-two older adults between the ages of 60 and 90 from New Zealand were given a DHA supplement equivalent to 1491 mg DHA + 351 mg eicosapentaenoic acid per day or a placebo for a period of 12 months. Outcome measures included cognition, wellbeing and self-rated quality of life as well as height, weight, blood pressure and APOE genotyping. RESULTS: The final analysis (n = 60) found no evidence of a treatment effect on cognitive measures, although did find a treatment effect on systolic blood pressure (p = 0.03, ƞ(2) = 0.08), and a treatment interaction for APOE ɛ4 carriers on depression (p = 0.04, ƞ(2) = 0.07) and anxiety (p = 0.02, ƞ(2) = 0.09) scores in favour of the DHA supplement. CONCLUSIONS: Despite no effect on cognition, the positive result in APOE ɛ4 carriers on depression and anxiety scores and on systolic blood pressure justifies further DHA trials. It may be a prudent step going forward for more studies to replicate the design elements (dose, duration and cognitive measures) of previous DHA trials to help understand why not all older adults appear to benefit from taking a fish oil supplement.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mengelberg A ; Leathem J ; Podd J ; Hill S ; Conlon C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/gps.5707 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nCognition\r\n*Cognitive Dysfunction/drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\n*Docosahexaenoic Acids/therapeutic use\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nHumans\r\nQuality of Life\r\nAPOE ɛ4 carriers\r\nDHA\r\nEPA\r\nmild cognitive impairment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mengelberg A, Leathem J, Podd J, Hill S, and Conlon C (2022) The effects of docosahexaenoic acid supplementation on cognition and well-being in mild cognitive impairment: A 12-month randomised controlled trial..

Case-control studies have consistently observed low erythrocyte (red blood cell) EPA and/or DHA levels in patients with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Low erythrocyte EPA + DHA biostatus can be treated with fish oil-based formulations containing preformed EPA + DHA, and extant evidence suggests that fish oil supplementation is safe and well-tolerated and may have therapeutic benefits. These and other data provide a rationale for screening for and treating LCn-3 fatty acid deficiency in patients with psychiatric illness. To this end, we have implemented a pilot program that routinely measures blood fatty acid levels in psychiatric patients entering a residential inpatient clinic. To date over 130 blood samples, primarily from patients with treatment-refractory mood or anxiety disorders, have been collected and analyzed. Our initial results indicate that the majority (75 %) of patients exhibit whole blood EPA + DHA levels at ≤ 4 percent of total fatty acid composition, a rate that is significantly higher than general population norms (25 %). In a sub-set of cases, corrective treatment with fish oil-based products has resulted in improvements in psychiatric symptoms without notable side effects. In view of the urgent need for improvements in conventional treatment algorithms, these preliminary findings provide important support for expanding this approach in routine psychiatric practice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Messamore E ; McNamara RK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12944-016-0196-5 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAttention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/blood\r\nBipolar Disorder/blood\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/blood\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/blood\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/blood\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*blood\r\nHumans\r\nSchizophrenia/blood","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Messamore E, and McNamara RK (2016) Detection and treatment of omega-3 fatty acid deficiency in psychiatric practice: Rationale and implementation..

Nutritional interventions to correct prisoner behaviour have been largely overlooked in the literature. Emerging evidence suggests that dietary intake influences aggressive behaviours and that nutritional supplementation with omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) could attenuate both the severity and frequency of aggressive behaviour. METHODS: Adult male prisoners who have a history of aggressive behaviour (n = 600) will be recruited from at least 6 Correctional Centres and randomised to receive either n-3 LCPUFA or placebo supplementation for a 16-week duration. Treatment will be with either 1 g/day of n-3 LCPUFA (694 mg DHA and 397 mg EPA) or placebo capsules, which are a corn/soy oil blend and are identical in size and colour. The primary outcome measure is the Inmate Behavioural Observation Scale (IBOS): an objective measure of aggressive behaviour. Secondary outcome measures include questionnaires (including aggression, attention deficit disorder, impulsivity, depression/anxiety/stress scales), engagement in programmes, recidivism and quality of life. Baseline and post-intervention assessments include the IBOS, questionnaires and blood to measure the levels of n-3 LCPUFA. DISCUSSION: To conclusively test the potential that increasing n-3 LCPUFA intakes can improve rates of prisoner aggression and associated mental health and violence-related social system management costs, we propose an adequately powered multi-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, examining the effects of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on aggressive behaviour in adult male prisoners. If successful, this study will inform prisoner policy with respect to nutrition and by inference contribute to a broader community approach to preventative mental health practices.

However, evidence for an influence of dietary cholesterol on behavioral models is poor. Here, we investigated the behavioral changes of Wistar male rats fed a 2% cholesterol-enriched diet for 2 months in experimental models of depression and anxiety, such as the forced swim test (FST) paradigm and the novelty-induced grooming sampling test (NGT). The correlation between behavioral depression and impaired cognitive capacity was also examined testing rats in the Morris water maze (MWM) task one day after the FST. Different groups of rats fed various dietary regimens, were subjected to acute or repeated treatment (14 days) with clomipramine hydrochloride (50 or 25 mg/kg), diazepam (1 mg/kg) or with the peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) antagonist, isoquinoline PK11195 (1 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally (i.p.). Rats fed the cholesterol-enriched diet showed a significant decrease of grooming score in the NGT and of immobility time in the FST in comparison to animals fed a standard diet. Furthermore, the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of diazepam and clomipramine were not affected by the different diets. Only after repeated treatment, PK11195 impaired the performance of animals fed a standard diet in the FST, and exhibited an anxiolytic-like profile in animals fed either the cholesterol-enriched or the standard diet. The improved performance in the FST was followed by a better learning performance in the acquisition phase of the MWM. These results suggest that effects of cholesterol-enriched diet on the behavioral reaction of rats in experimental models of mild stress may involve PBRs. They deserve attention in order to clarify the clinical correlation between plasma cholesterol levels and mood disorders in humans.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Micale V ; Scapagnini G ; Colombrita C ; Mazzola C ; Alkon DL ; Drago F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.euroneuro.2007.11.006 ","Keywords":"Analysis of Variance\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use\r\nAntineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nCholesterol, Dietary/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nClomipramine/therapeutic use\r\nCognition/*drug effects/physiology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nGrooming/drug effects/physiology\r\nImmobility Response, Tonic/drug effects/physiology\r\nIsoquinolines/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMaze Learning/drug effects/physiology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nStress, Psychological/*diet therapy/drug therapy\r\nSwimming\r\nTime Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Micale V, Scapagnini G, Colombrita C, Mazzola C, Alkon DL, and Drago F (2008) Behavioral effects of dietary cholesterol in rats tested in experimental models of mild stress and cognition tasks..

DHA deficiency states, such as alcoholism and the postpartum period, also are linked with depression. Individuals with major depression have marked depletions in omega-3 FAs (especially DHA) in erythrocyte phospholipids compared with controls. These data suggest that DHA may be associated with depression, and the limited data available on supplementation with DHA or other omega-3 FAs seem to support the hypothesis that DHA may have psychotropic effects. Overall, the use of EFAs is promising, particularly in view of the many illnesses potentially treatable with these substances; however, larger, carefully designed studies are needed to establish whether DHA is an effective and safe antidepressant, mood stabilizer, or antipsychotic. A few preliminary trials of DHA are in progress, but no studies comparing DHA against placebo or against an established antidepressant have been carried out. Studies to address this issue are being developed at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Studies likely will require escalating doses of DHA, eventually reaching high levels so as to ensure that patients will avoid a potentially ineffective subclinical dose. Careful monitoring of dietary intake among subjects also will necessary because a high intake of omega-3-rich foods may confound results. Finally, large-scale, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials comparing the efficacy and safety of DHA against standard antidepressants are required before psychiatrists can recommend DHA therapy as effective and safe for the treatment of depression and other mood disorders. Given the popularity of self-medication by patients who already are taking marketed antidepressants, studies examining the use of DHA as an augmentor to standard antidepressants may answer whether DHA can occupy a niche as an augmenting agent for patients who have made a partial response or have not responded to conventional antidepressants. Considering that natural medications generally seem best for treating mild to moderate illness, the role of DHA as a therapy for minor and subsyndromal depression also should be considered. It is hoped that studies of these types will help to clarify some of the knowledge gaps outlined in this article.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mischoulon D ; Fava M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0193-953x(05)70197-0 ","Keywords":"Clinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mischoulon D, and Fava M (2000) Docosahexanoic acid and omega-3 fatty acids in depression..

Current research data are compelling, from a standpoint of both efficacy and safety, but before clinicians can recommend these as first-line treatments, more well-designed controlled studies in large patient populations are needed. During the past decade, the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute for Mental Health, and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine have widened their support for research on the efficacy and safety of alternative treatments, and increasing numbers of academic institutions are undertaking large-scale, multicenter studies on the natural medications reviewed here, as well as others. These studies should help answer some of the yet-unsettled questions about natural medications. Psychiatrists who are considering recommending natural antidepressants to their patients should emphasize that these treatments are relatively unproven and that it remains to be seen whether they would be appropriate or preferable to the conventional psychotropic agents. in the absence of more conclusive data, the best candidates for alternative treatments may be patients for whom a delay in adequate treatment would not be devastating(eg, the mildly symptomatic patient who has a strong interest in natural remedies). Other good candidates may include patients who have been unresponsive to conventional antidepressants or particularly intolerant of side effects; these patients, however, often are the most difficult to treat, and alternative agents seem best suited for the mildly ill. Care should be taken with patients who are taking multiple medications, in view of adverse drug-drug interactions that have emerged with increased use of alternative treatments. Finally, as with all psychotropic agents, natural medications should be used preferably under the supervision of a physician.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mischoulon D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.psc.2006.12.003 ","Keywords":"Complementary Therapies/*methods\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3\r\nHumans\r\nHypericum\r\nPhytotherapy/*methods","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mischoulon D (2007) Update and critique of natural remedies as antidepressant treatments..

METHOD: Fifty-seven adults with DSM-IV MDD were randomly assigned from January 2003 until June 2006 to receive 1 g/d of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or placebo for 8 weeks in a double-blind, randomized, controlled pilot study. Response criteria were on the basis of the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17). Subjects' plasma lipid profiles were examined by gas chromatography. RESULTS: Thirty-five subjects (63% female; mean +/- SD age = 45 +/- 13 years) were eligible for the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. In the ITT sample, mean +/- SD HDRS-17 scores decreased from 21.6 +/- 2.7 to 13.9 +/- 8.9 for the EPA group (n = 16) and from 20.5 +/- 3.6 to 17.5 +/- 7.5 for the placebo group (n = 19) (P = .123); the effect size for EPA was 0.55. ITT response rates were 38% (6/16) for EPA, and 21% (4/19) for placebo (P = .45). Among the 24 study completers, mean +/- SD HDRS-17 scores decreased from 21.3 +/- 3.0 to 11.1 +/- 8.1 for the EPA group and from 20.5 +/- 3.8 to 16.3 +/- 6.9 for the placebo group (P = .087); the effect size for EPA was 0.73. Completer response rates were 45% (5/11) for EPA, and 23% (3/13) for placebo (P = .39). Among EPA subjects, baseline n-6/n-3 ratio was associated with decrease in HDRS-17 score (r = -0.686, P = .030) and with treatment response (P = .032); change in n-6/n-3 ratio was associated with change in HDRS-17 score (r = .784, P = .032). Side effects, reported in 2 EPA subjects and 5 placebo subjects, were exclusively gastrointestinal, mild, and not associated with discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: EPA demonstrated an advantage over placebo that did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to the small sample and low completer rates, which were the major study limitations.

Moreover, indications exist that these factors are associated with antidepressant-response. If we better understand these associations, we might identify novel targets for add-on therapy to increase antidepressant-response, and/or early indicators to improve response prediction. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether alterations in FA-metabolism, and their relationship with the HPA-axis, are associated with prospective response to the antidepressant paroxetine in MDD. DESIGN: We first compared 70 initially unmedicated MDD-patients with 51 age- and gender-matched controls at study-entry, regarding salivary cortisol and erythrocyte membrane FAs [omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), FA-chain length, -unsaturation and -peroxidizability]. Subsequently, we treated patients with 6 weeks 20mg/day selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine. After 6 weeks, we continued this treatment in responders (i.e. showing ≥50% decrease in Hamilton depression rating scale-score), and randomized non-responders to a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-escalation up to 50mg/day. We repeated cortisol and FA-measures in patients after 6 and 12 weeks. RESULTS: Compared to controls, patients showed higher FA-chain length, FA-unsaturation and FA-peroxidation, and more negative relationships of FA-unsaturation and FA-peroxidation with cortisol. Moreover, these negative relationships were associated with paroxetine nonresponse. Nonresponse was also associated with low DHA, which was related to low fatty fish intake. Furthermore, early responders showed initial low FA-chain length, FA-peroxidation and EPA that increased during the study, while non-responders exhibited opposite patterns. CONCLUSIONS: FA-metabolism alterations, and their relationship with cortisol, are associated with prospective paroxetine response in MDD, and may therefore form an early indicator of treatment effectiveness. Moreover, dietary fatty fish intake may improve antidepressant response through an effect on FA-metabolism.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mocking RJ ; Verburg HF ; Westerink AM ; Assies J ; Vaz FM ; Koeter MW ; Ruhé HG ; Schene AH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.04.027 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCase-Control Studies\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/*metabolism\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid\r\nFatty Acids/*metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nHydrocortisone/metabolism\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*metabolism\r\nLipid Metabolism\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nMale\r\nParoxetine/*therapeutic use\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System/*metabolism\r\nSaliva/metabolism\r\nCortisol\r\nDocosahexaenoic acid\r\nEicosapentaenoic acid\r\nFatty acids\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nParoxetine\r\nPrognosis\r\nSerotonin uptake inhibitors\r\nn-3 PUFA","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mocking RJ, Verburg HF, Westerink AM, Assies J, Vaz FM, Koeter MW, Ruhé HG, and Schene AH (2015) Fatty acid metabolism and its longitudinal relationship with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in major depression: Associations with prospective antidepressant response..

In the present meta-analysis, we pooled randomized placebo-controlled trials assessing the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on depressive symptoms in MDD. Moreover, we performed meta-regression to test whether supplementation effects depended on eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid dose, their ratio, study duration, participants' age, percentage antidepressant users, baseline MDD symptom severity, publication year and study quality. To limit heterogeneity, we only included studies in adult patients with MDD assessed using standardized clinical interviews, and excluded studies that specifically studied perinatal/perimenopausal or comorbid MDD. Our PubMED/EMBASE search resulted in 1955 articles, from which we included 13 studies providing 1233 participants. After taking potential publication bias into account, meta-analysis showed an overall beneficial effect of omega-3 PUFAs on depressive symptoms in MDD (standardized mean difference=0.398 (0.114-0.682), P=0.006, random-effects model). As an explanation for significant heterogeneity (I(2)=73.36, P<0.001), meta-regression showed that higher EPA dose (β=0.00037 (0.00009-0.00065), P=0.009), higher percentage antidepressant users (β=0.0058 (0.00017-0.01144), P=0.044) and earlier publication year (β=-0.0735 (-0.143 to 0.004), P=0.04) were significantly associated with better outcome for PUFA supplementation. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed. In conclusion, present meta-analysis suggested a beneficial overall effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation in MDD patients, especially for higher doses of EPA and in participants taking antidepressants. Future precision medicine trials should establish whether possible interactions between EPA and antidepressants could provide targets to improve antidepressant response and its prediction. Furthermore, potential long-term biochemical side effects of high-dosed add-on EPA supplementation should be carefully monitored.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mocking RJ ; Harmsen I ; Assies J ; Koeter MW ; Ruhé HG ; Schene AH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/tp.2016.29 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/*therapeutic use\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/*therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nRegression Analysis","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mocking RJ, Harmsen I, Assies J, Koeter MW, Ruhé HG, and Schene AH (2016) Meta-analysis and meta-regression of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for major depressive disorder..

This narrative review will provide an up-to-date summary of how metabolism is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of these psychiatric disorders. We will focus on (I) the important role of fatty acids in these metabolic alterations, (II) whether fatty acid alterations represent epiphenomena or risk factors, and (III) similarities and dissociations in fatty acid alterations between different psychiatric disorders. (Historical) epidemiological evidence links fatty acid intake to psychiatric disorder prevalence, corroborated by altered fatty acid concentrations measured in psychiatric patients. These fatty acid alterations are connected with other concomitant pathophysiological mechanisms, including biological stress (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis and oxidative stress), inflammation, and brain network structure and function. Metabolomics and lipidomics studies are underway to more deeply investigate this complex network of associated neurometabolic alterations. Supplementation of fatty acids as disease-modifying nutraceuticals has clinical potential, particularly add-on eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in depressed patients with markers of increased inflammation. However, by interpreting the observed fatty acid alterations as partly (mal)adaptive phenomena, we attempt to nuance translational expectations and provide new clinical applications for these novel neurometabolic insights, e.g., to predict treatment response or depression recurrence. In conclusion, placing fatty acids in context can contribute to further understanding and optimized treatment of psychiatric disorders, in order to diminish their overwhelming burden of disease.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mocking RJT ; Assies J ; Ruhé HG ; Schene AH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s10545-018-0158-3 ","Keywords":"Eicosapentaenoic Acid/analogs & derivatives\r\nFatty Acids/*metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*metabolism\r\nInflammation/metabolism\r\nMental Disorders/*metabolism/physiopathology\r\nMetabolism, Inborn Errors/metabolism\r\nOxidative Stress\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System/*metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mocking RJT, Assies J, Ruhé HG, and Schene AH (2018) Focus on fatty acids in the neurometabolic pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders..

We performed a meta-analysis of RCTs on omega-3 PUFAs for perinatal depression, comparing a priori defined subgroups: pregnant women vs postpartum women and prevention vs treatment of perinatal depression. METHODS: We searched Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library, combining omega-3 PUFAs and perinatal depression terms and including publications up to February 18, 2019, for RCTs on omega-3 PUFAs compared to placebo or any active comparator. RESULTS: Data from 18 RCTs on 4,052 participants showed an overall significant small beneficial effect of omega-3 PUFAs on depressive symptoms compared to placebo (-0.236 standardized difference in means [SDM]; 95% CI = -0.463 to -0.009; P = .042). Heterogeneity was considerable (I² = 88.58; P < .001), with significant subgroup differences explaining 55% of between-study variance (P = .001). In depressed women, omega-3 PUFAs showed a medium effect (SDM = -0.545; 95% CI = -1.182 to 0.093; P = .094) vs no effect in nondepressed women (SDM = -0.073). Moreover, the effect was medium to large in postpartum women (SDM = -0.656; 95% CI = -1.690 to 0.378; P = .214) compared to a negligible effect during pregnancy (SDM = -0.071). RCTs specifically studying postpartum depression showed the largest effect (SDM = -0.886; 95% CI = -2.088 to 0.316; P = .149). CONCLUSIONS: Omega-3 PUFAs have an overall significant small beneficial effect on perinatal depression, with important subgroup differences. We advise against prescribing omega-3 PUFAs for the treatment or prevention of depressive symptoms during pregnancy, given a lack of effect with low heterogeneity. In contrast, omega-3 PUFA supplementation may be a promising (add-on) treatment for postpartum depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mocking RJT ; Steijn K ; Roos C ; Assies J ; Bergink V ; Ruhé HG ; Schene AH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.19r13106 ","Keywords":"Depression, Postpartum/*drug therapy/prevention & control\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nPregnancy\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mocking RJT, Steijn K, Roos C, Assies J, Bergink V, Ruhé HG, and Schene AH (2020) Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation for Perinatal Depression: A Meta-Analysis..

Methods In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 90 depressed patients were selected and divided into three groups: aromatherapy, breathing exercise, and routine care using a random allocation method. Before undergoing ECT, the aromatherapy group was exposed to the inhaled lavender essential oil (n = 30), the breathing exercise group performed the breathing exercises (n = 30), and the routine care group received routine care (n = 30). Before (20 min) and after the intervention (30 min later), patients' anxiety was assessed using Beck Anxiety Inventory. Results After the intervention, the results revealed that anxiety score changes were statistically significant among the three groups (p < 0.001). In addition, it was found that the patients' mean anxiety scores significantly decreased in the aromatherapy and breathing exercise groups compared to with the pre-intervention scores (p < 0.001).

N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) containing lipids are known to be anti-inflammatory, whereas the sphingolipid, ceramide (Cer), is an inducer of neuroinflammation and degeneration. Using Fat1(+)-transgenic mice that contain elevated levels of systemic n-3 PUFA, we tested whether they are resistant to mild TBI-mediated sensory-motor and emotional deficits by subjecting Fat1-transgenic mice and their WT littermates to focal cranial air blast (50 psi) or sham blast (0 psi, control). We observed that visual function in WT mice was reduced significantly following TBI but not in Fat1(+)-blast animals. We also found Fat1(+)-blast mice were resistant to the decline in motor functions, depression, and fear-producing effects of blast, as well as the reduction in the area of oculomotor nucleus and increase in activated microglia in the optic tract in brain sections seen following blast in WT mice. Lipid and gene expression analyses confirmed an elevated level of the n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in the plasma and brain, blocking of TBI-mediated increase of Cer in the brain, and decrease in TBI-mediated induction of Cer biosynthetic and inflammatory gene expression in the brain of the Fat1(+) mice. Our results demonstrate that suppression of ceramide biosynthesis and inflammatory factors in Fat1(+)-transgenic mice is associated with significant protection against the visual, motor, and emotional deficits caused by mild TBI. This study suggests that n-3 PUFA (especially, EPA) has a promising therapeutic role in preventing neurodegeneration after TBI.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mondal K ; Takahashi H ; Cole J 2nd; Del Mar NA ; Li C ; Stephenson DJ ; Allegood J ; Cowart LA ; Chalfant CE ; Reiner A ; Mandal N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s12035-021-02501-y ","Keywords":"Affective Symptoms/blood/etiology/*prevention & control\r\nAnimals\r\nBrain Chemistry\r\nBrain Concussion/*blood/complications/psychology\r\nCadherins/genetics/*physiology\r\nCeramides/biosynthesis\r\nDepression/blood/etiology/prevention & control\r\nDisease Resistance\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*blood/physiology\r\nFear\r\nFemale\r\nHead Injuries, Closed/*blood/complications/psychology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nMice, Transgenic\r\nMovement Disorders/blood/etiology/*prevention & control\r\nNeuroinflammatory Diseases\r\nOpen Field Test\r\nOxidative Stress\r\nRecombinant Proteins/metabolism\r\nSphingolipids/analysis\r\nSphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/analysis\r\nVision Disorders/blood/etiology/*prevention & control\r\nCeramide\r\nEmotional deficits\r\nFearfulness\r\nNeuroinflammation\r\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI)\r\nVisual deficits\r\nn-3 PUFA","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mondal K, Takahashi H, Cole J 2nd, Del Mar NA, Li C, Stephenson DJ, Allegood J, Cowart LA, Chalfant CE, Reiner A, and Mandal N (2021) Systemic Elevation of n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (n-3-PUFA) Is Associated with Protection against Visual, Motor, and Emotional Deficits in Mice following Closed-Head Mild Traumatic Brain Injury..

OBJECTIVES: To review the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids as either a monotherapy or an adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorder. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic searches of the following databases were performed: CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References were searched on 12/2/2008, Supplementary searches were carried out on Biological Abstracts, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, CCDAN Register, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. The search strategy also included cited reference searching, personal contact with all authors of studies initially included and contact with the omega-3 producing pharmaceutical companies. SELECTION CRITERIA: All relevant randomised controlled trials were included in the review. Studies involving males and females of all ages with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder qualified for inclusion. Studies using any type or dose of omega-3 fatty acid treatment as monotherapy or in addition to standard pharmacotherapy were eligible. The primary outcome was symptom severity; and secondary outcomes were adverse effects, dropout and satisfaction with treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently inspected the citations identified from the search. Potentially relevant abstracts were identified and full papers ordered and reassessed for inclusion and methodological quality. All relevant data were extracted. The weighted mean difference (WMD) was used for continuous outcome data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). MAIN RESULTS: Five studies met inclusion criteria for the review, however, methodological quality was highly variable. Only one study, involving 75 participants, provided data for analysis, and showed a benefit of active treatment over control for depression symptom levels (WMD -3.93, 95% CI -7.00 to -0.86)and Clinical Global Impression scores (WMD -0.75, 95% CI -1.33 to -0.17) but not for mania (WMD -2.81, 95% CI -7.68 to 1.90). No serious adverse effects were reported in the five studies. The pattern of dropout was highly variable between studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Results from one study showed positive effects of omega-3 as an adjunctive treatment for depressive but not manic symptoms in bipolar disorder. These findings must be regarded with caution owing to the limited data available. There is an acute need for well-designed and executed randomised controlled trials in this field.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Montgomery P ; Richardson AJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD005169.pub2 ","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/therapeutic use\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Montgomery P, and Richardson AJ (2008) Omega-3 fatty acids for bipolar disorder..

By 2050, it is estimated that there will be two billion people aged 60 years or over, of which 131 million are projected to be affected by dementia, while depression is predicted to be the second leading cause of disability worldwide by 2020. Preventing or delaying the onset of these disorders should therefore be a public health priority. There is some evidence linking certain dietary patterns, particularly the Mediterranean diet, with a reduced risk of dementia and depression. Specific dietary components have also been investigated in relation to brain health, with emerging evidence supporting protective roles for n-3 PUFA, polyphenols, vitamin D and B-vitamins. At this time, the totality of evidence is strongest in support of a role for folate and the metabolically related B-vitamins (vitamin B12, vitamin B6 and riboflavin) in slowing the progression of cognitive decline and possibly reducing the risk of depression in ageing. Future studies incorporating new technologies, such as MRI and magnetoencephalography, offer much promise in identifying effective nutrition interventions that could reduce the risk of cognitive and mental disorders. This review will explore the ageing brain and the emerging evidence linking diet and specific nutrients with cognitive function and depression in ageing, with the potential to develop strategies that could improve quality of life in our ageing population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Moore K ; Hughes CF ; Ward M ; Hoey L ; McNulty H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S0029665117004177 ","Keywords":"Aging/*physiology\r\nBrain/*drug effects/physiology\r\nCognition/drug effects\r\nCognition Disorders/*prevention & control\r\nDementia/*prevention & control\r\nDepression/*prevention & control\r\n*Diet\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/prevention & control\r\nNutrients/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\n*Nutritional Status\r\nPolyphenols/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nVitamins/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAD Alzheimer's disease\r\nMCI mild cognitive impairment\r\nRCT randomised controlled trial\r\nAgeing\r\nB-vitamins\r\nCognition\r\nDepression\r\nNutrition","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Moore K, Hughes CF, Ward M, Hoey L, and McNulty H (2018) Diet, nutrition and the ageing brain: current evidence and new directions..

Many pathologies have been indicated as comorbid with depression and in particular, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's diseases (AD). In this regard, several evidences endorse a strong relationship between depression and AD, so much that this mental illness has been proposed either as a risk factor for AD or as a prodromic AD phase. Furthermore, amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, the main constituent of amyloid plaques commonly considered the principal hallmark of AD brains, has been shown to be increased, in its soluble form, in depressed patients. Accordingly, we have previously found that Aβ, intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) injected, is able to evoke a depressive-like profile in rats accompanied by low cortical serotonin and reduced neurotrophin content. Taking into account the great increase in AD and depression prevalence, many environmental factors have been under study, particularly dietary factors, and the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is becoming central in this field of research. Thus, aim of the present study was to evaluate the neurobehavioral effects of lifelong exposure to either n-3 PUFA rich or n-3 PUFA poor diet after Aβ central administration. Results showed that n-3 PUFA enriched diet prevented the Aβ- induced depressive-like behaviors, as reveled by the reduction in the immobility time in the FST test. Furthermore, n-3 PUFA rich diet exposure reverted also serotonin and neurotrophin level reduction in prefrontal cortex of Aβ treated rats. Taken together, our data support the concept that supplementation of diet with n-3 PUFA represents a valid approach to reduce the risk of developing depressive symptoms, as well as reducing the risk of Aβ-related pathologies, such as AD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Morgese MG ; Schiavone S ; Mhillaj E ; Bove M ; Tucci P ; Trabace L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.phrs.2017.11.034 ","Keywords":"Alzheimer Disease/*diet therapy/metabolism\r\nAmyloid beta-Peptides\r\nAnimals\r\nDepression/*diet therapy/metabolism\r\nDiet\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-6/administration & dosage\r\nMale\r\nNerve Growth Factors/metabolism\r\nPeptide Fragments\r\nPhenotype\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/metabolism\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nAmyloid beta\r\nDepression\r\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nSerotonin","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Morgese MG, Schiavone S, Mhillaj E, Bove M, Tucci P, and Trabace L (2018) N-3 PUFA diet enrichment prevents amyloid beta-induced depressive-like phenotype..

Eighty-one mild-to-moderately depressed outpatients were randomly assigned to receive either 1g/d of EPA or DHA or placebo (coconut oil) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) final score in the modified intention-to-treat population, which comprised of all randomized patients with at least 1 post-randomization observation (n=62; 61.3% female; mean age 35.1 ± 1.2 years). Allocated treatments were well tolerated. Although there was no significant difference between groups at baseline, patients in the EPA group showed a significantly lower mean HDRS score at study endpoint compared with those in the DHA (p<0.001) or placebo (p=0.002) groups. Furthermore, response to treatment (defined as a ≥ 50% decrease from the baseline HDRS score) was only observed in 6 patients receiving EPA, while no one in any of DHA or placebo groups responded to treatment.

While antidepressants are readily used in pregnancy, studies have raised concerns regarding neurobehavioral outcomes in exposed infants. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, most frequently from fish oil, has emerged as a possible treatment or prevention strategy for MDD in non-pregnant individuals, and may have beneficial effects in pregnant women. Although published observational studies in the psychiatric literature suggest that maternal docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) deficiency may lead to the development of MDD in pregnancy and postpartum, there are more intervention trials suggesting clinical benefit for supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in MDD. METHODS/DESIGN: The Mothers, Omega-3 and Mental Health study is a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial to assess whether omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may prevent antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms among pregnant women at risk for depression. We plan to recruit 126 pregnant women at less than 20 weeks gestation from prenatal clinics at two health systems in Ann Arbor, Michigan and the surrounding communities. We will follow them prospectively over the course of their pregnancies and up to 6 weeks postpartum. Enrolled participants will be randomized to one of three groups: a) EPA-rich fish oil supplement (1060 mg EPA plus 274 mg DHA) b) DHA-rich fish oil supplement (900 mg DHA plus 180 mg EPA; or c) a placebo. The primary outcome for this study is the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score at 6 weeks postpartum. We will need to randomize 126 women to have 80% power to detect a 50% reduction in participants' mean BDI scores with EPA or DHA supplementation compared with placebo. We will also gather information on secondary outcome measures which will include: omega-3 fatty acid concentrations in maternal plasma and cord blood, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) in maternal and cord blood, need for and dosage of antidepressant medications, and obstetrical outcomes. Analyses will be by intent to treat. DISCUSSION: This study compares the relative effectiveness of DHA and EPA at preventing depressive symptoms among pregnant women at risk.

EPA belongs to the class of polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids. The mechanism of its action in depression is not fully understood. There are two related fields where the pathophysiology of refractory depression meets the effect of EPA. First, a general immunosuppressive effect of EPA meets a general immunoactivation in severe depression, especially an increase in CD4/CD8 ratio, neutrophilia, and an increase in interleukins (IL)-6 and IL-12 and of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Secondly, a resistance to dexamethasone (Dex) suppression of the HPA axis meets the effects of EPA on multidrug resistance reversing and HPA axis suppression. The effects of EPA on the immune system, the HPA axis, and multidrug resistance are connected through the action of a transport protein called p-glycoprotein (p-gp). Physiological and synthetic steroids such as cortisol and Dex are substrates of p-gp, and so Dex resistance in depression may be related to dysfunction of this protein. In addition, expression of p-gp is induced by PGE2, and EPA inhibits the synthesis of PGE2. The reversal of drug resistance by EPA may be mediated via this immunological mechanism and lead to its antidepressive efficacy. In addition, antidepressants such as amitriptyline, which have special efficacy in severe depression, decrease p-gp function. EPA may, furthermore, enhance the action of antidepressants, like many SSRIs that are p-gp substrates, which are actively transported out of the intracerebral space at the level of the blood-brain barrier.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Murck H ; Song C ; Horrobin DF ; Uhr M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S1461145704004249 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nCD4-CD8 Ratio\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDexamethasone/*therapeutic use\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology\r\nHumans\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/drug effects/metabolism\r\nImmune System/drug effects\r\nLeukocyte Count\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System/drug effects/metabolism\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Murck H, Song C, Horrobin DF, and Uhr M (2004) Ethyl-eicosapentaenoate and dexamethasone resistance in therapy-refractory depression..

Natural remedies not only act prophylactically, but also help to alleviate symptoms of many diseases and enhance the overall functioning of the internal organs. Many raw materials of natural origin plays a role in treatment of health problems, and also in case of serious diseases such as depression. Depression (affective disorder) now affects about 10% of the population, but in next few years due to the development of civilization and increasing pace of life, the probable number of people suffering from this disease can grow rapidly. Natural raw materials such as Bacopa monnieri, Crocus sativus, Eleutherococcus senticosus, Griffonia simplicifolia, Hypericum perforatum, Sceletium tortuosum, Piper methysticum, Rhodiola rosea, Aspalathus linearis, Camellia sinensis, Ficus carica, Lycium chinense, Cuminum cyminum, Panax Ginseng can effectively assist the prevention and treatment of depression. Daily diet may also have positive effect in prevention of this disease. It was found that 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, L-tryptophan (which are precursors of serotonin in the CNS), omega-3 fatty acids and anthranilic acid (vitamin L1) are able to improve mood. L-Tryptophan, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan are present in the largest quantities in the fruiting bodies of edible mushrooms. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in the flesh of fish, walnuts, soybeans, beans and chicken egg protein, while the anthranilic acid is commonly found in plants.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Muszyńska B ; Łojewski M ; Rojowski J ; Opoka W ; Sułkowska-Ziaja K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.12740/PP/29367 ","Keywords":"5-Hydroxytryptophan/chemistry/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use\r\nCrocus/chemistry\r\nDepression/drug therapy/*prevention & control\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/chemistry/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nHypericum/chemistry\r\nMood Disorders/*prevention & control\r\nPanax/chemistry\r\nPhytotherapy/*methods\r\nPlant Extracts/chemistry\r\nPlant Preparations/chemistry/*therapeutic use\r\nRhodiola/chemistry\r\northo-Aminobenzoates/chemistry/therapeutic use\r\n5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan\r\nPlants and mushrooms in prevention of depression\r\nanthranilic acid","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Muszyńska B, Łojewski M, Rojowski J, Opoka W, and Sułkowska-Ziaja K (2015) Natural products of relevance in the prevention and supportive treatment of depression..

Despite the availability of different classes of antidepressant drugs, most of them are not completely effective and above all are associated with many serious adverse effects. Recently, accumulating evidence suggests that dietary supplements rich in important phytochemicals possess beneficial therapeutic roles in depression. METHODS: In this review, we will first consider what is known about the pathogenesis of depression and discuss the need for more safe and efficacious treatment. We will then review the potential clinical relevance of natural plant-derived products based on data derived from pre-clinical animal studies, randomized controlled studies and placebo-controlled trials published on this topic within the last decade. RESULTS: Among the natural compounds that show antidepressive-like activity, green tea catechins have been shown to decrease depressive symptoms in experimental animals, possibly in part through the inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO). Anthocyanins and their aglycons, responsible for the typical color of berries, inhibit MAO isoforms A or B with IC50 values corresponding to the micromolar range. Other studies suggest that cocoa extracts, whose main components are procyanidins, attenuate depressive symptoms in rats. Resveratrol, one of the most important natural stilbenoid, inhibits noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake in rats, and significantly decreases anxiety/depressive behaviours while increasing hippocampal serotonin and noradrenaline levels. Trans-resveratrol possesses MAO-A inhibitory effects in different brain areas, particularly in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, as already reported for tea catechins. Although these effects have been documented in rodent models, further randomized controlled trials in this area are warranted. However, so far, there is only correlative evidence between certain nutrients, such as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and B vitamins, and depression in human population studies. DISCUSSION: Growing evidence suggests that consumption of these compounds may represent an alternative strategy to delay the onset and progression of depression, and depressive-like symptoms. However, further randomized and placebo-controlled trials are necessary to confirm the potential of these compounds as a possible remedy for this debilitating disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nabavi SM ; Daglia M ; Braidy N ; Nabavi SF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/1028415X.2015.1103461 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntioxidants/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nBiological Products/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/diet therapy/*prevention & control\r\nDepression, Postpartum/diet therapy/prevention & control\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diet therapy/*prevention & control\r\n*Dietary Supplements/adverse effects\r\n*Evidence-Based Medicine\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMicronutrients/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nPhytochemicals/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nPlant Extracts/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressants\r\nDepression\r\nFlavonoids\r\nNatural products\r\nPolyphenols","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nabavi SM, Daglia M, Braidy N, and Nabavi SF (2017) Natural products, micronutrients, and nutraceuticals for the treatment of depression: A short review..

The objective of the current research work was to evaluate the effect of sesame oil, fish oil and mixture of both oils (1:1) on neurobehavioral changes and cognition. For this purpose shark fish oil and sesame oil were extracted out and there poly unsaturated and saturated fatty acids were analyzed by using GCFID that exposed the presence of different PUFs in shark fish oil, sesame oil and mixture of both oils. Neurobehavioral changes were seen after 5ml/kg/day sesame oil, 5ml/kg/day shark fish oil and 1:1 combination of both oil 5ml/kg/day administration on open field, cage crossing, light and dark, stationary rod, forced swimming induced depression test and water maze test. Our GCFID results showed sesame and fish oil enriched with higher amount of PUFs and showed significant anxiolytic and antidepressant like effect after 30 days of treatment (P<0.05) however combination of these both oils exhibited greater efficacy (P<0.01) in reducing anxiety and depression as imipramine standard drug. Results showed that combination of both oils (sesame oil and fish oil) could be a better option to treat neurobehavioral problems as compared to alone.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Naeem S ; Ali L ; Rizwani GH ; Ikram R ; Khan SS ; Shareef H ; Younus I ; Malick TZ ; Aleem U ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFish Oils/isolation & purification/*pharmacology\r\nLocomotion/*drug effects/physiology\r\nMale\r\nMaze Learning/*drug effects/physiology\r\nMice\r\nSesame Oil/isolation & purification/*pharmacology\r\nSharks\r\nSwimming/*psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Naeem S, Ali L, Rizwani GH, Ikram R, Khan SS, Shareef H, Younus I, Malick TZ, and Aleem U (2020) A comparative neurobehavioral study of sesame oil and fish oil on experimental animals..

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of inhaled Lavandula angustifolia Mill. as a complementary therapy for insomnia in diabetic patients. METHODS: In a randomized crossover placebo-controlled clinical trial, 52 patients with type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and insomnia, defined as Pittsburgh Insomnia Rating Scale-20(PIRS-20)>5,were treated with inhaled lavender or placebo for two periods of 4 weeks duration with one week interval as washing period. Sleep quality, quality of life and mood status were assessed by PIRS-20, WHO Quality of Life-BREF(WHOQOL-BREF) Questionnaire and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scale respectively, at baseline and end of each period of study. Fasting blood glucose (FBS), calorie intake and physical activity were measured before and after the interventions. RESULTS: At the end of study, data of 37 patients (all received both lavender and placebo in cross-over design) were analyzed. Based on crossover analysis the first treatment was not effective on the second treatment. Inhaled lavender resulted in a significant better outcome compared to placebo according to mean PIRS-20, WHOQOL-BREF and Beck Depression Inventory scores in both crossover arms. Likewise there was a significant better outcome in PIRS-20 domains for quality and quantity of sleep after Inhaled lavender compared to placebo. No significant improvement was observed in fasting glucose in lavender compared to placebo administration period. CONCLUSION: Inhaled lavender can improve sleep quality and quantity, quality of life and mood in diabetic patients suffering from insomnia with no significant effect on metabolic status.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nasiri Lari Z; Hajimonfarednejad M ; Riasatian M ; Abolhassanzadeh Z ; Iraji A ; Vojoud M ; Heydari M ; Shams M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jep.2020.112560 ","Keywords":"*Aromatherapy/adverse effects\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\nDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/metabolism/*therapy\r\nHumans\r\n*Lavandula\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOils, Volatile/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nQuality of Life\r\nSleep/drug effects\r\nSleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/metabolism/*therapy\r\nAromatherapy\r\nDiabetes mellitus\r\nEssential oils\r\nInsomnia\r\nLavender\r\nSleep disorder\r\nTraditional medicine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nasiri Lari Z, Hajimonfarednejad M, Riasatian M, Abolhassanzadeh Z, Iraji A, Vojoud M, Heydari M, and Shams M (2020) Efficacy of inhaled Lavandula angustifolia Mill.

METHODS: A total of 40 mice initially trained to consume 2% sucrose solution for 3 weeks were then divided into five groups of eight each. The first group was the normal control, the remaining four groups were exposed to CMS but were force fed with either: 10 mL water per kg bodyweight per day; imipramine (a standard antidepressant) 15 mg kg bodyweight; 30 mg per kg bodyweight polyphenol equivalent extract from pomegranate peel; or 30 mg polyphenols per kg bodyweight with omega-3 fatty acids present, for 50 days. At the end, blood and brain were analyzed for various biomarkers of depression. RESULTS: The flax seed and imipramine groups had significantly increased sucrose consumption, decreased cortisol (blood), decreased epinephrine and norepinephrine concentration, decreased monoamine oxidase A and B activity, and decreased superoxide dismutase activity. Lipid peroxidation was completely inhibited. In contrast, pomegranate peel extract also completely inhibited lipid peroxidation in the brain, and reduced enzyme activity and hormone concentration but to a lesser extent than flax seed. CONCLUSION: Polyphenols from flax seed with omega-3 fatty acids were able to reduce all the CMS effects tested compared to polyphenols from pomegranate peel.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Naveen S ; Siddalingaswamy M ; Singsit D ; Khanum F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/pcn.12100 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBrain/drug effects/metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism/psychology\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nFlax\r\nLipid Peroxidation/drug effects\r\nLythraceae\r\nMice\r\nPlant Extracts/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nPolyphenols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nStress, Psychological/*complications/metabolism/psychology\r\nSuperoxide Dismutase/metabolism\r\nCMS\r\nflax seed\r\nneurotransmitters\r\npomegranate peel\r\nsucrose","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Naveen S, Siddalingaswamy M, Singsit D, and Khanum F (2013) Anti-depressive effect of polyphenols and omega-3 fatty acid from pomegranate peel and flax seed in mice exposed to chronic mild stress..

Rose oil may be a useful treatment for depression because it contains flavonoids which include free radical antioxidant compounds such as rutin and quercetin. We investigated the effects of absolute rose oil (from Rosa × damascena Mill.) and experimental depression on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant levels in the cerebral cortex of rats. Thirty-two male rats were randomly divided into four groups. The first group was used as control, while depression was induced in the second group using chronic mild stress (CMS). Oral (1.5 ml/kg) and vapor (0.15 ml/kg) rose oil were given for 28 days to CMS depression-induced rats, constituting the third and fourth groups, respectively. The sucrose preference test was used weekly to identify depression-like phenotypes during the experiment. At the end of the experiment, cerebral cortex samples were taken from all groups. The lipid peroxidation levels in the cerebral cortex in the CMS group were higher than in control whereas their levels were decreased by rose oil vapor exposure. The vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C and β-carotene concentrations in the cerebral cortex were lower in the CMS group than in the control group whereas their concentrations were higher in the rose oil vapor plus CMS group. The CMS-induced antioxidant vitamin changes were not modulated by oral treatment. Glutathione peroxidase activity and reduced glutathione did not change statistically in the four groups following CMS or either treatment. In conclusion, experimental depression is associated with elevated oxidative stress while treatment with rose oil vapor induced protective effects on oxidative stress in depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nazıroğlu M ; Kozlu S ; Yorgancıgil E ; Uğuz AC ; Karakuş K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11418-012-0666-7 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntioxidants/metabolism\r\nAscorbic Acid/metabolism\r\nBrain/*drug effects/*metabolism\r\nDepression/*metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nGlutathione Peroxidase/metabolism\r\nLipid Peroxidation/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nOxidative Stress/*drug effects\r\nPlant Oils/*therapeutic use\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nRosa/*chemistry\r\nVitamin A/metabolism\r\nVitamin E/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nazıroğlu M, Kozlu S, Yorgancıgil E, Uğuz AC, and Karakuş K (2013) Rose oil (from Rosa × damascena Mill.) vapor attenuates depression-induced oxidative toxicity in rat brain..

Individuals with AN avoid high-fat, high-calorie diets and have shown abnormal metabolism of fatty acids (FAs), which are essential for brain and cognitive/neuropsychiatric health. To clarify the relationship between FAs and AN, fasting and postprandial plasma FAs in AN patients and age-matched control women were analyzed via mass-spectrometry. Clinical phenotypes were assessed using Becker Anxiety Inventory and Becker Depression Inventory. AN patients and controls exhibited different FA signatures at both fasting and postprandial timepoints. Lauric acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and alpha-linoleic acid (ALA) were higher in AN than in controls (lauric acid: 15,081.6 ± 14,970.2 vs. 8257.4 ± 4740.2 pmol/mL; ALA at fasting: 2217.7 ± 1587.6 vs. 1087.9 ± 821.2 pmol/mL; ALA at postprandial: 1830.9 ± 1115.6 vs. 1159.4 ± 664.7 pmol/mL.

Food intake and AN status modified the correlations of FAs with body mass index (BMI), depression, and anxiety. Desaturases SCD-18 and D6D showed lower activities in AN compared to controls. Altered FA signature, specifically correlations between elevated n-3 FAs and worsened symptoms, illustrate metabolic underpinnings in AN. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms by which FA dysregulation, specifically elevated n-3 FAs, affects AN risk and outcome.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nguyen N ; Dow M ; Woodside B ; German JB ; Quehenberger O ; Shih PB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu11092208 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnorexia Nervosa/*blood/psychology\r\nAnxiety/blood\r\nDepression/blood\r\nEating/*physiology\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/blood\r\nFasting\r\nFatty Acid Desaturases\r\nFatty Acid Elongases\r\nFatty Acids/*blood\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/blood\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-6/blood\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/blood\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nPostprandial Period\r\nanorexia nervosa\r\nfatty acids\r\nmetabolic dysregulation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nguyen N, Dow M, Woodside B, German JB, Quehenberger O, and Shih PB (2019) Food-Intake Normalization of Dysregulated Fatty Acids in Women with Anorexia Nervosa..

The current study was conducted to demonstrate the dose-dependent neurobehavioral effects of geraniol. Rats were divided into 5 groups (n=7), comprising of control and four test groups for different doses of geraniol including 10, 30, 50 and 100 mg/kg. Geraniol was given for 15 days through intraperitoneal route. Following the administration, anxiety-, depression-like behaviors and memory function were evaluated. Extent of oxidative stress in rat's brain was also assessed by determining the levels of malondialdehyde and antioxidant enzymes activity. The present study revealed that low doses of geraniol produced more potent anxiolytic, antidepressant, nootropic, and antioxidant effects as compared to the higher doses. The findings highlight the dual characteristic of geraniol, acting as antioxidant at lower doses while at higher doses it produces pro-oxidant effects. The results are discussed in the context of dual characteristic of antioxidant compounds.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nisar R ; Batool Z ; Inamullah A ; Faiz Ghalib AU; Nisar H ; Emad S ; Haider S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Acyclic Monoterpenes/*pharmacology\r\nAnimals\r\nAnxiety/*drug therapy\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBrain\r\nGlutathione/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMalondialdehyde/*blood\r\nMemory/*drug effects\r\nOils, Volatile/*chemistry\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nisar R, Batool Z, Inamullah A, Faiz Ghalib AU, Nisar H, Emad S, and Haider S (2022) Dose-dependent alteration of neurobehavioral activities by geraniol a component of essential oil: A study in rats..

However, evidence has not been well established. Also, the appropriate amount of supplemental omega-3 PUFA is not yet known and may be different among countries due to differences in the consumption of fish, a food rich in omega-3 PUFA. Generally, fish consumption is higher and the prevalence of depression is lower in East Asian countries, such as Japan and Taiwan, compared to Western countries, but there are considerable differences among East Asian countries.1 Our group conducted a randomized controlled trial in Taiwan using supplements with a high ratio of EPA (2.2 g daily) to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (1.2 g daily) and showed efficacy for depression in pregnancy.2 However, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare recommends a daily intake of 1.8 g omega-3 PUFA for pregnant women.3 Thus, we conducted this 12-week, prospective, open-label pilot trial in pregnant women with depressive symptoms in Japan and Taiwan, using supplements containing 1.8 g omega-3 PUFA (1.2 g EPA and 0.6 g DHA) between May 2014 and May 2015. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of Tokyo Medical University, University of Toyama, and Chiba University, Japan, and China Medical University, Taiwan. All participants provided written informed consent after receiving a complete description of the study.\n\nPregnant women between 12 and 24 weeks’ gestation with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores of ≥9 were recruited in Japan and Taiwan. The primary outcome measure was change in total score on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) during the supplementation. The fatty acid composition of erythrocyte membranes was measured to confirm adherence. Of the 13 participants, nine completed the trial. Omega-3 PUFA supplementation was well tolerated, and a significant decrease in HAMD score was observed after 12 weeks of supplementation (mean, 4.8; SD, 4.9) compared with baseline (mean, 12.1; SD, 3.7) (paired t-test; P < 0.01). For reference, the mean score was significantly lower at week 12 than at baseline in completers (n = 9, paired t-test; P < 0.01), but no significant difference was found in non-completers (n = 4, paired t-test; P = 0.11). The mean EPA level increased significantly after omega-3 PUFA supplementation in completers.\n\nThis study suggests the potential efficacy of moderate omega-3 PUFA supplementation for improving depressive symptoms in Japan and Taiwan. It is difficult to exclude the possibility that improvement of depression is due to a placebo effect, spontaneous remission or improvement. Our previous report4 suggested that the placebo effect might act stronger in women in the case of omega-3 PUFA supplementation. A randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm these findings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nishi D ; Su KP ; Usuda K ; Chiang YJ ; Guu TW ; Hamazaki K ; Nakaya N ; Sone T ; Sano Y ; Ito H ; Isaka K ; Hashimoto K ; Hamazaki T ; Matsuoka YJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/pcn.12388 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nJapan\r\n*Outcome Assessment, Health Care\r\nPilot Projects\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/*drug therapy\r\nTaiwan","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nishi D, Su KP, Usuda K, Chiang YJ, Guu TW, Hamazaki K, Nakaya N, Sone T, Sano Y, Ito H, Isaka K, Hashimoto K, Hamazaki T, and Matsuoka YJ (2016) Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for expectant mothers with depressive symptoms in Japan and Taiwan: An open-label trial..

The aim of this pilot study is to explore the feasibility of using 1800 mg of omega-3 PUFAs supplementation for our future double-blind, placebo-control trial, and to clarify the clinical difference and the similarity between two sites of Japan and Taiwan. METHODS: Pregnant women between 12 and 24 weeks' gestation with depressive symptoms were recruited. Participants were supplemented daily with omega-3 PUFAs capsules containing 1206 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 609 mg docosahexaenoic acid for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was change in total score on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) at 12 weeks after supplementation. RESULTS: Eight pregnant women in Japan and five in Taiwan participated in the study. A substantial proportion of pregnant women reported high consumption of omega-3 supplements and dietary fish were excluded in Taiwan rather than in Japan sites. The decrease in HAMD score from baseline to 12 weeks after the start of the intervention was significantly larger in Japanese participants than in Taiwanese participants (Wilcoxon rank sum test; P = 0.045). DISCUSSION: The improvement of depressive symptoms was smaller at the Taiwan site than at the Japan site.

The aims of this study were to examine the association of increased E2 during pregnancy with depressive symptoms and with inflammatory cytokines in women who were and were not supplemented with omega-3 PUFAs. METHODS: Pregnant women with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores ≥9 were recruited at 12-24 weeks of gestation. The participants were randomly assigned to receive 1800 mg omega-3 fatty acids (containing 1206 mg eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]) or placebo for 12 weeks. E2, omega-3 PUFAs, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and adiponectin were measured at baseline and at the 12-week follow-up. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to examine the association of the changes of E2 and omega-3 PUFAs with the changes in depressive symptoms and with the changes of inflammatory cytokines at follow-up by intervention group. RESULTS: Of the 108 participants in the trial, 100 (92.6%) completed the follow-up assessment including blood sampling. Multivariable regression analyses revealed that the increase of EPA and E2 was significantly associated with a decrease in depressive symptoms among the participants assigned to the omega-3 group, but not among those assigned to the placebo group. Neither E2 nor any PUFAs were associated with a change in inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with EPA and increased levels of E2 during pregnancy might function together to alleviate antenatal depression through a mechanism other than anti-inflammation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nishi D ; Su KP ; Usuda K ; Chang JP ; Hamazaki K ; Ishima T ; Sano Y ; Ito H ; Isaka K ; Tachibana Y ; Tanigaki S ; Suzuki T ; Hashimoto K ; Matsuoka YJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbi.2019.02.014 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid\r\nEstradiol\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nPlasma\r\nPregnancy\r\n*Pregnant Women\r\nRats","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nishi D, Su KP, Usuda K, Chang JP, Hamazaki K, Ishima T, Sano Y, Ito H, Isaka K, Tachibana Y, Tanigaki S, Suzuki T, Hashimoto K, and Matsuoka YJ (2020) Plasma estradiol levels and antidepressant effects of omega-3 fatty acids in pregnant women..

As current treatments are estimated to address only one-third of the disease burden of depressive disorders, there is a need for new approaches to prevent depression or to delay its progression. While in its early stages, converging evidence from laboratory, population research, and clinical trials now suggests that dietary patterns and specific dietary factors may influence the risk for depression. However, largely as a result of the recency of the nutritional psychiatry field, there are currently no dietary recommendations for depression. AIM: The aim of this paper is to provide a set of practical dietary recommendations for the prevention of depression, based on the best available current evidence, in order to inform public health and clinical recommendations. RESULTS: Five key dietary recommendations for the prevention of depression emerged from current published evidence. These comprise: (1) follow 'traditional' dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean, Norwegian, or Japanese diet; (2) increase consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, wholegrain cereals, nuts, and seeds; (3) include a high consumption of foods rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids; (4) replace unhealthy foods with wholesome nutritious foods; (5) limit your intake of processed-foods, 'fast' foods, commercial bakery goods, and sweets. CONCLUSION: Although there are a number of gaps in the scientific literature to date, existing evidence suggests that a combination of healthful dietary practices may reduce the risk of developing depression. It is imperative to remain mindful of any protective effects that are likely to come from the cumulative and synergic effect of nutrients that comprise the whole-diet, rather than from the effects of individual nutrients or single foods. As the body of evidence grows from controlled intervention studies on dietary patterns and depression, these recommendations should be modified accordingly.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Opie RS ; Itsiopoulos C ; Parletta N ; Sanchez-Villegas A ; Akbaraly TN ; Ruusunen A ; Jacka FN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1179/1476830515Y.0000000043 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdolescent Nutritional Physiological Phenomena/ethnology\r\nAdult\r\nAnimals\r\nChild\r\nChild Nutritional Physiological Phenomena/ethnology\r\nChronic Disease/epidemiology/ethnology/prevention & control\r\nComorbidity\r\nDepression/epidemiology/ethnology/etiology/*prevention & control\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/epidemiology/ethnology/etiology/*prevention & control\r\n*Diet, Healthy/ethnology\r\n*Evidence-Based Medicine\r\nFast Foods/adverse effects\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\n*Global Health/ethnology\r\nHumans\r\n*Nutrition Policy\r\nRisk\r\nDepression\r\nDiet\r\nMental disorder\r\nPrevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Opie RS, Itsiopoulos C, Parletta N, Sanchez-Villegas A, Akbaraly TN, Ruusunen A, and Jacka FN (2017) Dietary recommendations for the prevention of depression..

OBJECTIVES: Here we detail the development of the prescribed diet (modified Mediterranean diet (ModiMedDiet)) for individuals with major depressive disorders (MDDs) that was designed specifically for the SMILES trial. We also present data demonstrating the extent to which this intervention achieved improvements in diet quality. METHODS: The ModiMedDiet was designed using a combination of existing dietary guidelines and scientific evidence from the emerging field of nutritional psychiatric epidemiology. Sixty-seven community dwelling individuals (Melbourne, Australia) aged 18 years or over, with current poor quality diets, and MDDs were enrolled into the SMILES trial. A retention rate of 93.9 and 73.5% was observed for the dietary intervention and social support control group, respectively. The dietary intervention (ModiMedDiet) consisted of seven individual nutrition counselling sessions delivered by a qualified dietitian. The control condition comprised a social support protocol matched to the same visit schedule and length. RESULTS: This manuscript details the first prescriptive individualized dietary intervention delivered by dietitians for adults with major depression. Significant improvements in dietary quality were observed among individuals randomized to the ModiMedDiet group. These dietary improvements were also found to be associated with changes in depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The ModiMedDiet, a novel and individually tailored intervention designed specifically for adults with major depression, can be effectively implemented in clinical practice to manage this highly prevalent and debilitating condition.

The aim of this study was to test the hypotheses that in adolescents with depression (a) 12 weeks-supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids results in the attenuation of salivary stress hormone concentrations; (b) the mentioned supplementation improves potentially disrupted daily rhythm of stress hormones; (c) stress hormone concentrations correlate with values of selected markers of oxidative stress. The sample consisted of 60 patients suffering from depression aged 11-18 years. Hormone concentrations in saliva were measured in the morning and midday before (baseline) and after (6, 12 weeks) food supplementation with omega-3 or omega-6 (as comparator) fatty acids. Morning cortisol decreased in response to omega-3 but not omega-6 fatty acids at 12 weeks compared to baseline. No changes were observed in aldosterone concentrations. The obtained results show that adolescent children with depression preserved the daily rhythm of both stress hormones. Baseline morning cortisol concentrations correlated positively with depression severity and lipoperoxides, and negatively with docosahexaenoic acid. Aldosterone concentrations correlated positively with 8-isoprostane. Thus, both hormones showed positive correlation with the selected markers of oxidative stress suggesting that enhanced stress hormone secretion may be associated with increased oxidative tissue damage in adolescent children with depression.

Fish contains high levels of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), and several lines of evidence suggest that the n-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) acts in the brain via anti-apoptotic and neurotrophic pathways. In addition, DHA may act through anti-neuroinflammatory pathways, as DHA possesses anti-inflammatory properties in the periphery. Evidence from animal models has indicated that DHA and its derivatives (resolvin D1 and protectin D1) attenuate colitis, peritonitis and ischemic stroke. n-3 PUFA deprivation in rats decreases brain levels of DHA and increases markers of the brain arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) cascade, a proinflammatory pathway. Thus, chronic low intake of n-3 PUFA may predispose the brain to weak anti-inflammatory, as well as strong proinflammatory signals. Neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and major depression, display a neuroinflammatory component. n-3 PUFA supplementation, as well as drugs targeting brain PUFA metabolism, are promising candidates in the prevention and treatment of neurological disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Orr SK ; Bazinet RP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Anti-Inflammatory Agents\r\nArachidonic Acid/metabolism\r\nBrain Chemistry\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nNeuritis/*drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Orr SK, and Bazinet RP (2008) The emerging role of docosahexaenoic acid in neuroinflammation..

Five databases (PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL and The Cochrane Database) were searched for RCT in this area published up to April 2011. The selected studies all involved human participants and included a comparison group. Thirty eight studies were identified, which examined the influence of n-3 PUFA supplementation on the prevention/treatment of depression (non-perinatal) (n 23), perinatal depression (n 6) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (n 9). Great heterogeneity was noticed in terms of study design, the doses of n-3 PUFA administered, and study duration. Some benefit was noted with respect to the treatment of hyperactivity and depression in over half the examined studies, although the evidence was not conclusive. For any firm conclusions to be drawn, further studies will be needed that take into account the initial n-3 PUFA status of the subjects. Excessive n-3 PUFA intakes might be associated with a greater risk of peroxidation events and therefore neuropsychiatric deterioration. Indeed, some studies only recorded benefits when lower doses were administered. It is therefore important that the dose required to achieve any potential benefit be determined.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ortega RM ; Rodríguez-Rodríguez E ; López-Sobaler AM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S000711451200164X ","Keywords":"Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*drug therapy\r\nBehavior/*drug effects\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/prevention & control\r\nDepression, Postpartum/drug therapy/prevention & control\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/prevention & control\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ortega RM, Rodríguez-Rodríguez E, and López-Sobaler AM (2012) Effects of omega 3 fatty acids supplementation in behavior and non-neurodegenerative neuropsychiatric disorders..

This complex entity is the result of the interplay between biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors, and compelling evidence suggests that MDD can be considered a disease that occurs as a consequence of an evolutionary mismatch and unhealthy lifestyle habits. In this context, diet is one of the core pillars of health, influencing multiple biological processes in the brain and the entire body. It seems that there is a bidirectional relationship between MDD and malnutrition, and depressed individuals often lack certain critical nutrients along with an aberrant dietary pattern. Thus, dietary interventions are one of the most promising tools to explore in the field of MDD, as there are a specific group of nutrients (i.e., omega 3, vitamins, polyphenols, and caffeine), foods (fish, nuts, seeds fruits, vegetables, coffee/tea, and fermented products) or dietary supplements (such as S-adenosylmethionine, acetyl carnitine, creatine, amino acids, etc.), which are being currently studied. Likewise, the entire nutritional context and the dietary pattern seem to be another potential area of study, and some strategies such as the Mediterranean diet have demonstrated some relevant benefits in patients with MDD; although, further efforts are still needed. In the present work, we will explore the state-of-the-art diet in the prevention and clinical support of MDD, focusing on the biological properties of its main nutrients, foods, and dietary patterns and their possible implications for these patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ortega MA ; Fraile-Martínez Ó ; García-Montero C ; Alvarez-Mon MA ; Lahera G ; Monserrat J ; Llavero-Valero M ; Gutiérrez-Rojas L ; Molina R ; Rodríguez-Jimenez R ; Quintero J ; De Mon MA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu14153099 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/prevention & control\r\nDiet\r\n*Diet, Mediterranean\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3\r\nHumans\r\nVegetables\r\nVitamins\r\ndietary interventions\r\nmajor depressive disorder (MDD)\r\nomega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids\r\npolyphenols","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ortega MA, Fraile-Martínez Ó, García-Montero C, Alvarez-Mon MA, Lahera G, Monserrat J, Llavero-Valero M, Gutiérrez-Rojas L, Molina R, Rodríguez-Jimenez R, Quintero J, and De Mon MA (2022) Biological Role of Nutrients, Food and Dietary Patterns in the Prevention and Clinical Management of Major Depressive Disorder..

The second study used omega-3 fatty acids in childhood major depression; 28 children aged 6-12 were randomized to omega-3 fatty acids or placebo as pharmacologic monotherapy. The third study was an open-label add-on trial of EPA in bipolar depression. Twelve bipolar outpatients with depressive symptoms were treated with 1.5-2.0 g/day of EPA for up to 6 months. In the adult unipolar depression study, highly significant benefits were found by week 3 of EPA treatment compared with placebo. In the child study, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed highly significant effects of omega-3 on each of the three rating scales. In the bipolar depression study, 8 of the 10 patients who completed at least 1 month of follow-up achieved a 50% or greater reduction in Hamilton depression (Ham-D) scores within 1 month. No significant side effects were reported in any of the studies. Omega-3 fatty acids were shown to be more effective than placebo for depression in both adults and children in small controlled studies and in an open study of bipolar depression.

Social defeat stress (SDS) is a well-known rodent model of human psychosocial stress, and animals exposed to SDS show social avoidance behavior. Fish oil, which is rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), is expected to decrease the risk of depressive disorders. In this study, we determined whether fish oil affects the social behavior of SDS-exposed mice and measured serotonin levels and expression of genes related to tryptophan (TRP) metabolism in the hippocampus. The experimental animals were fed a diet containing fish oil during SDS exposure. For the fish oil treatment, experimental mice were fed a diet containing fish oil at low (L-FO), middle (M-FO), and high (H-FO) concentrations. The control group was supplemented with an equivalent amount of canola oil (no fish oil: N-FO). After the SDS protocol, we performed a social interaction test and assessed the sociality of experimental mice. In the N-FO group, SDS-exposed mice showed negative social interactions compared with non-stressed mice. The L-FO and H-FO groups showed negative social interactions after SDS exposure; however, the M-FO group did not exhibit negative social behavior. The serotonin levels of SDS-exposed mice were lower than those of non-stressed mice in the N-FO group. In contrast with these results in the N-FO group, there was no difference in serotonin levels between SDS-exposed and non-stressed mice in the FO groups. In addition, the expression of genes related to TRP metabolism in SDS-exposed mice increased in the N-FO group, but not in the FO group.

This article examines recent evidence for this association. RECENT FINDINGS: During the past year our understanding of the effect of omega-3 depletion on the structure and function of the brain has been furthered by research examining human brain tissue and by studies utilizing animal models of depression. Human and animal research has also provided further evidence for omega-3 affecting mood via its anti-inflammatory effects. Previous clinical trials indicated that omega-3 can be effective as an adjunctive treatment for those with treatment-resistant depression. More recent clinical trial data indicate that omega-3 may also be an effective monotherapy for childhood depression and for depressed mood in patients who engage in recurrent self-harm. The recent clinical trial data regarding omega-3 as a treatment for bipolar disorder are inconclusive, however, and clinical trials in postnatal depression are still lacking.

Many pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options are available to help patients with cancer manage anxiety. OBJECTIVES: This randomized, controlled trial examined the effects of lavender oil aromatherapy on anxiety and sleep quality in patients undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: 70 patients were randomly assigned to a lavender oil group, a tea tree oil group, and a control group with no oil. A patient identification form, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Pittsburgh Quality Sleep Index (PSQI) were used to measure anxiety and sleep quality before and after chemotherapy. FINDINGS: State anxiety before and after chemotherapy did not vary among groups. The authors compared trait anxiety values before and after chemotherapy and found a significant difference in the lavender group. In addition, a significant change in PSQI measurements before and after chemotherapy was observed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ozkaraman A ; Dügüm Ö ; Özen Yılmaz H; Usta Yesilbalkan Ö; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1188/18.CJON.203-210 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAntineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects\r\nAnxiety/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nAromatherapy/*methods\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLavandula/chemistry\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNeoplasms/*drug therapy\r\nOils, Volatile/*therapeutic use\r\nPlant Oils/*therapeutic use\r\nSleep Wake Disorders/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nTea Tree Oil/*therapeutic use\r\nPSQI\r\nSTAI\r\nanxiety\r\naromatherapy\r\nchemotherapy\r\nlavender\r\nsleep quality","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ozkaraman A, Dügüm Ö, Özen Yılmaz H, and Usta Yesilbalkan Ö (2018) Aromatherapy: The Effect of Lavender on Anxiety and Sleep Quality in Patients Treated With Chemotherapy..

Here we present our results of the secondary outcomes: the levels of thromboxane (TXB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), homocysteine (HCy) and vitamin D. Fifty-eight patients were randomized into two arms. One group received a fish oil emulsion enriched with omega-3 FA, and the other received a sunflower oil emulsion containing omega-6 FA, for 12 weeks. Depressive symptoms were evaluated, using the Child's Depressive Inventory (CDI). The patients with DD had elevated TXB levels and decreased vitamin D levels, as compared to healthy controls. Both CDI and omega-6/omega-3 ratio correlated positively with TXB and negatively with BDNF at baseline. Compared to the omega-6 FA group, the supplementation with omega-3 FA for 12 weeks significantly reduced plasma TXB (p = 0.024) and increased BDNF (p = 0.011) levels. No changes in HCy and vitamin D were observed. Our results demonstrate the possible role of TXB and BDNF in the pathophysiology of DD and the benefits of omega-3 FA supplementation.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Homes and nursing homes in the Mugello area, Florence, Italy. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects aged 90-99 years [N=388 (271F; 117M) mean age: 92.7±3.1]. MEASUREMENTS: All subjects were evaluated through questionnaires and instrumental examinations. Adherence to MD was assessed through the Mediterranean Diet Score. A shorter version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used to detect the possible presence of depressive symptoms. In addition, cognitive and functional status was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Clock Drawing Test, as well as the Basic and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living test. RESULTS: Depressed subjects (DS) (GDS score≥5, 43.8%) were older, females and widows, than non-depressed subjects (NDS). DS reported a slightly but not statistically significant lower MD score than NDS (33.9±3.9 vs. 34.6±3.3, p=0.149). Subjects who reported to consume a greater amount of olive oil and fruit were associated with a lower risk of depression (OR=0.35, 95%CI=0.20-0.59, p<0.001 and OR=0.46, 95%CI=0.26-0.84, p=0.011, respectively) after adjustment for many possible confounders. Similar results were obtained for women, while no statistically significant differences emerged for men. CONCLUSION: Our results support the hypothesis that a diet rich in olive oil and fruit, characteristics of MD, may protect against the development of depressive symptoms in older age.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pagliai G ; Sofi F ; Vannetti F ; Caiani S ; Pasquini G ; Molino Lova R; Cecchi F ; Sorbi S ; Macchi C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s12603-018-1019-3 ","Keywords":"Activities of Daily Living\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/*diet therapy/*psychology\r\nDepressive Disorder/*diet therapy/*psychology\r\nDiet, Mediterranean/*psychology\r\nFeeding Behavior/psychology\r\nFemale\r\nFruit\r\nHumans\r\nItaly\r\nMale\r\nNeuropsychological Tests\r\nNursing Homes\r\nNutritional Status\r\nOlive Oil\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nNutrition\r\nfood\r\nfruits\r\nlongevity\r\nolive oil","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pagliai G, Sofi F, Vannetti F, Caiani S, Pasquini G, Molino Lova R, Cecchi F, Sorbi S, and Macchi C (2018) Mediterranean Diet, Food Consumption and Risk of Late-Life Depression: The Mugello Study..

Eighty-eight controls without a chronic disease were matched to the cases for age and sex. RESULTS: Multivariate-adjusted regression analysis showed that the risk of depression was significantly and negatively associated with erythrocyte levels of 20:5 n-3, 22:6 n-3, 16:0 and 18:0, but positively associated with erythrocyte levels of 18:2t and 16:1 after adjusting for confounding factors. In addition, the risk of depression was negatively associated with the intake of energy, carbohydrate, seafood and grains, but positively with the intake of fat and meat after adjustment for confounding factors.

The present study aimed to examine the behavioral effects and antidepressant mechanism of n-3 PUFA using a forced swimming test. Eleven-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed an American Institute of Nutrition-93M diet containing 0%, 0.5% or 1% EPA and DHA relative to the total energy intake in their diet for 12 weeks (n=8 per group). Total dietary intake, body weight and hippocampus weights were not significantly different among groups. The groups administered 0.5% and 1% EPA+DHA diets had significantly higher levels of n-3 PUFA in their brain phospholipids compared to those in the control group. The immobility time was significantly decreased and the climbing time was significantly increased in the 0.5% and 1% EPA+DHA groups compared with those in the 0% EPA+DHA group. Plasma serotonin concentration and hippocampus c-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) expression were significantly increased in the 0.5% and 1% EPA+DHA groups compared with those in the 0% EPA+DHA group. Conversely, interleukin (IL)-6 expression was significantly reduced in the 0.5% and 1% EPA+DHA groups compared with that in the 0% EPA+DHA group.

This study investigated the effects of essential oil from Asarum heterotropoides (EOAH) on depression-like behaviors and brain expressions of CRF, 5-HT, and TH in mice challenged with stress. METHODS: Male ICR mice received fragrance inhalation of EOAH (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g) for 3 h in the special cage capped with a filter paper before start of the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). The duration of immobility was measured for the determination of depression-like behavior in the FST and TST. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine as positive control was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg (i.p.) 30 min before start of behavioral testing. Immunoreactivities of CRF, 5-HT, and TH in the brain were also measured using separate groups of mice subjected to the FST. RESULTS: EOAH at higher doses (1.0 and 2.0 g) reduced immobility time in the FST and TST. In addition, EOAH at a dose of 1.0 g significantly reduced the expected increases in the expression of CRF positive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus and the expression of TH positive neurons in the locus coeruleus, and the expected decreases of the 5-HT positive neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. CONCLUSION: These results provide strong evidence that EOAH effectively inhibits depression-like behavioral responses, brain CRF and TH expression increases, and brain 5-HT expression decreases in mice challenged with stress.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Park HJ ; Lim EJ ; Zhao RJ ; Oh SR ; Jung JW ; Ahn EM ; Lee ES ; Koo JS ; Kim HY ; Chang S ; Shim HS ; Kim KJ ; Gwak YS ; Yang CH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12906-015-0571-1 ","Keywords":"Administration, Inhalation\r\nAnimals\r\nAnti-Anxiety Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety/drug therapy\r\n*Aromatherapy\r\nAsarum/*chemistry\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nBrain/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nCorticotropin-Releasing Hormone/metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy/etiology\r\nHindlimb Suspension\r\nMale\r\nMice, Inbred ICR\r\nOils, Volatile/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nReceptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A/metabolism\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nStress, Psychological/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nSwimming\r\nTyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Park HJ, Lim EJ, Zhao RJ, Oh SR, Jung JW, Ahn EM, Lee ES, Koo JS, Kim HY, Chang S, Shim HS, Kim KJ, Gwak YS, and Yang CH (2015) Effect of the fragrance inhalation of essential oil from Asarum heterotropoides on depression-like behaviors in mice..

METHOD: Relevant published studies are detailed and considered. RESULTS: Several epidemiological studies suggest covariation between seafood consumption and rates of mood disorders. Biological marker studies indicate deficits in omega-3 fatty acids in people with depressive disorders, while several treatment studies indicate therapeutic benefits from omega-3 supplementation. A similar contribution of omega-3 fatty acids to coronary artery disease may explain the well-described links between coronary artery disease and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Deficits in omega-3 fatty acids have been identified as a contributing factor to mood disorders and offer a potential rational treatment approach. This review identifies a number of hypotheses and studies for consideration. In particular, the authors argue for studies clarifying the efficacy of omega-3 supplementation for unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders, both as individual and augmentation treatment strategies, and for studies pursuing which omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is likely to provide the greatest benefit.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Parker G ; Gibson NA ; Brotchie H ; Heruc G ; Rees AM ; Hadzi-Pavlovic D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/ajp.2006.163.6.969 ","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/diet therapy/metabolism\r\nCardiovascular Diseases/etiology/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/diet therapy/metabolism\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/therapeutic use\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/*metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMalnutrition/diet therapy/metabolism\r\nMood Disorders/*diet therapy/etiology/*metabolism\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Parker G, Gibson NA, Brotchie H, Heruc G, Rees AM, and Hadzi-Pavlovic D (2006) Omega-3 fatty acids and mood disorders..

METHODS: Adults with self-reported depression were randomized to receive fortnightly food hampers and MedDiet cooking workshops for 3 months and fish oil supplements for 6 months, or attend social groups fortnightly for 3 months. Assessments at baseline, 3 and 6 months included mental health, quality of life (QoL) and dietary questionnaires, and blood samples for erythrocyte fatty acid analysis. RESULTS: n = 152 eligible adults aged 18-65 were recruited (n = 95 completed 3-month and n = 85 completed 6-month assessments). At 3 months, the MedDiet group had a higher MedDiet score (t = 3.95, P < 0.01), consumed more vegetables (t = 3.95, P < 0.01), fruit (t = 2.10, P = 0.04), nuts (t = 2.29, P = 0.02), legumes (t = 2.41, P = 0.02) wholegrains (t = 2.63, P = 0.01), and vegetable diversity (t = 3.27, P < 0.01); less unhealthy snacks (t = -2.10, P = 0.04) and red meat/chicken (t = -2.13, P = 0.04). The MedDiet group had greater reduction in depression (t = -2.24, P = 0.03) and improved mental health QoL scores (t = 2.10, P = 0.04) at 3 months. Improved diet and mental health were sustained at 6 months. Reduced depression was correlated with an increased MedDiet score (r = -0.298, P = 0.01), nuts (r = -0.264, P = 0.01), and vegetable diversity (r = -0.303, P = 0.01). Other mental health improvements had similar correlations, most notably for increased vegetable diversity and legumes. There were some correlations between increased omega-3, decreased omega-6 and improved mental health. DISCUSSION: This is one of the first randomized controlled trials to show that healthy dietary changes are achievable and, supplemented with fish oil, can improve mental health in people with depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Parletta N ; Zarnowiecki D ; Cho J ; Wilson A ; Bogomolova S ; Villani A ; Itsiopoulos C ; Niyonsenga T ; Blunden S ; Meyer B ; Segal L ; Baune BT ; O'Dea K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/1028415X.2017.1411320 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nDepression/blood/*diet therapy/*psychology\r\n*Diet, Mediterranean\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/blood\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-6/blood\r\nFemale\r\nFish Oils/*administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\n*Mental Health\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nQuality of Life\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult\r\nDepression\r\nFish oil\r\nIntervention\r\nMediterranean diet\r\nMental health\r\nOmega-3\r\nOmega-6\r\nQuality of life","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Parletta N, Zarnowiecki D, Cho J, Wilson A, Bogomolova S, Villani A, Itsiopoulos C, Niyonsenga T, Blunden S, Meyer B, Segal L, Baune BT, and O'Dea K (2019) A Mediterranean-style dietary intervention supplemented with fish oil improves diet quality and mental health in people with depression: A randomized controlled trial (HELFIMED)..

Depression related naturally occurring cell death (apoptosis) is thought to be mediated by excitotoxicity and free radicals that appear in the brain immediately following any inflammatory or ischemic damage, and increases the likelihood of clinically defined depression.

In non-stroke populations, successful management of such disorders and symptoms has been reported following diet supplementation with long chain omega-3-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids (PUFAs). However, the potential protective effects of PUFA supplementation on affective behaviors after experimentally induced stroke and sham surgery have not been examined previously. This study investigated the behavioral effects of PUFA supplementation over a 6-week period following either middle cerebral artery occlusion or sham surgery in the hooded-Wistar rat. The PUFA diet supplied during the acclimation period prior to surgery was found to be associated with an increased risk of acute hemorrhage following the reperfusion component of the surgery. In surviving animals, PUFA supplementation did not influence infarct size as determined 6 weeks after surgery, but did decrease omega-6-fatty-acid levels, moderate sickness behaviors, acute motor impairment, and longer-term locomotor hyperactivity and depression/anxiety-like behavior.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pascoe MC ; Howells DW ; Crewther DP ; Constantinou N ; Carey LM ; Rewell SS ; Turchini GM ; Kaur G ; Crewther SG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fneur.2014.00014 ","Keywords":"middle-cerebral-artery-occlusion\r\nmood\r\npolyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nstroke","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pascoe MC, Howells DW, Crewther DP, Constantinou N, Carey LM, Rewell SS, Turchini GM, Kaur G, and Crewther SG (2014) Fish oil diet associated with acute reperfusion related hemorrhage, and with reduced stroke-related sickness behaviors and motor impairment..

Here, we synthesize previous findings that serotonin regulates executive function, sensory gating, and social behavior and that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and impulsive behavior all share in common defects in these functions. It has remained unclear why supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D improve cognitive function and behavior in these brain disorders. Here, we propose mechanisms by which serotonin synthesis, release, and function in the brain are modulated by vitamin D and the 2 marine omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Brain serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase 2, which is transcriptionally activated by vitamin D hormone. Inadequate levels of vitamin D (∼70% of the population) and omega-3 fatty acids are common, suggesting that brain serotonin synthesis is not optimal. We propose mechanisms by which EPA increases serotonin release from presynaptic neurons by reducing E2 series prostaglandins and DHA influences serotonin receptor action by increasing cell membrane fluidity in postsynaptic neurons. We propose a model whereby insufficient levels of vitamin D, EPA, or DHA, in combination with genetic factors and at key periods during development, would lead to dysfunctional serotonin activation and function and may be one underlying mechanism that contributes to neuropsychiatric disorders and depression. This model suggests that optimizing vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acid intake may help prevent and modulate the severity of brain dysfunction.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Patrick RP ; Ames BN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1096/fj.14-268342 ","Keywords":"Attention Deficit Disorder with \r\n      Hyperactivity/metabolism/physiopathology/prevention & control\r\nBipolar Disorder/metabolism/physiopathology/prevention & control\r\nBrain/drug effects/*metabolism/physiopathology\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/*metabolism/pharmacology\r\nHumans\r\nImpulsive Behavior/drug effects/physiology\r\nSchizophrenia/metabolism/physiopathology/prevention & control\r\nSerotonin/*biosynthesis\r\nVitamin D/administration & dosage/*metabolism/pharmacology\r\nVitamins/administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacology\r\ndocahexaenoic acid\r\neicosapentaenoic acid\r\nmental illness","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Patrick RP, and Ames BN (2015) Vitamin D and the omega-3 fatty acids control serotonin synthesis and action, part 2: relevance for ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and impulsive behavior..

Fish oil (FO), composed mostly of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), has been pointed out as quite promising for the treatment of depression given its neuroprotective property. Although DHA and EPA exert several physiological actions, DHA is known to play a critical role in postnatal brain development. This study aimed to investigate the effect of preventive treatment with FO (with more DHA in the composition) alone or associated with antidepressant drugs on depression-like behaviors and brain monoamines levels of juvenile induced-T1DM rats. Thus, prepubescent rats were submitted to a prolonged treatment with vehicle (VEH) or FO (50% of DHA and 20% EPA) starting 4 weeks before the induction of experimental T1DM (on day 28) by streptozotocin. When combined, the treatment with vehicle, fluoxetine (FLX, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or imipramine (IMI, a tricyclic antidepressant) started at week 6 (day 42) and lasted for 2 weeks (until day 56). The behavioral tests were conducted on days 55 and 56, followed by hippocampal and prefrontal cortex dissection for neurochemical analyses. Our results showed that induced-T1DM rats pretreated with FO showed a significant increase of EPA and DHA in plasma, indicative of an increase in the systemic availability of these acids. As previously observed, induced-T1DM rats presented increased immobility and decreased swimming and climbing frequencies in the modified forced swimming test, indicative of depressive-like behavior. Only the combined treatment - FO plus antidepressants (FLX or IMI - both in the highest dose) - was able to induce a significant improvement of depressive-like behaviors. Here, it is noteworthy that swimming behavior has been associated with an increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. Interestingly, our data showed that the combined treatment (FO + antidepressants - including the ineffective dose of FLX) was able to increase the swimming of animals more significantly compared to animals not pretreated with FO. In addition, confirming these assumptions, the decreased 5-HT levels in the hippocampus from induced-T1DM rats were increased after treatment with FLX (highest dose) or IMI (both doses), being this increase more pronounced in animal pretreated with FO. Intriguingly, in these animals pretreated with FO, the ineffective dose of FLX in association with FO was able to increase the levels of 5-HT. The decreased hippocampal levels of noradrenaline were increased only after IMI treatment, not being influenced by FO pretreatment. In conclusion, ours results pointed out that the choice of the DHA/EPA ratio may be an important factor to be considered for the FO antidepressant-like effectper se,but the FO treatment in this composition associated with the antidepressant drugs - especially that ones that increase preferentially the availability of 5-HT -, may represent a better alternative of treatment to individuals with T1DM-associated depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Paula Farias Waltrick A; Henrique Bernardo de Lima Silva A; Cristina de Carvalho M; Aparecida Comotti de Oliveira B; Naliwaiko K ; Maria da Cunha J; Menezes Zanoveli J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neulet.2022.136477 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1/complications/drug therapy/*prevention & \r\n      control/psychology\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nFish Oils/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSerotonin/*metabolism\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression\r\nDocosahexaenoic acid\r\nEicosapentaenoic acid\r\nOmega-3 fatty acids\r\nSerotonin\r\nStreptozotocin","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Paula Farias Waltrick A, Henrique Bernardo de Lima Silva A, Cristina de Carvalho M, Aparecida Comotti de Oliveira B, Naliwaiko K, Maria da Cunha J, and Menezes Zanoveli J (2022) Preventive treatment with fish oil facilitates the antidepressant-like effect of antidepressant drugs in type-1 diabetes mellitus rats: Implication of serotonergic system..

OBJECTIVES: A randomized placebo-controlled study was designed to compare the efficacy of a 26-week intervention composed of either 2.2 g/day of n-3 PUFA or olive oil placebo, with regard to symptom severity in first-episode schizophrenia patients. The secondary outcome measure of the study was to describe the association between n-3 PUFA clinical effect and changes in peripheral BDNF levels. METHODS: Seventy-one patients aged 16-35 were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to the following study arms: 36 to the EPA + DHA group and 35 to the placebo group. Plasma BDNF levels were assessed three times, at baseline and at weeks 8 and 26 of the intervention. BDNF levels were determined in plasma samples using Quantikine Human BDNF ELISA kit. Plasma BDNF level changes were further correlated with changes in the severity of symptoms in different clinical domains. RESULTS: A significantly greater increase in plasma BDNF levels was observed in the intervention compared to the placebo group (Cohen's d = 1.54). Changes of BDNF levels inversely correlated with change in depressive symptoms assessed using the Calgary Depression Rating Scale in Schizophrenia (Pearson's r = - 0.195; p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of a six-month intervention with n-3 PUFA observed in first-episode schizophrenia may be related to an increase in BDNF levels, which may be triggered by the activation of intracellular signaling pathways including transcription factors such as cAMP-reactive element binding protein.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pawełczyk T ; Grancow-Grabka M ; Trafalska E ; Szemraj J ; Żurner N ; Pawełczyk A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00213-019-05258-4 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nBiomarkers/blood\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*blood\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nOlive Oil/therapeutic use\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSchizophrenia/*blood/*drug therapy\r\n*Schizophrenic Psychology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult\r\nBrain-derived neurotrophic factor\r\nFatty acid\r\nNeuroprotection\r\nRandomized clinical trial\r\nSupplementation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pawełczyk T, Grancow-Grabka M, Trafalska E, Szemraj J, Żurner N, and Pawełczyk A (2019) An increase in plasma brain derived neurotrophic factor levels is related to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid efficacy in first episode schizophrenia: secondary outcome analysis of the OFFER randomized clinical trial..

One clear change in the diet of the population in developed countries has been the replacement of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids by saturated fats and trans-fats as well as by omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are essential fatty acids, and the members of the -3 and -6 series are crucial for human health. In biochemical processes there is a competition between these two series. A higher dietary intake of omega-6 results in the excessive incorporation of these molecules in the cell membrane with numerous pathological consequences, presumably due to the formation of proinflammatory eicosanoids. Members of the omega-3 family and their derivatives modulate the inflammatory action. Essential fatty acids play a major role in brain development and brain functioning. The omega-3 series members docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) provide fluidity to the cell membrane, facilitating certain processes including neurotransmission and ion channel flow. It is thought that omega-3 deficiency during the fetal and postnatal period may have a long-term effect at various levels. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a positive association between omega-3 deficits and mood disorders. As for treatment, there is convincing evidence that add-on omega-3 fatty acids to standard antidepressant pharmacotherapy results in improved mood. There is no evidence that fatty acid monotherapy has a mood-elevating effect, with a possible exception for childhood depression. There are indications that omega-3 has a prophylactic effect on perinatal depression and has a negative effect on natural killer cell activity and T-lymphocyte function. These observations need further study in view of the popularity of self-medication.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pawels EK ; Volterrani D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1358/dnp.2008.21.8.1272136 ","Keywords":"Brain/physiology\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nFatty Acids, Essential/administration & dosage/physiology/*therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/physiology/*therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-6/*administration & dosage/physiology/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMood Disorders/*diet therapy/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pawels EK, and Volterrani D (2008) Fatty acid facts, Part I.

We tested the antidepressive effect of ethyl-eicosapentaenoate in these patients. METHODS: We included 70 patients with persistant depression despite ongoing treatment with an adequate dose of a standard antidepressant. Patients were randomized on a double-blind basis to placebo or ethyl-eicosapentaenoate at dosages of 1, 2, or 4 g/d for 12 weeks in addition to unchanged background medication. Patients underwent assessment using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory. RESULTS: Forty-six (88%) of 52 patients receiving ethyl-eicosapentaenoate and 14 (78%) of 18 patients receiving placebo completed the 12-week study with no serious adverse events. The 1-g/d group showed a significantly better outcome than the placebo group on all 3 rating scales. In the intention-to-treat group, 5 (29%) of 17 patients receiving placebo and 9 (53%) of 17 patients receiving 1 g/d of ethyl-eicosapentaenoate achieved a 50% reduction on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score. In the per-protocol group, the corresponding figures were 3 (25%) of 12 patients for placebo and 9 (69%) of 13 patients for the 1-g/d group. The 2-g/d group showed little evidence of efficacy, whereas the 4-g/d group showed nonsignificant trends toward improvement. All of the individual items on all 3 rating scales improved with the 1-g/d dosage of ethyl-eicosapentaenoate vs placebo, with strong beneficial effects on items rating depression, anxiety, sleep, lassitude, libido, and suicidality. CONCLUSION: Treatment with ethyl-eicosapentaenoate at a dosage of 1 g/d was effective in treating depression in patients who remained depressed despite adequate standard therapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Peet M ; Horrobin DF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1001/archpsyc.59.10.913 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/administration & dosage/*analogs & \r\n      derivatives/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPersonality Inventory\r\nPlacebos\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Peet M, and Horrobin DF (2002) A dose-ranging study of the effects of ethyl-eicosapentaenoate in patients with ongoing depression despite apparently adequate treatment with standard drugs..

Four out of five placebo-controlled double- blind trials of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in the treatment of schizophrenia have given positive findings. In depression, two placebo-controlled trials have shown a strong therapeutic effect of ethyl-EPA added to existing medication. The mode of action of EPA is currently not known, but recent evidence suggests that arachidonic acid (AA) if of particular importance in schizophrenia and that clinical improvement in schizophrenic patients using EPA treatment correlates with changes in AA.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Peet M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.plefa.2003.08.020 ","Keywords":"Antipsychotic Agents/metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/metabolism/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nPhospholipids/metabolism\r\nPlacebos\r\nSchizophrenia/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Peet M (2003) Eicosapentaenoic acid in the treatment of schizophrenia and depression: rationale and preliminary double-blind clinical trial results..

The two main omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have important biological functions in the CNS. DHA is a major structural component of neuronal membranes, and changing the fatty acid composition of neuronal membranes leads to functional changes in the activity of receptors and other proteins embedded in the membrane phospholipid. EPA has important physiological functions that can affect neuronal activity. Epidemiological studies indicate an association between depression and low dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids, and biochemical studies have shown reduced levels of omega-3 fatty acids in red blood cell membranes in both depressive and schizophrenic patients. Five of six double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in schizophrenia, and four of six such trials in depression, have reported therapeutic benefit from omega-3 fatty acids in either the primary or secondary statistical analysis, particularly when EPA is added on to existing psychotropic medication. Individual clinical trials have suggested benefits of EPA treatment in borderline personality disorder and of combined omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The evidence to date supports the adjunctive use of omega-3 fatty acids in the management of treatment unresponsive depression and schizophrenia. As these conditions are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus, omega-3 fatty acids should also benefit the physical state of these patients. However, as the clinical research evidence is preliminary, large, and definitive randomised controlled trials similar to those required for the licensing of any new pharmacological treatment are needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Peet M ; Stokes C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2165/00003495-200565080-00002 ","Keywords":"Clinical Trials as Topic\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/chemistry/classification/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/*drug therapy/epidemiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Peet M, and Stokes C (2005) Omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of psychiatric disorders..

However, possible mechanisms remain unclear. Here, a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced model of depression was used to compare EPA and DHA anti-depressant effects. After EPA or DHA feeding, depression-like behavior, brain n-3/n-6 PUFAs profile, serum corticosterone and cholesterol concentration, hippocampal neurotransmitters, microglial and astrocyte related function, as well as neuronal apoptosis and survival signaling pathways were studied. EPA was more effective than DHA to ameliorate CUMS-induced body weight loss, and depression-like behaviors, such as increasing sucrose preference, shortening immobility time and increasing locomotor activity. CUMS-induced corticosterone elevation was reversed by bother fatty acids, while increased cholesterol was only reduced by EPA supplement. Lower hippocampal noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations in CUMS rats were also reversed by both EPA and DHA supplement. However, even though CUMS-induced microglial activation and associated increased IL-1β were inhibited by both EPA and DHA supplement, increased IL-6 and TNF-α levels were only reduced by EPA. Compared to DHA, EPA could improve CUMS-induced suppressive astrocyte biomarkers and associated BDNF-TrkB signaling. Moreover, EPA was more effective than DHA to attenuate CUMS-induced higher hippocampal NGF, GDNF, NF-κB, p38, p75, and bax expressions, but reversed bcl-2 reduction. This study for the first time revealed the mechanisms by which EPA was more powerful than DHA in anti-inflammation, normalizing astrocyte and neurotrophin function and regulating NF-κB, p38 and apoptosis signaling. These findings reveal the different mechanisms of EPA and DHA in clinical depression treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Peng Z ; Zhang C ; Yan L ; Zhang Y ; Yang Z ; Wang J ; Song C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ijms21051769 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Apoptosis\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/*pharmacology\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology\r\nFemale\r\nHippocampus/*drug effects/pathology\r\nNeuroglia/*drug effects/pathology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nStress, Psychological/*complications\r\nBDNF\r\nDHA\r\nEPA\r\nastrocytes\r\ndepression\r\nmicroglia\r\nneuroinflammation\r\nneurotrophins","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Peng Z, Zhang C, Yan L, Zhang Y, Yang Z, Wang J, and Song C (2020) EPA is More Effective than DHA to Improve Depression-Like Behavior, Glia Cell Dysfunction and Hippcampal Apoptosis Signaling in a Chronic Stress-Induced Rat Model of Depression..

Here we applied the metabolomic technique to investigate the potential involvement of FO metabolites in ameliorating depressive-like behaviors in LPS-injected mice. It revealed that LPS-injection stimulated systemic inflammation, exhausted the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) level in the brain, decreased energy metabolism and impaired neuronal function, which collectively contributed to depressive-like behaviors in mice. FO treatment enhanced the production of neuroprotective metabolites including taurine, hypotaurine and tyramine, decreased the generation of neurotoxic agents such as ADPR, glutamate accumulation and oxidized glutathione, and prevented the NAD exhaustion in the brain, which might underlie the beneficial effects of FO against LPS-induced inflammation and depressive-like behaviors.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Peng Y ; Shi Z ; Kumaran Satyanarayanan S; He C ; Li P ; Wan JB ; Su H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbi.2020.09.005 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nDepression/chemically induced/drug therapy\r\n*Fish Oils\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System\r\nInflammation/chemically induced/drug therapy\r\n*Lipopolysaccharides\r\nMice\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System\r\nDepression\r\nMetabolomics\r\nMolecular pathways\r\nNeuroinflammation\r\nSystemic inflammation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Peng Y, Shi Z, Kumaran Satyanarayanan S, He C, Li P, Wan JB, and Su H (2020) Fish oil alleviates LPS-induced inflammation and depressive-like behavior in mice via restoration of metabolic impairments..

Whether n-3 PUFA supplementation improves dendritic morphology, synaptic transmission, and memory of chronically stressed rats remains unknown. In this work, we randomly assigned male Sprague-Dawley rats in four experimental groups: two unsupplemented groups, control and stress, and two supplemented groups with n-3 PUFA (DHA and EPA mix), control + n-3 PUFA and stress + n-3 PUFA. Dendritic morphology and synaptic transmission in the hippocampus were evaluated by Golgi stain and patch-clamp tools, respectively. The Y-maze and Morris water maze were used to analyze the effects of chronic stress on memory. Supplementation with n-3 PUFA improved dendritic architecture and restored the frequency of inhibitory post-synaptic currents of hippocampal pyramidal neurons of rats from stress group. In addition, n-3 PUFA supplementation improved spatial memory. Our results demonstrate that n-3 PUFA supplementation had three beneficial effects on stressed rats: prevented or compensated dendritic atrophy in CA3; restored the probability of GABA release in CA1; and improved spatial memory. We argue that n-3 PUFA supplementation can be used in treating stress-related psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pérez MÁ ; Peñaloza-Sancho V ; Ahumada J ; Fuenzalida M ; Dagnino-Subiabre A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/1028415X.2017.1323609 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/therapeutic use\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nExploratory Behavior\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nFish Oils/therapeutic use\r\nGABAergic Neurons/*metabolism\r\nHippocampus/*metabolism\r\nLearning Disabilities/etiology/prevention & control\r\nMale\r\nMaze Learning\r\nMemory Disorders/etiology/prevention & control\r\nNootropic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nRestraint, Physical/adverse effects/psychology\r\nSpatial Memory\r\n*Stress, Physiological\r\nStress, Psychological/etiology/metabolism/physiopathology/*prevention & control\r\nSynaptic Transmission\r\nGABA\r\nHippocampus\r\nMemory\r\nStress\r\nSynaptic transmission\r\nn-3 PUFA","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pérez MÁ, Peñaloza-Sancho V, Ahumada J, Fuenzalida M, and Dagnino-Subiabre A (2018) n-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation restored impaired memory and GABAergic synaptic efficacy in the hippocampus of stressed rats..

Increasing evidence indicates that disturbances of fatty acids and phospholipid metabolism can play a part in a wide range of psychiatric, neurological, and developmental disorders in adults. Essential fatty acids, ω-3 and ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, play a central role in the normal development and functioning of the brain and central nervous system. The aim of this article is to discuss the overall insight into roles of essential fatty acids in the development of mental disorders (depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) and, in light of the fact that disturbances of fatty acid metabolism can play a part in the above-mentioned disorders, to investigate the current knowledge of lipid abnormalities in posttraumatic stress disorder. The information in this review was obtained after extensive MEDLINE searching of each topic area through relevant published studies from the past 20 years. References from the obtained studies were also used. This review summarizes the knowledge in terms of essential fatty acids intake and metabolism, as well as evidence pointing to potential mechanisms of essential fatty acids in normal brain functioning and development of neuropsychiatric disorders. The literature shows that ω-3 fatty acids provide numerous health benefits and that changes in their concentration in organisms are connected to a variety of psychiatric symptoms and disorders, including stress, anxiety, cognitive impairment, mood disorders, and schizophrenia. Further studies are necessary to confirm ω-3 fatty acids' supplementation as a potential rational treatment in psychiatric disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Perica MM ; Delas I ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0884533611411306 ","Keywords":"Brain/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nDietary Fats/*administration & dosage/metabolism\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Essential/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nLipid Metabolism\r\nMental Disorders/metabolism/*therapy\r\nStress, Psychological/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Perica MM, and Delas I (2011) Essential fatty acids and psychiatric disorders..

Although essential oils have been used, reputedly effectively, for centuries as a traditional medicine, there is very little verified science behind this use. The pharmacology of the essential oils and/or their single chemical constituents, therefore, remains largely undiscovered. However, accumulating evidence that inhaled or dermally applied essential oils enter the blood stream and, in relevant molecular, cellular or animal models, exert measurable psychological effects, indicates that the effects are primarily pharmacological.This review includes evidence from the limited number of clinical trials that have been published of 'psychoaromatherapy' in relation to psychiatric disorders, together with evidence from mechanistic, neuropharmacological studies of the effects of essential oils in relevant in vitro and in vivo models. It is concluded that aromatherapy provides a potentially effective treatment for a range of psychiatric disorders.

Among the FAs, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been widely recognized as a key molecule for neuronal function and cell signaling. Despite its relevance, the molecular pathways underlying the beneficial effects of DHA on the cells of the CNS are still unclear. Here, we summarize and discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of DHA in neural cells with a special focus on processes of survival, morphological development, and synaptic maturation. In addition, we examine the evidence supporting a potential therapeutic role of DHA against CNS tumor diseases and tumorigenesis. The current results suggest that DHA exerts its actions on neural cells mainly through the modulation of signaling cascades involving the activation of diverse types of receptors. In addition, we found evidence connecting brain DHA and ω-3 PUFA levels with CNS diseases, such as depression, autism spectrum disorders, obesity, and neurodegenerative diseases. In the context of cancer, the existing data have shown that DHA exerts positive actions as a coadjuvant in antitumoral therapy. Although many questions in the field remain only partially resolved, we hope that future research may soon define specific pathways and receptor systems involved in the beneficial effects of DHA in cells of the CNS, opening new avenues for innovative therapeutic strategies for CNS diseases.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Petermann AB ; Reyna-Jeldes M ; Ortega L ; Coddou C ; Yévenes GE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ijms23105390 ","Keywords":"Brain/metabolism\r\nCentral Nervous System/metabolism\r\n*Central Nervous System Diseases/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/metabolism/pharmacology\r\nFatty Acids/metabolism\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nCNS tumors\r\nDHA\r\nGPR40\r\ncell survival\r\ndocosahexaenoic acid\r\nneural morphology\r\nsynaptic function","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Petermann AB, Reyna-Jeldes M, Ortega L, Coddou C, and Yévenes GE (2022) Roles of the Unsaturated Fatty Acid Docosahexaenoic Acid in the Central Nervous System: Molecular and Cellular Insights..

This work aimed to verify the antihyperalgesic and antidepressive actions of (R)-(+)-limonene, α-phellandrene, and essential oil from S. terebinthifolius fruits in spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain in rats. METHODS: In the present work, essential oil from fruits of S. terebinthifolius, as well as the pure (R)-(+)-limonene and α-phellandrene compounds, were assayed for their effects on SNI-induced mechanical and cold hyperalgesia, and depressive-like behavior (immobility in forced swim test) in rats. The locomotor activity was evaluated in open-field test. RESULTS: Oral administration for up to 15 days of essential oil of S. terebinthifolius (100 mg/kg), (R)-(+)-limonene (10 mg/kg), α-phellandrene (10 mg/kg), and also subcutaneous 10 mg/kg dose of ketamine (positive control) significantly inhibited SNI-induced mechanical hyperalgesia and increased immobility in the forced swim test. On the 15th day of oral treatment, α-phellandrene, but neither the essential oil from S. terebinthifolius nor (R)-(+)-limonene, prevented the SNI-induced increase in sensitivity to a cold stimulus. The oral treatment with essential oil (100 mg/kg) or with compounds (10 mg/kg) did not interfere on locomotor activity. DISCUSSION: Together, the results of the present work show that essential oil of S. terebinthifolius and compounds present in this oil, including (R)-(+)-limonene and α-phellandrene, exhibit antihyperalgesic effects against mechanical hyperalgesia, and are antidepressive, while only α-phellandrene inhibited cold hyperalgesia in SNI rats.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Piccinelli AC ; Santos JA ; Konkiewitz EC ; Oesterreich SA ; Formagio AS ; Croda J ; Ziff EB ; Kassuya CA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1179/1476830514Y.0000000119 ","Keywords":"Anacardiaceae/*chemistry\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nCyclohexane Monoterpenes\r\nCyclohexenes/*pharmacology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFruit/chemistry\r\nHyperalgesia/drug therapy\r\nLimonene\r\nMale\r\nMonoterpenes/*pharmacology\r\nNeuralgia/*drug therapy\r\nOils, Volatile/*pharmacology\r\nPhysical Conditioning, Animal\r\nPlant Oils/pharmacology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nTerpenes/*pharmacology\r\nDepression\r\nLimonene\r\nNeuropathic pain\r\nPhellandrene\r\nRat\r\nSchinus terebinthifolius fruits","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Piccinelli AC, Santos JA, Konkiewitz EC, Oesterreich SA, Formagio AS, Croda J, Ziff EB, and Kassuya CA (2015) Antihyperalgesic and antidepressive actions of (R)-(+)-limonene, α-phellandrene, and essential oil from Schinus terebinthifolius fruits in a neuropathic pain model..

However, there is considerable room to improve the effectiveness of pharmacological antidepressant agents, as in only 50-60% of the depressed subjects with diabetes does pharmacotherapy lead to remission of depression. The aim of the present paper was to review whether polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of the omega-3 family could be used for the prevention and treatment of depression in Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: MEDLINE database and published reference lists were used to identify studies that examined the associations between omega-3 PUFA and depression. To examine potential side-effects, such as on glycaemic control, studies regarding the use of omega-3 supplements in Type 2 diabetes were also reviewed. RESULTS: Epidemiological and clinical studies suggest that a high intake of omega-3 PUFA protects against the development of depression. There is also some evidence that a low intake of omega-3 is associated with an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, but the results are less conclusive. Results from randomized controlled trials in non-diabetic subjects with major depression show that eicosapentaenoic acid is an effective adjunct treatment of depression in diabetes, while docosahexanoic acid is not. Moreover, consumption of omega-3 PUFA reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and may therefore indirectly decrease depression in Type 2 diabetes, via the reduction of cardiovascular complications. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with omega-3 PUFA, in particular eicosapentaenoic acid, may be a safe and helpful tool to reduce the incidence of depression and to treat depression in Type 2 diabetes. Further studies are now justified to test these hypotheses in patients with Type 2 diabetes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pouwer F ; Nijpels G ; Beekman AT ; Dekker JM ; van Dam RM ; Heine RJ ; Snoek FJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1464-5491.2005.01661.x ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDepressive Disorder/*prevention & control\r\nDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/diet therapy/*psychology\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pouwer F, Nijpels G, Beekman AT, Dekker JM, van Dam RM, Heine RJ, and Snoek FJ (2005) Fat food for a bad mood.

Fish oil (FO) supplementation during the prenatal and postnatal periods decreases depression-like and anxiety-like behaviors. The present study evaluated the effect of FO supplementation on Obx-induced depressive-like behavior and cognitive impairment. Female rats received supplementation with FO during habituation, mating, gestation, and lactation, and their pups were subjected to Obx in adulthood; after the recovery period, the adult offspring were subjected to behavioral tests, and the hippocampal levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), serotonin (5-HT) and the metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic (5-HIAA) were determined. Obx led to increased anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors, and impairment in the object location task. All behavioral changes were reversed by FO supplementation. Obx caused reductions in the levels of hippocampal BDNF and 5-HT, whereas FO supplementation restored these levels to normal values. In control rats, FO increased the hippocampal level of 5-HT and reduced that of 5-HIAA, indicating low 5-HT metabolism in this brain region. The present results indicate that FO supplementation during critical periods of brain development attenuated anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors and cognitive dysfunction induced by Obx. These results may be explained by increased levels of hippocampal BDNF and 5-HT, two major regulators of neuronal survival and long-term plasticity in this brain structure.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pudell C ; Vicente BA ; Delattre AM ; Carabelli B ; Mori MA ; Suchecki D ; Machado RB ; Zanata SM ; Visentainer JV ; de Oliveira Santos Junior O; Lima MM ; Ferraz AC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/ejn.12406 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnxiety Disorders/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nCentral Nervous System Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nCognition Disorders/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nFish Oils/*therapeutic use\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/growth & development/metabolism\r\nHydroxyindoleacetic Acid/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nNeuropsychological Tests\r\nOlfactory Bulb/physiology/surgery\r\nPregnancy\r\nPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effects\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nBDNF\r\ndepression\r\nmemory\r\nserotonin\r\nω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pudell C, Vicente BA, Delattre AM, Carabelli B, Mori MA, Suchecki D, Machado RB, Zanata SM, Visentainer JV, de Oliveira Santos Junior O, Lima MM, and Ferraz AC (2014) Fish oil improves anxiety-like, depressive-like and cognitive behaviors in olfactory bulbectomised rats..

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as a dietary constituent have been under the spotlight for decades. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids constitute key regulating factors of neurotransmission, neurogenesis, and neuroinflammation and are thereby fundamental for development, functioning, and aging of the CNS. Of note is the fact that these processes are altered in various psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, and Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN: Relevant literature was identified through a search of MEDLINE via PubMed using the following words, \"n-3 PUFAs,\" \"EPA,\" and \"DHA\" in combination with \"stress,\" \"cognition,\" \"ADHD,\" \"anxiety,\" \"depression,\" \"bipolar disorder,\" \"schizophrenia,\" and \"Alzheimer.\" The principal focus was on the role of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids throughout the lifespan and their implication for psychopathologies. Recommendations for future investigation on the potential clinical value of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids were examined. RESULTS: The inconsistent and inconclusive results from randomized clinical trials limits the usage of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in clinical practice. However, a body of literature demonstrates an inverse correlation between omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels and quality of life/ psychiatric diseases. Specifically, older healthy adults showing low habitual intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids benefit most from consuming them, showing improved age-related cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: Although further studies are required, there is an exciting and growing body of research suggesting that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may have a potential clinical value in the prevention and treatment of psychopathologies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pusceddu MM ; Kelly P ; Stanton C ; Cryan JF ; Dinan TG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/ijnp/pyw078 ","Keywords":"Age Factors\r\nAging/*psychology\r\nAnimals\r\nBrain/*drug effects/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nCognition/drug effects\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage\r\n*Feeding Behavior\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/metabolism/physiopathology/*prevention & control/psychology\r\n*Mental Health\r\nProtective Factors\r\nRisk Factors\r\nAlzheimer’s disease\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ndepression\r\nomega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs)\r\nschizophrenia","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pusceddu MM, Kelly P, Stanton C, Cryan JF, and Dinan TG (2016) N-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids through the Lifespan: Implication for Psychopathology..

Behavioral (sucrose intake, immobility time of forced swimming test) and biochemical parameters [serotonin (5-HT) in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, gastric mucosa cholecystokinin (CCK) and serum gastrin (GAS) levels] were simultaneously examined in the CUMS rats. 20 mg/kg HMM alone, but not OGR, significantly increased sucrose intake and reduced immobility time in the CUMS rats. Moreover, 20 mg/kg HMM and 14 mg/kg OGR in combination exhibited significant synergistic effects on sucrose intake increase and immobility time reduction in the CUMS rats. HMM elevated 5-HT levels in various brain regions, and OGR reduced gastric mucosa CCK and serum GAS levels in the CUMS rats. These results suggested that the synergistic antidepressant-like effects of compatibility of HMM with OGR might be mediated simultaneously by regulation of the serotonergic and gastroenteric system functions. These findings also provided a pharmacological basis for the clinical application of this drug pair of magnolia bark and ginger rhizome in traditional Chinese medicine.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Qiang LQ ; Wang CP ; Wang FM ; Pan Y ; Yi LT ; Zhang X ; Kong LD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s12272-009-1914-6 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBiphenyl Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nBrain/drug effects\r\nCholecystokinin/analysis\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nGastric Mucosa/chemistry/drug effects\r\nGastrins/blood\r\n*Ginger\r\nLignans/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nOils, Volatile/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSerotonin/analysis\r\nSwimming","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Qiang LQ, Wang CP, Wang FM, Pan Y, Yi LT, Zhang X, and Kong LD (2009) Combined administration of the mixture of honokiol and magnolol and ginger oil evokes antidepressant-like synergism in rats..

Approximately 30%-40% of patients with major depression have only a partial response to available pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been used either alone or in combination with conventional therapies in patients with mood disorders. This review of the literature examines evidence-based data on the use of CAM in mood disorders. A search of the PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, and Quertile databases using keywords was conducted, and relevant articles published in the English language in the peer-reviewed journals over the past two decades were retrieved. Evidence-based data suggest that light therapy, St John's wort, Rhodiola rosea, omega-3 fatty acids, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness therapies, exercise, sleep deprivation, and S-adenosylmethionine are effective in the treatment of mood disorders. Clinical trials of vitamin B complex, vitamin D, and methylfolate found that, while these were useful in physical illness, results were equivocal in patients with mood disorders. Studies support the adjunctive role of omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid in unipolar and bipolar depression, although manic symptoms are not affected and higher doses are required in patients with resistant bipolar depression and rapid cycling. Omega-3 fatty acids are useful in pregnant women with major depression, and have no adverse effects on the fetus. Choline, inositol, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, and N-acetylcysteine are effective adjuncts in bipolar patients. Dehydroepiandrosterone is effective both in bipolar depression and depression in the setting of comorbid physical disease, although doses should be titrated to avoid adverse effects. Ayurvedic and homeopathic therapies have the potential to improve symptoms of depression, although larger controlled trials are needed. Mind-body-spirit and integrative medicine approaches can be used effectively in mild to moderate depression and in treatment-resistant depression. Currently, although CAM therapies are not the primary treatment of mood disorders, level 1 evidence could emerge in the future showing that such treatments are effective.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Qureshi NA ; Al-Bedah AM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2147/NDT.S43419 ","Keywords":"Ayurveda\r\ncomplementary and alternative medicine\r\nhomeopathy\r\nintegrative medicine\r\nmood disorders","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Qureshi NA, and Al-Bedah AM (2013) Mood disorders and complementary and alternative medicine: a literature review..

The present study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of omega-3 and vitamin D co-supplementation on psychological distresses in women of reproductive age with pre-diabetes and hypovitaminosis D. METHODS: The present factorial clinical trial was conducted on 168 women of reproductive age with pre-diabetes and hypovitaminosis D. These participants were selected by stratified random sampling and were assigned to four groups for 8 weeks: group 1 (placebo group), group 2 (omega-3 group), group 3 (vitamin D group), and group 4 (co-supplement group). The medication and placebo doses being two 1000-mg tablets each day for omega-3 and 50,000-IU pearls every 2 weeks for vitamin D. Fasting blood glucose and vitamin D were measured at the beginning of the study. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were completed by the participants at the start and end of the intervention. RESULTS: A significant difference was observed in terms of reduction in anxiety and improvement in sleep quality in the co-supplementation compared to the other three groups (p < .05). There was also a significant difference between the group receiving both supplements and the group receiving only placebos in terms of reduction in depression and stress (p < .05). CONCLUSION: Vitamin D and omega-3 co-supplementation improved depression, anxiety, and sleep quality in women of reproductive age with pre-diabetes and hypovitaminosis D. Therefore, these two supplements can be recommended for improving the mental health of this group of women. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials Code: IRCT20100130003226N17.

The purpose of this review was to critically evaluate the evidence base for nutritional supplements in the treatment of bipolar depression (BD). A literature search for all randomized, controlled clinical trials using nutritional supplements in the treatment of BD was conducted via PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE computerized database. The studies were organized into essential nutrients/minerals, nonessential nutrients, and combinations of nutritional products. Among essential nutrients/minerals, omega-3-fatty acids (O3FAs) have the strongest evidence of efficacy for bipolar depression, although some studies failed to find positive effects from O3FAs. Weak evidence supports efficacy of vitamin C whereas no data support the usefulness of folic acid and choline. Among nonessential nutrients, cytidine is the least supported treatment. Studies of N-acetylcysteine have not resolved its efficacy in treating acute depressive episodes relative to placebo. However, one study demonstrates its potential to improve depressive symptoms over time and the other, though nonsignificant, suggests it has a prophylactic effect. Studies of inositol have been mostly negative, except for 1 study. Those that were negative were underpowered but demonstrated numerically positive effects for inositol. There is no evidence that citicholine is efficacious for uncomplicated BD depression, though it may have value for comorbid substance abuse among BD patients. Finally, combination O3FA-cytidine lacks evidence of efficacy. The findings of this review do not support the routine use of nutritional supplements in the treatment or prophylaxis of BD depression. Studies with more rigorous designs are required before definitive conclusions can be made. Despite the inadequacy of the existing data, clinicians should remain open to the value of nutritional supplements: after all, lithium is a mineral too.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rakofsky JJ ; Dunlop BW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/da.22220 ","Keywords":"Antimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*therapy\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nclinical trials\r\ndepression\r\npharmacotherapy\r\ntreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rakofsky JJ, and Dunlop BW (2014) Review of nutritional supplements for the treatment of bipolar depression..

The role of nutrition as a cost-effective approach in the prevention and management of these conditions has received recent attention, particularly nutrients such as iron, zinc, and n-3 (omega-3) fatty acids, which play a role in brain structure and function. The objective of this article was to review current evidence on the relation between n-3 fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and maternal and child mental health disorders. Human studies published in English were identified from Medline databases (1966 to June 2008) by using key search terms and review articles. A summary of the role of DHA in the human brain is followed by a review of human studies, both observational and intervention trials, that examine the relation between n-3 fatty acids such as DHA and depression and child mental health disorders. Observational studies support a direct association between poor n-3 fatty acid status and increased risk of maternal depression and childhood behavioral disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, evidence from intervention trials is weak. Most of the studies reviewed had small sample sizes and were conducted in clinically diagnosed samples, with no placebo-controlled groups. Little is known about the benefits of DHA in the prevention of maternal depression and ADHD. Large, well-designed, community-based prevention trials are needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ramakrishnan U ; Imhoff-Kunsch B ; DiGirolamo AM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3945/ajcn.2008.26692F ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAnimals\r\nAttention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*metabolism\r\nChild\r\nDepression/*metabolism\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/administration & dosage/*metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\n*Mothers","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ramakrishnan U, Imhoff-Kunsch B, and DiGirolamo AM (2009) Role of docosahexaenoic acid in maternal and child mental health..

Intake of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially the n-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid, which are found predominantly in cold water fish, has been associated with a range of mental health outcomes and may improve MMH. The demands for these fatty acids are increased during pregnancy and lactation, and may influence MMH as they are integral parts of cell membranes especially in the brain and play a role in physiological processes such as membrane fluidity and neurotransmitter function. Observational studies and intervention trials that have examined the role of fatty acids and MMH disorders especially post-partum depression (PPD) were identified using Pubmed and have been reviewed. Only three well-designed large prospective studies were identified; these studies examined the relationship between dietary intakes of n-3 fatty acids and fish during pregnancy, and found limited evidence of an association with PPD. Several intervention trials (n=8) have been done but generally suffer from small sample size and vary in terms of the study subject characteristics and timing, duration and dosage of the intervention. The results are mixed, but one recently completed large trial found no evidence of benefit among women who received DHA during pregnancy. Few studies have been conducted in developing countries, and gaps remain on the influence of other nutrient deficiencies, genetic polymorphisms that influence n-3 fatty acid synthesis and total fatty acid intake.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ramakrishnan U ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1740-8709.2011.00312.x ","Keywords":"Brain/metabolism\r\nDepression, Postpartum/epidemiology/psychology\r\nDeveloping Countries\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/*metabolism\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/*metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfant\r\nLactation\r\nMale\r\n*Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nMaternal Welfare/*psychology\r\n*Mental Health\r\nPregnancy\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ramakrishnan U (2011) Fatty acid status and maternal mental health..

Results are presented in terms of standardized treatment effect size (ES) for change in HAM-D-17 from baseline to treatment week 8. Although overall treatment group differences were negligible (ES=-0.13 to +0.04), subjects with any 'high' inflammation improved more on EPA than placebo (ES=-0.39) or DHA (ES=-0.60) and less on DHA than placebo (ES=+0.21); furthermore, EPA-placebo separation increased with increasing numbers of markers of high inflammation. Subjects randomized to EPA with 'high' IL-1ra or hs-CRP or low adiponectin ('high' inflammation) had medium ES decreases in HAM-D-17 scores vs subjects 'low' on these biomarkers. Subjects with 'high' hs-CRP, IL-6 or leptin were less placebo-responsive than subjects with low levels of these biomarkers (medium to large ES differences). Employing multiple markers of inflammation facilitated identification of a more homogeneous cohort of subjects with MDD responding to EPA vs placebo in our cohort.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on depressive symptoms was evaluated in HIV-positive individuals. METHOD: A total of 100 HIV-positive patients with Beck Depression Score ≥16, were assigned to receive either omega-3 fatty acids or placebo twice daily for 8 weeks. Depressive symptoms of each participant were evaluated at baseline (month 0) and at the end of months 1 and 2 of the study. Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition, depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire were used for assessment of depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Reduction in mean ± SD of all depression scores during the study period was statistically significant within the omega-3 group and when compared with the placebo group (for both comparisons, P < 0.001). Also, the mean differences of all depression scores were decreased significantly during the intervals: months 0, 1, and 2 (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Among the participants, 7 (7%) and 4 (4%) patients in the omega-3 and the placebo group, respectively, experienced mild gastrointestinal problems, but the incidence of adverse drug reactions related to the interventions was not statistically different between the groups (P = 0.09).

A revision of these guidelines was undertaken by CANMAT in 2008-2009 to reflect advances in the field. There is widespread interest in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: The CANMAT guidelines are based on a question-answer format to enhance accessibility to clinicians. An evidence-based format was used with updated systematic reviews of the literature and recommendations were graded according to Level of Evidence using pre-defined criteria. Lines of Treatment were identified based on criteria that included evidence and expert clinical support. This section on \"Complementary and Alternative Medicine Treatments\" is one of 5 guideline articles. RESULTS: There is Level 1 evidence to support light therapy in seasonal MDD and St. John's wort in mild to moderate MDD. There is also some evidence for the use of exercise, yoga and sleep deprivation, as well as for omega-3 fatty acids and SAM-e . Support for other natural health products and therapies is still limited. LIMITATIONS: The evidence base remains limited and studies often have methodological problems, including small samples, variability in dose, short duration of treatment, unknown quality of the agent and limited long-term data. Safety data are also sparse with little information about drug interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Some CAM treatments have evidence of benefit in MDD.

The benefits and risks of such combination strategies have not been fully evaluated. This paper evaluates the risk-benefit profile of CAM augmentation to antidepressants in affective conditions. METHODS: PubMed was searched for all available clinical reports published in English up to December 2012. Data were evaluated based on graded levels of evidence for efficacy and safety. RESULTS: Generally, the evidence base is significantly larger for depression than for anxiety disorder. In unipolar depression, there is Level 2 evidence for adjunctive sleep deprivation (SD) and Free and Easy Wanderer Plus (FEWP), and Level 3 for exercise, yoga, light therapy (LT), omega-3 fatty acids, S-adenosylmethionine and tryptophan. In bipolar depression, there is Level 1 evidence for adjunctive omega-3s, Level 2 for SD, and Level 3 for LT and FEWP. In anxiety conditions, exercise augmentation has Level 3 support in generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Though mostly well-tolerated, these therapies can only be recommended as third-line interventions due to the quality of available evidence. LIMITATIONS: Overall, the literature is limited. Studies often had methodological weaknesses, with little information on long-term use and on potential drug-CAM interactions. Many CAM studies were not published in English. CONCLUSIONS: While several CAM therapies show some evidence of benefit as augmentation in depressive disorders, such evidence is largely lacking in anxiety disorders. The general dearth of adequate safety and tolerability data encourages caution in clinical use.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ravindran AV ; da Silva TL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2013.05.042 ","Keywords":"Anxiety Disorders/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nComplementary Therapies/adverse effects/*methods\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMeditation\r\nMood Disorders/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nPhototherapy\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/therapeutic use\r\nTryptophan/therapeutic use\r\nYoga\r\nAnxiety disorders\r\nAugmentation\r\nCombination\r\nComplementary and alternative medicine\r\nDepressive disorders\r\nSystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ravindran AV, and da Silva TL (2013) Complementary and alternative therapies as add-on to pharmacotherapy for mood and anxiety disorders: a systematic review..

The scope of the 2016 guidelines remains the management of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults, with a target audience of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals. METHODS: Using the question-answer format, we conducted a systematic literature search focusing on systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Evidence was graded using CANMAT-defined criteria for level of evidence. Recommendations for lines of treatment were based on the quality of evidence and clinical expert consensus. \"Complementary and Alternative Medicine Treatments\" is the fifth of six sections of the 2016 guidelines. RESULTS: Evidence-informed responses were developed for 12 questions for 2 broad categories of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions: 1) physical and meditative treatments (light therapy, sleep deprivation, exercise, yoga, and acupuncture) and 2) natural health products (St. John's wort, omega-3 fatty acids; S-adenosyl-L-methionine [SAM-e], dehydroepiandrosterone, folate, Crocus sativus, and others). Recommendations were based on available data on efficacy, tolerability, and safety. CONCLUSIONS: For MDD of mild to moderate severity, exercise, light therapy, St. John's wort, omega-3 fatty acids, SAM-e, and yoga are recommended as first- or second-line treatments. Adjunctive exercise and adjunctive St. John's wort are second-line recommendations for moderate to severe MDD. Other physical treatments and natural health products have less evidence but may be considered as third-line treatments. CAM treatments are generally well tolerated. Caveats include methodological limitations of studies and paucity of data on long-term outcomes and drug interactions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ravindran AV ; Balneaves LG ; Faulkner G ; Ortiz A ; McIntosh D ; Morehouse RL ; Ravindran L ; Yatham LN ; Kennedy SH ; Lam RW ; MacQueen GM ; Milev RV ; Parikh SV ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0706743716660290 ","Keywords":"Acupuncture Therapy/methods/*standards\r\nBiological Products/*therapeutic use\r\nCanada\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*therapy\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine/*standards\r\nExercise Therapy/methods/*standards\r\nHumans\r\nPhototherapy/methods/*standards\r\nPractice Guidelines as Topic/*standards\r\n*Sleep Deprivation\r\nclinical practice guidelines\r\ncomplementary and alternative medicine\r\nevidence-based medicine\r\nexercise\r\nlight therapy\r\nmajor depressive disorder\r\nmeta-analysis\r\nnatural health products\r\nsleep deprivation\r\nsystematic reviews","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ravindran AV, Balneaves LG, Faulkner G, Ortiz A, McIntosh D, Morehouse RL, Ravindran L, Yatham LN, Kennedy SH, Lam RW, MacQueen GM, Milev RV, and Parikh SV (2016) Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) 2016 Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Adults with Major Depressive Disorder: Section 5.

Women who are depressed during pregnancy are at a higher risk for preterm delivery, preeclampsia, birth difficulties, and postpartum depression. The treatment of depression in conventional medicine has focused on physiological factors that lead to impaired neurotransmitter function and treatments to improve neurotransmitter function. Pharmaceutical substances pose risks for pregnant and lactating women, and lower risk options are preferred. Micronutrients, including certain B vitamins, folate, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), play a role in the synthesis and absorption of neurotransmitters. Experimental studies suggest that supplementation with specific micronutrients may alleviate depressive symptoms and improve birth outcomes in patients with perinatal depression. Alternative treatments for depression, including nutritional supplements, are an important treatment option for depressive symptoms while limiting potential side effects and treatment costs. This article explores the biological basis of perinatal depression and reviews the potential benefits of non-pharmacological interventions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rechenberg K ; Humphries D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Brain/physiopathology\r\nDepression/*diet therapy/drug therapy\r\nDepression, Postpartum/*diet therapy/drug therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHomocysteine/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\n*Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nPregnancy\r\ndepression\r\nnutrition\r\nperinatal depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rechenberg K, and Humphries D (2013) Nutritional interventions in depression and perinatal depression..

As the pathophysiological mechanisms are very complex and multifactorial, current treatments are only symptomatic and often worsen the glucose control. Thus, the search for more effective treatments are extremely urgent. In this way, we aimed to investigate the effect of chronic treatment with fish oil (FO), a source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, over the mechanical allodynia and in depressive-like behaviors in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. It was observed that the diabetic (DBT) animals, when compared to normoglycemic (NGL) animals, developed a significant mechanical allodynia since the second week after diabetes induction, peaking at fourth week which is completely prevented by FO treatment (0.5, 1 or 3g/kg). Moreover, DBT animals showed an increase of immobility frequency and a decrease of swimming and climbing frequencies in modified forced swimming test (MFST) since the second week after diabetes injection, lasting up at the 4th week. FO treatment (only at a dose of 3g/kg) significantly decreased the immobility frequency and increased the swimming frequency, but did not induce significant changes in the climbing frequency in DBT rats. Moreover, it was observed that DBT animals had significantly lower levels of BDNF in both hippocampus and pre frontal cortex when compared to NGL rats, which is completely prevented by FO treatment. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that FO treatment was able to prevent the mechanical allodynia and the depressive-like behaviors in DBT rats, which seems to be related to its capacity of BDNF level restoration.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Redivo DD ; Schreiber AK ; Adami ER ; Ribeiro DE ; Joca SR ; Zanoveli JM ; Cunha JM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2015.10.058 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nCerebral Cortex/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/*diet therapy/physiopathology\r\nDiabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*diet therapy/physiopathology\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage\r\nFish Oils/*administration & dosage\r\nHippocampus/metabolism\r\nHyperalgesia/*diet therapy/physiopathology\r\nMale\r\nMotor Activity\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nTouch\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nBDNF\r\nDepression\r\nFish oil\r\nPain\r\nStreptozotocin","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Redivo DD, Schreiber AK, Adami ER, Ribeiro DE, Joca SR, Zanoveli JM, and Cunha JM (2016) Effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid treatment over mechanical allodynia and depressive-like behavior associated with experimental diabetes..

Hence the aim of the present study was to assess whether omega-3 fatty acid treatment is superior to placebo in the treatment of PND. METHOD: A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial was undertaken. Women with major depression during the perinatal period received either fish oil or placebo for six weeks. Changes in depression scores were recorded weekly. RESULTS: A total of 26 subjects were recruited and there was no significant difference in depression scores between those receiving fish oil and those receiving the placebo. CONCLUSIONS: This is formally a negative study, suggesting that there is no benefit for omega-3 fatty acids over placebo in treating PND. The reason could be that the study was underpowered due to recruitment difficulties and therefore we suggest that it may be unwise to interpret this result as conclusive.

METHODS: Early stress was induced through maternal deprivation (MD), while late life stress was induced using the chronic mild stress (CMS) protocol. Young rats which were subjected to MD and the adult rats which were subjected to CMS were treated with omega-3 fatty acids (0.72 g/kg), NAC (20 mg/kg) or folic acid (50 mg/kg) once/day, for a period of 20 days. Then, the animals' immobility times were evaluated using the forced swimming test. Oxidative stress parameters were evaluated in the brain. RESULTS: Depressive-like behavior induced by CMS was prevented by NAC and folic acid, and depressive-like behavior induced by MD was prevented by NAC, folic acid and omega-3. NAC, folic acid and omega-3 were able to exert antioxidant effects in the brain of rats subjected to CMS or MD. These preventive treatments decreased the levels of protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation, and also decreased the concentrations of nitrite/nitrate and reduced the activity of myeloperoxidase activity in the rat brain which was induced by CMS or MD. NAC, folic acid and omega-3 increased superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in the rat brain subjected to early or late life stress. CONCLUSIONS: NAC, omega-3 and folic acid may present interesting lines of treatment based on their antioxidant properties, which cause an inhibition of behavioral and brain changes that occur from stressful life events.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Réus GZ ; Maciel AL ; Abelaira HM ; de Moura AB ; de Souza TG ; Dos Santos TR; Darabas AC ; Parzianello M ; Matos D ; Abatti M ; Vieira AC ; Fucillini V ; Michels M ; Dal-Pizzol F ; Quevedo J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.nut.2018.03.006 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology\r\nAntioxidants/pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nBrain/*drug effects\r\nDepressive Disorder/*prevention & control\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*pharmacology\r\nFolic Acid/*pharmacology\r\nLipid Peroxidation/drug effects\r\nMaternal Deprivation\r\nOxidative Stress/*drug effects\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nStress, Psychological/complications\r\nAnimal model of depression\r\nAntidepressant\r\nFolic acid\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nOxidative stress\r\nω-3","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Réus GZ, Maciel AL, Abelaira HM, de Moura AB, de Souza TG, Dos Santos TR, Darabas AC, Parzianello M, Matos D, Abatti M, Vieira AC, Fucillini V, Michels M, Dal-Pizzol F, and Quevedo J (2018) ω-3 and folic acid act against depressive-like behavior and oxidative damage in the brain of rats subjected to early- or late-life stress..

There is thus a clinical and ethical imperative to provide effective treatment for youth depression with an acceptable risk-benefit balance. Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play an important role in a range of physiological processes in living organisms. Supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs has been shown to have a range of beneficial effects on both physical and mental health, and results of previous trials suggest that omega-3 PUFAs may be a safe and effective treatment for depression. However, conclusions from these trials have been limited by their relatively small sample sizes. METHODS: This trial will test the effectiveness of a 12-week parallel group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 1.4 g day(-1) omega-3 PUFAs in help seeking 15- to 25-year-olds (N = 400) presenting with major depressive disorder. The primary hypothesis is that young people will show greater improvement of depressive symptoms after 12 weeks of treatment with omega-3 PUFAs plus cognitive behavioural case management compared with treatment with placebo plus cognitive behavioural case management. CONCLUSION: Because of using a large sample, results from this study will provide the strongest evidence to date to inform the use of omega-3 PUFAs as first-line therapy in young people presenting with major depressive disorder. The study also heralds an important step towards indicated prevention of persistent depression, which may reduce the burden, stigmatization, disability and economic consequences of this disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rice SM ; Hickie IB ; Yung AR ; Mackinnon A ; Berk M ; Davey C ; Hermens DF ; Hetrick SE ; Parker AG ; Schäfer MR ; McGorry PD ; Amminger GP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/eip.12166 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*diet therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nYoung Adult\r\nadolescent\r\nmajor depressive disorder\r\nomega-3 fatty acid\r\nrandomized control trial\r\nyoung adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rice SM, Hickie IB, Yung AR, Mackinnon A, Berk M, Davey C, Hermens DF, Hetrick SE, Parker AG, Schäfer MR, McGorry PD, and Amminger GP (2016) Youth depression alleviation: the Fish Oil Youth Depression Study (YoDA-F): A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trial..

Increasing evidence, reviewed here, indicates that LC-PUFA deficiencies or imbalances are associated with childhood developmental and psychiatric disorders including ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, and autistic spectrum disorders. These conditions show a high clinical overlap and run in the same families, as well as showing associations with various adult psychiatric disorders in which FA abnormalities are already implicated, such as depression, other mood disorders, and schizophrenia. Preliminary evidence from controlled trials also suggests that dietary supplementation with LC-PUFA might help in the management of these kinds of childhood behavioral and learning difficulties. Treatment with omega-3 FA appears most promising, but the few small studies published to date have involved different populations, study designs, treatments, and outcome measures. Large-scale studies are now needed to confirm the benefits reported. Further research is also required to assess the durability of such treatment effects, to determine optimal treatment compositions and dosages, and to develop reliable ways of identifying those individuals most likely to benefit from this kind of treatment. Childhood developmental and psychiatric disorders clearly reflect multifactorial influences, but the study of LC-PUFA and their metabolism could offer important new approaches to their early identification and management. Heterogeneity and comorbidity are such, however, that a focus on specific traits or symptoms may prove more fruitful than an exclusive reliance on current diagnostic categories.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Richardson AJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11745-004-1350-z ","Keywords":"Brain/cytology/physiology\r\nChild\r\nDevelopmental Disabilities/*etiology\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/pharmacology/*physiology\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/drug therapy/*etiology\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Richardson AJ (2004) Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in childhood developmental and psychiatric disorders..

Many clinical and epidemiologic studies have shown positive roles for n-3 fatty acids in infant development; cancer; cardiovascular diseases; and more recently, in various mental illnesses, including depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. These fatty acids are known to have pleiotropic effects, including effects against inflammation, platelet aggregation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. These beneficial effects may be mediated through several distinct mechanisms, including alterations in cell membrane composition and function, gene expression, or eicosanoid production. A number of authorities have recently recommended increases in intakes of n-3 fatty acids by the general population. To comply with this recommendation a variety of food products, most notably eggs, yogurt, milk, and spreads have been enriched with these fatty acids. Ongoing research will further determine the tissue distribution, biological effects, cost-effectiveness, and consumer acceptability of such enriched products. Furthermore, additional controlled clinical trials are needed to document whether long-term consumption or supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid/docosahexaenoic acid or the plant-derived counterpart (alpha-linolenic acid) results in better quality of life.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Riediger ND ; Othman RA ; Suh M ; Moghadasian MH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jada.2008.12.022 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAttention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/epidemiology/prevention & control\r\nCardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/*prevention & control\r\nChild\r\nChild Development/*physiology\r\nChild, Preschool\r\nDementia/epidemiology/prevention & control\r\nDepression/epidemiology/prevention & control\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*physiology\r\nFemale\r\nFood, Fortified\r\nHumans\r\nInfant\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nMale\r\nMental Disorders/epidemiology/*prevention & control\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNeoplasms/epidemiology/*prevention & control\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Riediger ND, Othman RA, Suh M, and Moghadasian MH (2009) A systemic review of the roles of n-3 fatty acids in health and disease..

Currently, patients receive pharmacological treatment with mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and antidepressants. Unfortunately, not all patients respond well to this type of treatment. Bipolar patients are also more prone to heart and metabolic diseases as well as a higher risk of suicide compared to the healthy population. For a correct brain function is indispensable a right protein and lipids (e.g., fatty acids) balance. In particular, the amount of fatty acids in the brain corresponds to a 50-70% of the dry weight. It has been reported that in specific brain regions of BD patients there is a reduction in the content of unsaturated n-3 fatty acids. Accordingly, a diet rich in n-3 fatty acids has beneficial effects in BD patients, while their absence or high levels of saturated fatty acids in the diet are correlated to the risk of developing the disease. On the other hand, the histamine system is likely to be involved in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric diseases such as BD. Histamine is a neuromodulator involved in arousal, motivation, and energy balance; drugs acting on the histamine receptor H3 have shown potential as antidepressants and antipsychotics.

Various studies have shown that long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) may be useful in its management. Our objective was to evaluate whether a supplement containing n-3 PUFA improves depressive symptoms in depressed elderly patients, and whether the blood fatty acid pattern is correlated with these changes. METHODS: The severity of depressive symptoms according to the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), blood fatty acid composition and erythrocyte phospholipids were analyzed in 46 depressed females aged 66-95y, diagnosed with depression according to DSMIV, within the context of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 22 depressed females were included in the intervention group (2.5 g/day of n-3 PUFA for 8 weeks), and 24 in the placebo group. We also measured immunological parameters (CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16, CD19 and cytokines (IL-5, IL-15). RESULTS: The mean GDS score and AA/EPA ratio, in whole blood and RBC membrane phospholipids, were significantly lower after 2 months supplementation with n-3 PUFA. A significant correlation between the amelioration of GDS and the AA/EPA ratio with some immunological parameters, such as CD2, CD19, CD4, CD16 and the ratio CD4/CD8, was also found. Nevertheless, omega-3 supplementation did not significantly improve the studied immunological functions. CONCLUSIONS: n-3 PUFA supplementation ameliorates symptoms in elderly depression. The n-3 PUFA status may be monitored by means of the determination of whole blood AA/EPA ratio.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rizzo AM ; Corsetto PA ; Montorfano G ; Opizzi A ; Faliva M ; Giacosa A ; Ricevuti G ; Pelucchi C ; Berra B ; Rondanelli M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1475-2891-11-82 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\n*Aging\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntigens, CD/blood\r\nArachidonic Acid/*blood\r\nCytokines/blood\r\nDepression/*blood/*diet therapy/immunology/physiopathology\r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/*blood\r\nErythrocyte Membrane/metabolism\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nGeriatric Assessment\r\nHumans\r\nLymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism\r\nPhospholipids/blood/chemistry\r\nSeverity of Illness Index","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rizzo AM, Corsetto PA, Montorfano G, Opizzi A, Faliva M, Giacosa A, Ricevuti G, Pelucchi C, Berra B, and Rondanelli M (2012) Comparison between the AA/EPA ratio in depressed and non depressed elderly females: omega-3 fatty acid supplementation correlates with improved symptoms but does not change immunological parameters..

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) are vital structural and functional components of the developing brain. The gut microbiota is also influenced by n-3 PUFA status, however, little is known about the role of maternal and early-life n-3 PUFA intake on offspring gut microbiota development and subsequent interactions with central nervous system functioning and behavioural outcomes. METHODS: Pregnant female C57BL/6 mice and their male offspring were fed a control (CON), omega-3 deficient (O3-) or omega-3 supplemented (O3+) diet. Cognitive, depressive and social behaviours were assessed through a battery of behaviour tests in the male offspring at both adolescence (week 4-5) and adulthood (week 11-13). Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) activation was assessed by analysis of stress-induced corticosterone production. Fecal microbiota composition was analysed by 16S sequencing at both adolescent and adulthood. In addition, stimulated spleen cytokine levels were assessed. RESULTS: n-3 PUFA interventions induced subtle changes in offspring early-life and adolescent behaviours, which were further evident in adulthood, such that O3- animals displayed impaired communication, social and depression-related behaviours and O3+ animals displayed enhanced cognition. O3- mice displayed an elevated Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio and blunted systemic LPS responsiveness. Contrastingly, O3+ mice displayed greater fecal Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus abundance and dampened HPA-axis activity. CONCLUSIONS: Neurobehavioural development related to cognitive, anxiety and social behaviours, is highly dependent upon in utero and lifelong n-3 PUFA availability. In addition, neurobehavioural changes induced by altering n-3 PUFA status are closely associated with comprehensive alterations in gut microbiota composition, HPA-axis activity and inflammation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Robertson RC ; Seira Oriach C; Murphy K ; Moloney GM ; Cryan JF ; Dinan TG ; Paul Ross R; Stanton C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbi.2016.07.145 ","Keywords":"Aging/psychology\r\nAnimals\r\nBehavior, Animal/*physiology\r\nCognition\r\nCorticosterone/blood\r\nCytokines/metabolism\r\nDepression/psychology\r\nFatty Acids/metabolism\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*physiology\r\nFear\r\nFemale\r\nGastrointestinal Microbiome/*physiology\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/physiology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System/physiology\r\nPregnancy\r\nRecognition, Psychology\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nStress, Psychological/metabolism/psychology\r\nSwimming/psychology\r\nVocalization, Animal\r\nAdolescence\r\nBehaviour\r\nCognition\r\nCorticosterone\r\nDepression\r\nDiet\r\nGut-brain axis\r\nInflammation\r\nMicrobiota\r\nNeurodevelopment\r\nOmega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nPsychiatric illnesses\r\nSocial behaviour","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Robertson RC, Seira Oriach C, Murphy K, Moloney GM, Cryan JF, Dinan TG, Paul Ross R, and Stanton C (2017) Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids critically regulate behaviour and gut microbiota development in adolescence and adulthood..

To examine adjunctive omega-3 treatment for recent onset psychosis, participants aged 15-40 years with recent onset schizophrenia-spectrum (n = 46) or bipolar (n = 4) disorders and current psychotic symptoms were treated for 16 weeks with risperidone and randomly-assigned omega-3 (EPA 740 mg and DHA 400 mg daily) or matching placebo. The primary outcome measure was the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total score. Mean lifetime antipsychotic exposure was 18.1 days. Length of time in treatment, risperidone dose and number of omega-3/placebo capsules taken did not differ between conditions. Longitudinal analysis of the total BPRS score revealed a trend level (p = 0.0826) treatment effect favoring omega-3 treatment. Lorazepam was an allowed concomitant medication. Among the subgroup (N = 23) who did not receive lorazepam, the treatment effect on BPRS total scores favoring omega-3 was significant (p = 0.0406) and factor scores analyses revealed a substantial decrease in depression-anxiety with omega-3 but no change with placebo (treatment-by-time interaction, p = 0.0184). Motor side effects did not differ between conditions. Analysis of Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events assessments revealed fewer adverse events overall with omega-3 compared with placebo with the largest differences between conditions (all favoring omega-3) on confusion, anxiety, depression, irritability, and tiredness/fatigue. These results suggest that omega-3 adjuvant treatment is a potential option for depression and anxiety symptoms of people with recent onset psychosis. Further research is needed to confirm this potential.

The authors investigated whether a supplement containing long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) improves depressive symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in depressed elderly patients. DESIGN: Eight-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Nursing home in Pavia, Italy. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-six depressed women, aged 66-95 years. INTERVENTION: Twenty-two depressed women were included in the intervention group (n-3 group, which received 2.5 g/d of n-3 LCPUFA, with 1.67 g of eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and 0.83 g of docosahesaenoic acid [DHA]), and 24 patients were included in the placebo group. The primary endpoint was the improvement of depressive symptoms, as evaluated by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Secondary endpoints were the evaluation of HRQoL, by using the Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36), and modifications of erythrocyte membrane phospholipids fatty acid profile. All variables were assessed before and after the treatment period of 8 weeks. RESULTS: The mean GDS at 8 weeks was significantly lower compared with the n-3 group. The SF-36 physical and mental components were significantly increased in the intervention group. Compliance was good, as confirmed by erythrocyte membrane phospholipid FA concentrations, with a significant increase of EPA and DHA in the intervention group. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with n-3 LCPUFA is efficacious in the amelioration of depressive symptoms and quality of life in the treatment of depressed elderly female patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rondanelli M ; Giacosa A ; Opizzi A ; Pelucchi C ; La Vecchia C ; Montorfano G ; Negroni M ; Berra B ; Politi P ; Rizzo AM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/07315724.2010.10719817 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nCell Membrane/chemistry/drug effects\r\nDepression/blood/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/blood/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/blood/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nErythrocytes/chemistry/*drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nPatient Compliance\r\nPhospholipids/*chemistry\r\n*Quality of Life","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rondanelli M, Giacosa A, Opizzi A, Pelucchi C, La Vecchia C, Montorfano G, Negroni M, Berra B, Politi P, and Rizzo AM (2010) Effect of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation on depressive symptoms and on health-related quality of life in the treatment of elderly women with depression: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial..

We have critically reviewed the double blind placebo controlled clinical trials published prior to April 2007 to determine whether omega-3 PUFA are likely to be efficacious in these disorders. RESULTS: Most trials involved a small number of participants but were largely well designed. Omega-3 PUFA were well tolerated by both children and adults with mild gastrointestinal effects being the only consistently reported adverse event. For schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder we found little evidence of a robust clinically relevant effect. In the case of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and related disorders, most trials showed at most small benefits over placebo. A limited meta-analysis of these trials suggested that benefits of omega-3 PUFA supplementation may be greater in a classroom setting than at home. Some evidence indicates that omega-3 PUFA may reduce symptoms of anxiety although the data is preliminary and inconclusive. The most convincing evidence for beneficial effects of omega-3 PUFA is to be found in mood disorders. A meta-analysis of trials involving patients with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder provided evidence that omega-3 PUFA supplementation reduces symptoms of depression. Furthermore, meta-regression analysis suggests that supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid may be more beneficial in mood disorders than with docosahexaenoic acid, although several confounding factors prevented a definitive conclusion being made regarding which species of omega-3 PUFA is most beneficial. The mechanisms underlying the apparent efficacy of omega-3 PUFA in mood disorders compared to schizophrenia are discussed as is a rational for the possibly greater efficacy of EPA compared to DHA. CONCLUSION: While it is not currently possible to recommend omega-3 PUFA as either a mono- or adjunctive-therapy in any mental illness, the available evidence is strong enough to justify continued study, especially with regard to attentional, anxiety and mood disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ross BM ; Seguin J ; Sieswerda LE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1476-511X-6-21 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/classification/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nMeta-Analysis as Topic\r\nPersonality\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ross BM, Seguin J, and Sieswerda LE (2007) Omega-3 fatty acids as treatments for mental illness: which disorder and which fatty acid?.

Current treatments have limited efficacy in many patients highlighting a need for new therapeutic approaches to be explored. Anxiety disorders exhibit marked comorbity with mood disorders suggesting the existence of mechanistic similarities. Such a notion is supported by observations that some conventional pharmacotherapies are both effective antidepressants and anxiolytics. As such, given that omega-3 PUFA supplementation may be effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder it is reasonable to propose that they may also possess anxiolytic properties. Experimental data in support of such a hypothesis is currently lacking although reduced abundance of omega-3 PUFA have been reported in patients with anxiety, while supplementation with omega-3 PUFA appears to inhibit activation of the HPA axis and can ameliorate some of the symptoms of anxiety. Clinical investigations carried out to date have, however, involved small numbers of participants. Larger trials using a variety of omega-3 PUFA species in clinically well-defined patients with anxiety will be required to demonstrate a therapeutic role for omega-3 PUFA in these disorders. Given the excellent side effect profile of omega-3 PUFA as well as their strong theoretical rationale, such future trials appear justified.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ross BM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.plefa.2009.10.004 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnti-Anxiety Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety Disorders/diet therapy/epidemiology/*etiology\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nComorbidity\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*physiology/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMood Disorders/diet therapy/epidemiology/etiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ross BM (2009) Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and anxiety disorders..

It was suggested that the Gardenia jasminoides oil extract (oil from Fructus Gardeniae [OFG]) might serve as a potential treatment for depression, whereas its pathogenesis still remained not fully understood. The present research was conducted to evaluate the anti-depressive effect of OFG in mice and explore its potential mechanism. The OFG and ketamine (KET) were intragastrically and intraperitoneally treated, respectively. Thereafter, the animals were subjected to the behavior tests. The expressions of protein kinase A (PKA), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in hippocampus were detected by Western blot. The selective PKA inhibitor H-89 was also applied to confirm the mechanism. As a result, OFG and KET treatment improved the behavior performance. Furthermore, the administrations of OFG effectively enhanced the expressions of PKA, p-CREB, and BDNF. With the application of selective PKA inhibitor H-89, the ameliorated effects caused by OFG were blocked, but not by KET. In conclusion, the presented work indicated that OFG-exerted protective effect on depression through PKA-CREB-BDNF signaling.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ruan J ; Liu L ; Shan X ; Xia B ; Fu Q ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1042/BSR20190141 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*genetics\r\nCyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*genetics\r\nCyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*genetics\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFruit/chemistry\r\nGardenia/*chemistry\r\nGene Expression Regulation/drug effects\r\nHippocampus/drug effects\r\nIsoquinolines/pharmacology\r\nKetamine/pharmacology\r\nMedicine, Chinese Traditional\r\nMice\r\nPlant Oils/chemistry/pharmacology\r\nPlants, Medicinal/chemistry\r\nSulfonamides/pharmacology\r\nDepression\r\nGardenia jasminoides oil extract\r\nPKA/CREB/BDNF","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ruan J, Liu L, Shan X, Xia B, and Fu Q (2019) Anti-depressant effects of oil from fructus gardeniae via PKA-CREB-BDNF signaling..

The discovery that a different microbial composition can influence behavior and cognition, and in turn the nervous system can indirectly influence enteric microbiota composition, has significantly contributed to establish the well-accepted concept of gut-brain axis. This hypothesis is supported by several evidence showing mutual mechanisms, which involve the vague nerve, the immune system, the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis modulation and the bacteria-derived metabolites. Many studies have focused on delineating a role for this axis in health and disease, ranging from stress-related disorders such as depression, anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, and to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson Disease, Alzheimer's Disease etc. Based on this background, and considering the relevance of alteration of the symbiotic state between host and microbiota, this review focuses on the role and the involvement of bioactive lipids, such as the N-acylethanolamine (NAE) family whose main members are N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoilethanolamide (OEA), and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, belonging to a large group of bioactive lipids able to modulate peripheral and central pathologic processes. Their effective role has been studied in inflammation, acute and chronic pain, obesity and central nervous system diseases. A possible correlation has been shown between these lipids and gut microbiota through different mechanisms. Indeed, systemic administration of specific bacteria can reduce abdominal pain through the involvement of cannabinoid receptor 1 in the rat; on the other hand, PEA reduces inflammation markers in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and butyrate, producted by gut microbiota, is effective in reducing inflammation and pain in irritable bowel syndrome and IBD animal models. In this review, we underline the relationship among inflammation, pain, microbiota and the different lipids, focusing on a possible involvement of NAEs and SCFAs in the gut-brain axis and their role in the central nervous system diseases.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Russo R ; Cristiano C ; Avagliano C ; De Caro C ; La Rana G ; Raso GM ; Canani RB ; Meli R ; Calignano A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/0929867324666170216113756 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nCentral Nervous System Diseases/drug therapy/metabolism/*physiopathology\r\nDysbiosis/drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nEndocannabinoids/metabolism/physiology\r\nEthanolamines/metabolism\r\nFatty Acids, Volatile/metabolism/physiology/therapeutic use\r\nGastrointestinal Microbiome/drug effects/physiology\r\nHumans\r\nInflammation/drug therapy/metabolism/*physiopathology\r\nIntestinal Diseases/drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nLipids/*physiology/therapeutic use\r\nPain/drug therapy/metabolism/*physiopathology\r\nAEA\r\nGut\r\nIBS\r\nPEA\r\nbrain\r\nbutyrate\r\ninflammation\r\nmood\r\nneurodegenerative disease\r\npain.","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Russo R, Cristiano C, Avagliano C, De Caro C, La Rana G, Raso GM, Canani RB, Meli R, and Calignano A (2018) Gut-brain Axis: Role of Lipids in the Regulation of Inflammation, Pain and CNS Diseases..

Mechanistic studies have shown how omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), like those found in fish oil, can modulate key pathways involved in inflammation, sympathetic activity, oxidative stress, transcription factors, and inflammatory cytokine production. Objective • The research team intended to investigate the effects that PUFAs have on the brain and the immune system, including the effects of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress, and their therapeutic benefits in major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder, either as an alternative monotherapy or a complementary adjunct treatment. Design • A literature search was conducted through PubMed and Google Scholar, with no restrictions on the publication dates or geographically. Setting • The research occurred at research facilities in Washington, DC, and Davis, California. Results • Well-described links between inflammation and MDD and bipolar disorder have been established. Similarly, a highly inflammatory state is a contributing factor to many significant health complications, and omega-3 PUFAs can help treat those issues. Conclusions • The research team concluded that omega-3 fatty acids have therapeutic benefits in the treatment of both MDD and bipolar disorder and are effective as a monotherapy and, particularly, as an adjunct therapy. The efficacy of omega-3 supplementation is clearly useful in promoting better health overall and supplementation should be encouraged in the primary care setting. A meta-analysis exploring an adjunct treatment of supplemental eicosapentaenoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid is likely to yield the greatest benefits to psychiatric conditions and provide an answer to proper dosing regimens.

Evidence from epidemiological studies highlights the cardioprotective attributes of diets rich in fish, especially oil-rich fish. Data from intervention trials are consistent in suggesting that LC n-3 PUFA lower the risk of CVD, probably by the multiple mechanisms of lowering serum triacylglycerols, improving the LDL:HDL ratio, anti-arrhythmic effects on heart muscle, improved plaque stability, anti-thrombotic effects and reduced endothelial activation. Research indicates LC n-3 PUFA provision has an impact during development, and there is preliminary evidence that docosahexaenoic acid supplementation during pregnancy could optimise brain and retina development in the infant. LC n-3 PUFA are also postulated to ameliorate behavioural and mental health disturbances such as depression, schizophrenia, dementia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, despite some positive evidence in each of these areas, use of LC n-3 PUFA in these conditions remains at the experimental stage. In the case of immune function, there is little doubt that LC n-3 PUFA have a positive effect. Although intervention trials in rheumatoid arthritis show strong evidence of benefit, evidence for efficacy in other inflammatory conditions, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis and asthma, is inconsistent or inadequate. More promising evidence in some conditions may come from studies which attempt to modify the fetal environment using LC n-3 PUFA supplementation during pregnancy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ruxton CH ; Calder PC ; Reed SC ; Simpson MJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1079/NRR200497 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ruxton CH, Calder PC, Reed SC, and Simpson MJ (2005) The impact of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on human health..

As supplementation with omega 3 has been considered effective in the treatment of many diseases especially mental disorders, this study aimed at evaluating the effect of omega 3 with fluvoxamine compared with fluvoxamine alone in the treatment of the deep depression phase in bipolar patients type I. METHODS: A total of 80 patients in this clinical trial study were selected using a randomized controlled trial in two case and control groups by a psychiatrist. The case group took fluvoxamine and omega 3 tablets and the control group took only fluvoxamine. Patients completed the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and demographic questionnaire at the beginning of the study and after 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. RESULTS: The mean scores in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale in both groups under study after 2, 4, 8, 12 weeks decreased. Statistics showed a significant difference in scores in both groups before the treatment and after mentioned weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Since research findings showed the effectiveness of omega 3 and its harmlessness, it is suggested that omega 3 can be prescribed with other antidepressant medications.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Safa M ; Fallah Tafti S; Ghassem Boroujerdi F; Talischi F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/2045125312471667 ","Keywords":"depression\r\nfatty acids\r\nfluvoxamine\r\nomega 3\r\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Safa M, Fallah Tafti S, Ghassem Boroujerdi F, and Talischi F (2013) Clinical trial in the treatment of 80 Iranian patients with major depression disorder by the combination of omega 3 fatty acid and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor..

After long period of exposure to stressors, including restrained stress, depressive-like behavior can be produced. BEO has been suggested to reduce depression. However, there is no scientific evidence supporting this property. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of BEO in chronic stressed rats on: 1) behavior related depressive disorder, 2) hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis response, and iii) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels in hippocampus. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Male Wistar rats, weighing 200 to 250 g, were induced chronic restrained stress 15 minutes dailyfor two weeks. For the next two weeks, these rats were divided intofour groups, control-i.p., fluoxetine-i.p., control-inhale, and BEO-inhale. Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg i.p.) or saline was intraperitoneally administered daily while 2.5% BEO or saline was inhaled daily. At the end of the treatment, rats were assessed for depressive-like behavior using the forced swimming test (FST). After the behavioral test, the animals were immediately decapitated and trunk blood samples were collected for the measurement ofcorticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels and hippocampus was dissected and stored in afreezer at -80 °C until assay for BDNF protein. RESULTS: BEO andfluoxetine significantly decreased the immobility time in the FST (p < 0.05). Fluoxetine tended to decrease serum corticosterone and significantly (p < 0.05) decreased serum ACTH while BEO had no effect on these two stress hormones. For BDNF protein determination, neither BEO norfluoxetine had any effect on BDNF protein levels in hippocampus compared to their controls. CONCLUSION: The inhalation ofBEO decrease behavior related depressive disorder similar tofluoxetine but has no effect on HPA axis response and BDNF protein levels in chronic restrained stress.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Saiyudthong S ; Mekseepralard C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nCorticosterone/blood\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy\r\nHippocampus/metabolism\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nOils, Volatile/pharmacology\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System/drug effects\r\nPlant Oils/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nStress, Psychological/*drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Saiyudthong S, and Mekseepralard C (2015) Effect of Inhaling Bergamot Oil on Depression-Related Behaviors in Chronic Stressed Rats..

Omega-3 FA are of interest in some of the most common conditions affecting women. One mechanism underlying dysmenorrhea is a disturbed balance between antiinflammatory, vasodilator eicosanoids derived from omega-3 FA and proinflammatory, vasoconstrictor eicosanoids derived from omega-6 FA. Increased intake of omega-3 FA can reverse the symptoms in this condition by decreasing the amount of omega-6 FA in cell membranes. An increased prostacyclin/thromboxane ratio induced by omega-3 FA can facilitate pregnancy in women with infertility problems by increasing uterine blood flow. Supplementation with omega-3 FA during pregnancy lowers the risk of premature birth and can increase the length of pregnancy and birth weight by altering the balance of eicosanoids involved in labor and promote fetal growth by improving placental blood flow. Intake of omega-3 FA during pregnancy and breast feeding may facilitate the child's brain development. There is also some evidence that supplementation with omega-3 FA might help to prevent preeclampsia, postpartum depression, menopausal problems, postmenopausal osteoporosis, and breast cancer. Furthermore, because elevated triglyceride levels are associated with cardiovascular disease, especially in women; and because omega-3 FA have powerful effects on triglycerides, women in particular gain from an increased intake of these fatty acids. This is especially important in women receiving hormone therapy, which can increase triglyceride levels. The quality of the omega-3 FA preparation is important. It should have an appropriate antioxidant content not to induce lipid peroxidation, and its content of dioxin and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) should be well below the established safe limit.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Saldeen P ; Saldeen T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/01.ogx.0000140038.70473.96 ","Keywords":"Brain/embryology/growth & development\r\nBreast Neoplasms/diet therapy/etiology/prevention & control\r\nCardiovascular Diseases/prevention & control\r\nDepression, Postpartum/etiology\r\nDiabetes, Gestational/prevention & control\r\nDysmenorrhea/etiology\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/*metabolism/standards\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-6/adverse effects/metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nHormone Replacement Therapy/adverse effects\r\nHumans\r\nInfertility/etiology\r\nMenopause/metabolism\r\nObstetric Labor, Premature/etiology\r\nOsteoporosis/prevention & control\r\nPre-Eclampsia/prevention & control\r\nPregnancy\r\nTriglycerides/blood\r\n*Women's Health","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Saldeen P, and Saldeen T (2004) Women and omega-3 Fatty acids..

Aromatherapy, a practice that uses essential oils for preventive and therapeutic purposes, represents a promising therapeutic alternative for the alleviation of depressive symptoms. Lavender essential oil (LEO) has been the focus of clinical studies due to its positive effect on mood. An animal model of chronic administration of high dose corticosterone to induce depression- and anxiety-like behavior and reduced neurogenesis was used to explore the biological changes brought by aromatherapy. Twenty-four adult male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned into four groups: Control, corticosterone (Cort) group with high dose of corticosterone, LEO group with daily exposure to LEO by inhalation, and LEO + Cort. At the end of the 14-day treatment period, behavioral tests were carried out. Serum samples were collected 2-3 days after the 14-day period treatment and before perfusion to carry out biochemical analyses to measure BDNF, corticosterone and oxytocin. After perfusion, brains were collected for immunohistochemical analysis to detect BrdU and DCX positive cells in the hippocampus and subventricular zone. Results showed that treatment with LEO ameliorated the depression-like behavior induced by the chronic administration of corticosterone as observed in the LEO + Cort group. Cort treatment reduced the number of BrdU positive cells in the hippocampus and the subventricular zone. Treatment with LEO prevented the corticosterone-induced reduction in the number of BrdU positive cells (LEO + Cort group) demonstrating the neurogenic effect of LEO under high corticosterone conditions. Chronic administration of high dose of corticosterone significantly reduced the dendritic complexity of immature neurons. On the contrary, treatment with LEO increased dendritic complexity of immature neurons under high corticosterone conditions (LEO + Cort group). The improved neurogenesis and dendritic complexity observed in the LEO + Cort group demonstrated a clear restorative effect of LEO under high corticosterone conditions. However, 2-3 days after the treatment, the levels of BDNF were upregulated in the LEO and LEO + Cort groups. Furthermore, the concentration of oxytocin in serum, 2-3 days after the treatment, showed to be upregulated in the LEO group alone. The present study has provided evidence of the biological effect of LEO on neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. Also, this study contributes to the understanding of the mechanism of action of LEO in an animal model where depression- and anxiety-like behavior and reduced neurogenesis were induced by high corticosterone administration.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sánchez-Vidaña DI ; Po KK ; Fung TK ; Chow JK ; Lau WK ; So PK ; Lau BW ; Tsang HW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neulet.2019.02.042 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnxiety/chemically induced/*pathology/*psychology\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nCorticosterone\r\nDendrites/*drug effects/pathology\r\nDepression/chemically induced/*pathology/*psychology\r\nDoublecortin Protein\r\nLavandula/*chemistry\r\nMale\r\nNeurogenesis\r\nNeuronal Plasticity/drug effects\r\nOils, Volatile/*pharmacology\r\nPlant Oils/*pharmacology\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nAnxiety\r\nAromatherapy\r\nDepression\r\nLavender\r\nNeurogenesis\r\nOxytocin","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sánchez-Vidaña DI, Po KK, Fung TK, Chow JK, Lau WK, So PK, Lau BW, and Tsang HW (2019) Lavender essential oil ameliorates depression-like behavior and increases neurogenesis and dendritic complexity in rats..

The aim of this study was to assess the role of a nutritional intervention based on a Mediterranean diet (MeDiet) on plasma BDNF levels. METHODS: PREvención con Dieta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) is a randomized clinical trial designed to assess the effect of a Mediterranean diet (MeDiet) on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. For this analysis, 243 participants from the Navarra centre were randomly selected. Participants were assigned to one of three dietary interventions: control (low-fat) diet, MeDiet supplemented with virgin olive oil (MeDiet+VOO), or MeDiet supplemented with nuts (MeDiet+Nuts). Plasma BDNF levels were measured after 3 years of intervention. Multivariate-adjusted means of BDNF for each intervention were compared using generalized linear models. Logistic regression models were fit to assess the association between the dietary intervention and the likelihood to have low plasma BDNF values (<13 µg/ml, 10th percentile). Analyses were repeated after stratifying the sample according to baseline prevalence of different diseases. RESULTS: Higher but non-significant plasma BDNF levels were observed for participants assigned to both MeDiets. Participants assigned to MeDiet+Nuts showed a significant lower risk (odds ratios (OR)=0.22; 95% confidence intervals (CI)=0.05-0.90) of low plasma BDNF values (<13 µg/ml) as compared to the control group. Among participants with prevalent depression at baseline, significantly higher BDNF levels were found for those assigned to the MeDiet+Nuts. DISCUSSION: Adherence to a MeDiet was associated to an improvement in plasma BDNF concentrations in individuals with depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sánchez-Villegas A ; Galbete C ; Martinez-González MA ; Martinez JA ; Razquin C ; Salas-Salvadó J ; Estruch R ; Buil-Cosiales P ; Martí A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1179/1476830511Y.0000000011 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*blood\r\nCardiovascular Diseases/diet therapy/epidemiology/*prevention & control\r\nDepressive Disorder/*diet therapy/epidemiology/*metabolism\r\nDiet, Fat-Restricted\r\n*Diet, Mediterranean\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMultivariate Analysis\r\nOlive Oil\r\nPlant Oils/administration & dosage\r\nRisk Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sánchez-Villegas A, Galbete C, Martinez-González MA, Martinez JA, Razquin C, Salas-Salvadó J, Estruch R, Buil-Cosiales P, and Martí A (2011) The effect of the Mediterranean diet on plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels: the PREDIMED-NAVARRA randomized trial..

Randomized trials with an intervention based on this dietary pattern could provide the most definitive answer to the findings reported by observational studies. The aim of this study was to compare in a randomized trial the effects of two Mediterranean diets versus a low-fat diet on depression risk after at least 3 years of intervention. METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, primary prevention field trial of cardiovascular disease (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED Study)) based on community-dwelling men aged 55 to 80 years and women aged 60 to 80 years at high risk of cardiovascular disease (51% of them had type 2 diabetes; DM2) attending primary care centers affiliated with 11 Spanish teaching hospitals. Primary analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Cox regression models were used to assess the relationship between the nutritional intervention groups and the incidence of depression. RESULTS: We identified 224 new cases of depression during follow-up. There was an inverse association with depression for participants assigned to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts (multivariate hazard ratio (HR) 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.10) compared with participants assigned to the control group, although this was not significant. However, when the analysis was restricted to participants with DM2, the magnitude of the effect of the intervention with the Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts did reach statistical significance (multivariate HR = 0.59; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: The result suggest that a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts could exert a beneficial effect on the risk of depression in patients with DM2. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been registered in the Current Controlled Trials with the number ISRCTN 35739639.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sánchez-Villegas A ; Martínez-González MA ; Estruch R ; Salas-Salvadó J ; Corella D ; Covas MI ; Arós F ; Romaguera D ; Gómez-Gracia E ; Lapetra J ; Pintó X ; Martínez JA ; Lamuela-Raventós RM ; Ros E ; Gea A ; Wärnberg J ; Serra-Majem L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1741-7015-11-208 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nCardiovascular Diseases/prevention & control\r\nDepression/*prevention & control\r\nDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/diet therapy/psychology\r\n*Diet, Mediterranean\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNuts\r\nOlive Oil\r\nPlant Oils\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSpain/epidemiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sánchez-Villegas A, Martínez-González MA, Estruch R, Salas-Salvadó J, Corella D, Covas MI, Arós F, Romaguera D, Gómez-Gracia E, Lapetra J, Pintó X, Martínez JA, Lamuela-Raventós RM, Ros E, Gea A, Wärnberg J, and Serra-Majem L (2013) Mediterranean dietary pattern and depression: the PREDIMED randomized trial..

It revealed a number of significant conclusions. Interestingly, more positive clinical trials were found to support adjuvant, rather than monotherapeutic, use of nutrients to treat depression. Much evidence exists in the area of adjuvant application of folic acid, S-adenosyl-methionine, omega-3, and L-tryptophan with antidepressants. Current evidence does not support omega-3 as an effective monotherapy to treat depression. However, this may be due, at least in part, to olive oil being used as the control intervention, some studies using docosahexaenoic acid alone or a higher docosahexaenoic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid ratio, and significant heterogeneity regarding depressive populations. Nevertheless, adjunctive prescription of omega-3 with antidepressants, or in people with dietary deficiency, may be beneficial. Inositol lacks evidence as an effective antidepressant and cannot be currently recommended. Evidence on the use of L-tryptophan for depression is inconclusive, and additional studies utilizing a more robust methodology are required.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sarris J ; Schoendorfer N ; Kavanagh DJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1753-4887.2009.00180.x ","Keywords":"Amino Acids/administration & dosage\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage\r\nChemotherapy, Adjuvant\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/administration & dosage\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/administration & dosage\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage\r\nFolic Acid/administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\n*Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nNutritional Status\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/administration & dosage\r\nTryptophan/administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sarris J, Schoendorfer N, and Kavanagh DJ (2009) Major depressive disorder and nutritional medicine: a review of monotherapies and adjuvant treatments..

Recent evidence suggests that synthetic antidepressants- although effective in the treatment of severe depressed mood-may have only a weak effect against mild-moderate forms of depression. In such cases, nonpharmaceutical options may be indicated. Furthermore, research findings suggest that select natural products are effective adjuvants when combined with synthetic antidepressants. Research concerning the treatment of depression emphasizes individual monotherapies, which is often incongruent with clinical reality. In practice, clinicians often use a variety of interventions; however, this approach may not be systematic, and many interventions used may not be based on strong evidence. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: This article proposes an evidence-based prescriptive clinical model based on the biopsychosocial model to treat unipolar depression. The \"Antidepressant-Lifestyle- Psychological-Social (ALPS) depression treatment model\" integrates nonpharmacological interventions (such as complementary medicines, lifestyle advice, and psychosocial techniques) for use by clinicians. RESULTS: Initially a review of nonpharmacological mood-elevating interventions was undertaken. Evidentiary support was revealed for use of psychological techniques such as cognitive and behavioral medicine and interpersonal therapy, St John's wort, S-adenosyl methionine, and aerobic and anaerobic exercise. There were inconsistent research findings for acupuncture, omega-3 fish oils, and L-tryptophan for depressed mood. From these evidencebased interventions an integrative model was formed. Clinical recommendations in addition to a practical stepped-care decision tree are outlined. CONCLUSION: The ALPS model has the potential to improve treatment outcomes and reduce relapse rates in clinical depression and warrants research using rigorous and appropriate methodology.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sarris J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"5-Hydroxytryptophan/therapeutic use\r\nComplementary Therapies/*methods\r\nDepressive Disorder/psychology/*therapy\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFolic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nHypericum\r\nIntegrative Medicine/*methods\r\n*Life Style\r\nPhytotherapy/methods\r\nQuality of Life\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sarris J (2011) Clinical depression: an evidence-based integrative complementary medicine treatment model..

Population surveys show that persons with BD often self-medicate with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) or integrative therapies in spite of limited research evidence supporting their use. To date, no review has focused specifically on nonconventional treatments of BD. OBJECTIVES: The study objectives were to present a review of nonconventional (complementary and integrative) interventions examined in clinical trials on BD, and to offer provisional guidelines for the judicious integrative use of CAM in the management of BD. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL,(®) Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for human clinical trials in English during mid-2010 using Bipolar Disorder and CAM therapy and CAM medicine search terms. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were also calculated where data were available. RESULTS: Several positive high-quality studies on nutrients in combination with conventional mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications in BD depression were identified, while branched-chain amino acids and magnesium were effective (small studies) in attenuating mania in BD. In the treatment of bipolar depression, evidence was mixed regarding omega-3, while isolated studies provide provisional support for a multinutrient formula, n-acetylcysteine, and l-tryptophan. In one study, acupuncture was found to have favorable but nonsignificant effects on mania and depression outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supports the integrative treatment of BD using combinations of mood stabilizers and select nutrients. Other CAM or integrative modalities used to treat BD have not been adequately explored to date; however, some early findings are promising. Select CAM and integrative interventions add to established conventional treatment of BD and may be considered when formulating a treatment plan. It is hoped that the safety issues and clinical considerations addressed in this article may encourage the practice of safety-conscious and evidence-based integrative management of BD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sarris J ; Lake J ; Hoenders R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1089/acm.2010.0481 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/therapeutic use\r\nAcupuncture Therapy\r\nAmino Acids, Branched-Chain/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/therapy\r\n*Complementary Therapies/adverse effects\r\n*Dietary Supplements/adverse effects\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\n*Integrative Medicine\r\nMagnesium/therapeutic use\r\nMicronutrients/therapeutic use\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/therapeutic use\r\nTryptophan/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sarris J, Lake J, and Hoenders R (2011) Bipolar disorder and complementary medicine: current evidence, safety issues, and clinical considerations..

To date, however, no specialized systematic review of this area has been conducted. We present the first systematic review of clinical trials using nutrient-based nutraceuticals in combination with standard pharmacotherapies to treat BD. A subsequent aim of this report was to discuss posited underlying mechanisms of action. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases, and grey literature were searched during mid-2010 for human clinical trials in English using nutraceuticals such as omega-3, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), inositol, and vitamins and minerals, in combination with pharmacotherapies to treat bipolar mania and bipolar depression. A review of the results including an effect size analysis (Cohen's d) was subsequently conducted. RESULTS: In treating bipolar depression, positive evidence with large effect sizes were found for NAC (d=1.04) and a chelated mineral and vitamin formula (d=1.70). On the outcome of bipolar mania, several nutraceuticals reduced mania with strong clinical effects: a chelated mineral formula (d=0.83), L-tryptophan (d=1.47), magnesium (d=1.44), folic acid (d=0.40), and branched-chain amino acids (d=1.60). Mixed, but mainly positive, evidence was found for omega-3 for bipolar depression, while no evidentiary support was found for use in mania. No significant effect on BD outcome scales was found for inositol (possibly due to small samples).

Thus, we present the significant findings from meta-analyses of omega-3 in the treatment of bipolar depression and bipolar mania. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for clinical trials up to September 1, 2010, using the search terms bipolar disorder OR bipolar depression OR bipolar mania OR mania OR hypomania OR cyclothymia with the search terms omega 3 OR essential fatty acids OR polyunsaturated fatty acids OR DHA OR EPA OR fish oil OR flax oil. Clinical trial registries and gray literature (published or unpublished data not readily accessible via main databases) were also searched. DATA SELECTION: The analysis included randomized controlled studies 4 weeks or longer, with a sample size > 10, written in English, using omega-3 for diagnosed bipolar depression or mania. No criteria were set for age, gender, or ethnicity. DATA EXTRACTION: A random-effects model was used. The model analyzed the standard mean difference between treatment and placebo between baseline and endpoint, combining the effect size (Hedges g) data. Funnel plot and heterogeneity analyses (I²) were also performed. DATA SYNTHESIS: The findings of 5 pooled datasets (n = 291) on the outcome of bipolar depression revealed a significant effect in favor of omega-3 (P = .029), with a moderate effect size of 0.34. On the outcome of mania, 5 pooled datasets (n = 291) revealed a nonsignificant effect in favor of omega-3 (P = .099), with an effect size of 0.20. Minor heterogeneity between studies on the outcome of bipolar depression was found (I² = 30%; P = .213), which was not present on the outcome of bipolar mania (I² = 0%; P = .98). Funnel plot symmetry suggested no significant likelihood of publication bias. Meta-regression analysis between sample size and effect size, however, revealed that studies with smaller sample sizes had larger effect sizes (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analytic findings provide strong evidence that bipolar depressive symptoms may be improved by adjunctive use of omega-3. The evidence, however, does not support its adjunctive use in attenuating mania.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sarris J ; Mischoulon D ; Schweitzer I ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.10r06710 ","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*diet therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\n*Models, Statistical\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sarris J, Mischoulon D, and Schweitzer I (2012) Omega-3 for bipolar disorder: meta-analyses of use in mania and bipolar depression..

To address this, the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Disorders (CANMAT) convened an international taskforce involving 31 leading academics and clinicians from 15 countries, between 2019 and 2021. These guidelines are aimed at providing a definitive evidence-informed approach to assist clinicians in making decisions around the use of such agents for major psychiatric disorders. We also provide detail on safety and tolerability, and clinical advice regarding prescription (e.g. indications, dosage), in addition to consideration for use in specialised populations. METHODS: The methodology was based on the WFSBP guidelines development process. Evidence was assessed based on the WFSBP grading of evidence (and was modified to focus on Grade A level evidence - meta-analysis or two or more RCTs - due to the breadth of data available across all nutraceuticals and phytoceuticals across major psychiatric disorders). The taskforce assessed both the 'level of evidence' (LoE) (i.e. meta-analyses or RCTs) and the assessment of the direction of the evidence, to determine whether the intervention was 'Recommended' (+++), 'Provisionally Recommended' (++), 'Weakly Recommended' (+), 'Not Currently Recommended' (+/-), or 'Not Recommended' (-) for a particular condition. Due to the number of clinical trials now available in the field, we firstly examined the data from our two meta-reviews of meta-analyses (nutraceuticals conducted in 2019, and phytoceuticals in 2020). We then performed a search of additional relevant RCTs and reported on both these data as the primary drivers supporting our clinical recommendations. Lower levels of evidence, including isolated RCTs, open label studies, case studies, preclinical research, and interventions with only traditional or anecdotal use, were not assessed. RESULTS: Amongst nutraceuticals with Grade A evidence, positive directionality and varying levels of support (recommended, provisionally recommended, or weakly recommended) was found for adjunctive omega-3 fatty acids (+++), vitamin D (+), adjunctive probiotics (++), adjunctive zinc (++), methylfolate (+), and adjunctive s-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) (+) in the treatment of unipolar depression. Monotherapy omega-3 (+/-), folic acid (-), vitamin C (-), tryptophan (+/-), creatine (+/-), inositol (-), magnesium (-), and n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) (+/-) and SAMe (+/-) were not supported for this use. In bipolar disorder, omega-3 had weak support for bipolar depression (+), while NAC was not currently recommended (+/-). NAC was weakly recommended (+) in the treatment of OCD-related disorders; however, no other nutraceutical had sufficient evidence in any anxiety-related disorder. Vitamin D (+), NAC (++), methylfolate (++) were recommended to varying degrees in the treatment of the negative symptoms in schizophrenia, while omega-3 fatty acids were not, although evidence suggests a role for prevention of transition to psychosis in high-risk youth, with potential pre-existing fatty acid deficiency. Micronutrients (+) and vitamin D (+) were weakly supported in the treatment of ADHD, while omega-3 (+/-) and omega-9 fatty acids (-), acetyl L carnitine (-), and zinc (+/-) were not supported. Phytoceuticals with supporting Grade A evidence and positive directionality included St John's wort (+++), saffron (++), curcumin (++), and lavender (+) in the treatment of unipolar depression, while rhodiola use was not supported for use in mood disorders. Ashwagandha (++), galphimia (+), and lavender (++) were modestly supported in the treatment of anxiety disorders, while kava (-) and chamomile (+/-) were not recommended for generalised anxiety disorder. Ginkgo was weakly supported in the adjunctive treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia (+), but not supported in the treatment of ADHD (+/-). With respect to safety and tolerability, all interventions were deemed to have varying acceptable levels of safety and tolerability for low-risk over-the-counter use in most circumstances. Quality and standardisation of phytoceuticals was also raised by the taskforce as a key limiting issue for firmer confidence in these agents. Finally, the taskforce noted that such use of nutraceuticals or phytoceuticals be primarily recommended (where supportive evidence exists) adjunctively within a standard medical/health professional care model, especially in cases of more severe mental illness. Some meta-analyses reviewed contained data from heterogenous studies involving poor methodology. Isolated RCTs and other data such as open label or case series were not included, and it is recognised that an absence of data does not imply lack of efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current data and clinician input, a range of nutraceuticals and phytoceuticals were given either a supportive recommendation or a provisional recommendation across a range of various psychiatric disorders. However several had only a weak endorsement for potential use; for a few it was not possible to reach a clear recommendation direction, largely due to mixed study findings; while some other agents showed no obvious therapeutic benefit and were clearly not recommended for use. It is the intention of these guidelines to inform psychiatric/medical, and health professional practice globally.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sarris J ; Ravindran A ; Yatham LN ; Marx W ; Rucklidge JJ ; McIntyre RS ; Akhondzadeh S ; Benedetti F ; Caneo C ; Cramer H ; Cribb L ; de Manincor M ; Dean O ; Deslandes AC ; Freeman MP ; Gangadhar B ; Harvey BH ; Kasper S ; Lake J ; Lopresti A ; Lu L ; Metri NJ ; Mischoulon D ; Ng CH ; Nishi D ; Rahimi R ; Seedat S ; Sinclair J ; Su KP ; Zhang ZJ ; Berk M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15622975.2021.2013041 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nHumans\r\n*Biological Psychiatry\r\nCanada\r\n*Mental Disorders/drug therapy\r\nAnxiety\r\nDietary Supplements\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3\r\nVitamin D\r\nZinc\r\nADHD\r\nNutrients\r\naffective disorders\r\nherbal medicines\r\nschizophrenia","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sarris J, Ravindran A, Yatham LN, Marx W, Rucklidge JJ, McIntyre RS, Akhondzadeh S, Benedetti F, Caneo C, Cramer H, Cribb L, de Manincor M, Dean O, Deslandes AC, Freeman MP, Gangadhar B, Harvey BH, Kasper S, Lake J, Lopresti A, Lu L, Metri NJ, Mischoulon D, Ng CH, Nishi D, Rahimi R, Seedat S, Sinclair J, Su KP, Zhang ZJ, and Berk M (2022) Clinician guidelines for the treatment of psychiatric disorders with nutraceuticals and phytoceuticals: The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce..

The use of essential oils is ancient, and has prevailed in different cultures around the world, such as those of the Egyptians, Greeks, Persians, and Chinese. Today, essential oils are used in traditional and complimentary medicines, aromatherapy, massage therapies, cosmetics, perfumes and food industries. The screening effect of essential oils has been studied worldwide. They demonstrate a range of biological activities, such as antiparasitic, antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiaging, and neuroprotective properties. In this scoping review, we provide a 10-year updated comprehensive assessment of volatile oils and their effects on the nervous system. MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar were systematically and strategically searched for original studies investigating these effects from 2012 to 2022. Approximately seventy studies were selected as included studies. Among these studies, several outcomes were reported, including antistress, antianxiety, analgesic, cognitive, and autonomic effects. Some essential oils showed developmental benefits, with the potential to induce neurite outgrowth. The neurotransmitter receptor level can also be modified by essential oil application. Physiological and pathophysiological outcome measures were reported. For physiological outcomes, arousal, cognitive performance, circadian eating behavior, emotional modulation, consumer acceptance, preferences, and willingness to buy were investigated. For pathophysiological conditions, pain, depression, anxiety, stress, sleep disorder, mental fatigue, agitated behavior, and quality of life were measured. In conclusion, essential oils showed promising effects on the nervous system, which can be further applied to their use in functional foods, drinks, and alternative therapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sattayakhom A ; Wichit S ; Koomhin P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/molecules28093771 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\n*Oils, Volatile/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nQuality of Life\r\n*Aromatherapy\r\nAnxiety\r\n*Central Nervous System Depressants\r\nNervous System\r\naromatherapy\r\nessential oil\r\nthe nervous system","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sattayakhom A, Wichit S, and Koomhin P (2023) The Effects of Essential Oils on the Nervous System: A Scoping Review..

The omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolic pathways participate in several inflammatory processes and have been linked through epidemiologic and clinical studies to bipolar disorder and its response to treatment. We review the proposed role of PUFA metabolism in neuroinflammation, modulation of brain PUFA metabolism by antimanic medications in rodent models, and anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapy in bipolar disorder and in major depressive disorder (MDD). Although the convergence of findings between preclinical and postmortem clinical data is compelling, we investigate why human trials of PUFA as treatment are mixed. We view the biomarker and treatment study findings in light of the evidence for the hypothesis that arachidonic acid hypermetabolism contributes to bipolar disorder pathophysiology and propose that a combined high n-3 plus low n-6 diet should be tested as an adjunct to current medication in future trials.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Saunders EF ; Ramsden CE ; Sherazy MS ; Gelenberg AJ ; Davis JM ; Rapoport SI ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.15com10431 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nArachidonic Acid/metabolism\r\nBipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nBrain/drug effects\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/metabolism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-6/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nRats","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Saunders EF, Ramsden CE, Sherazy MS, Gelenberg AJ, Davis JM, and Rapoport SI (2016) Reconsidering Dietary Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Bipolar Disorder: A Translational Picture..

METHODS: This 2-arm, parallel-group, randomized, modified double-blind, controlled 48-week study of 12-week intensive diet intervention in subjects with BD was conducted at a single suburban-rural site in the mid-Atlantic region. Participants with DSM-IV TR BD I or II with hypomanic or depressive symptoms were randomized, stratified on gender (N = 82). The intervention included the provision of group-specific study foods and dietary counseling. Variability of mood symptoms was measured by a twice-daily, 12-week ecological momentary analysis (EMA) paradigm, and group differences were analyzed using multilevel models. Circulating n-3 and n-6 fatty acids were measured at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of diet exposure. RESULTS: All 82 randomized participants were included in biochemical analyses. Seventy participants completed at least 2 EMA surveys and were included in primary EMA analyses. Variability in mood, energy, irritability, and pain as measured using EMA was reduced in the H3-L6 group compared to the CD group. No significant differences in mean ratings of mood symptoms, or any other symptom measures, were detected. The dietary intervention effect on target PUFAs significantly differed by the group over time. CONCLUSIONS: A dietary intervention adjunctive to usual care showed preliminary efficacy in improving variability in mood symptoms in participants with BD.

The supplements included were inositol, vitamin D, folic acid, vitamin B12, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) and zinc. A structured database search (MEDLINE, EBSCO, CENTRAL, Web of Science) was performed using terms for the respective substances in conjunction with terms for depression and the mode of treatment (\"add-on\" OR \"adjunctive\" OR \"augmentation\"). Meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized comparative studies that investigated the supplements as an add-on in the treatment of clinically diagnosed MDD were included. Agents had to be added to an existing antidepressant regime (augmentation) or started simultaneously with the antidepressant (acceleration). For n-3 PUFAs, folic acid and zinc, new meta-analyses were performed as part of this work. Our meta-analyses of 10 articles on n-3 PUFAs and four on zinc support their efficacy. For folic acid, our meta-analysis does not support efficacy. For n-3 PUFAs, sensitivity analysis showed no difference between acceleration and augmentation designs, but significant differences between individuals with or without comorbidities. For the remaining substances, only a few RCTs were available. The preliminary data on inositol was negative, while one RCT for vitamin D demonstrated positive results. For vitamin B12 one and for SAMe two RCTs and a few open trials are available reporting positive and mixed results. To summarize, for most of the substances, the available data is not yet sufficient or inconclusive.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schefft C ; Kilarski LL ; Bschor T ; Köhler S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.euroneuro.2017.07.004 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepressive Disorder/*therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\nAugmentation\r\nEfficacy\r\nNutritional supplements\r\nSystematic review\r\nUnipolar depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schefft C, Kilarski LL, Bschor T, and Köhler S (2017) Efficacy of adding nutritional supplements in unipolar depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis..

This elevation seems to be due to a significantly increased risk of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction and, once the ischemic heart disease is established, sudden cardiac death. Recent data suggest that the increased rates of cardiovascular disease in patients with depression may be the result of one or more still-unrecognized underlying physiological factors that predispose a patient to both depression and cardiovascular disease. Two possibly related factors that may have a causal relation with both depressive disorders and cardiovascular disease are an omega-3 fatty acid deficiency and elevated homocysteine levels. We present the available data connecting cardiovascular disease, depression, omega-3 fatty acids, and homocysteine. In addition, we suggest research strategies and some preliminary treatment recommendations that may reduce the increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients with major depressive disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Severus WE ; Littman AB ; Stoll AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/10673220127910 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nCardiovascular Diseases/genetics/*metabolism/*mortality\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diet therapy/genetics/*metabolism\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*metabolism\r\nFolic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nGenetic Predisposition to Disease\r\nHomocysteine/*adverse effects/blood\r\nHumans\r\nHyperhomocysteinemia/*diet therapy\r\nLipid Peroxidation\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nRats\r\nRisk\r\nVitamin B 12/therapeutic use\r\nVitamin B 6/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Severus WE, Littman AB, and Stoll AL (2001) Omega-3 fatty acids, homocysteine, and the increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in major depressive disorder..

Depression is a potentially life-threatening disease. It is a major risk factor for suicide as well as coronary artery disease (CAD) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). It also may be associated with impaired endothelial dysfunction and decreased heart rate variability (HRV). Both conditions seem to persist in patients with depression despite successful antidepressant treatment. During the last few years epidemiological studies as well as clinical trials have suggested a significant role of omega-3 fatty acids in the pathogenesis of depression. As omega-3 fatty acids have been demonstrated to also beneficially influence many of the conditions depression is a risk factor for (CAD, SCD) or may be associated with (decreased HRV, endothelial dysfunction), they may well represent a major advance in the treatment of depression.

METHODS: A total of 180 participants were recruited from Sina Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, who were diagnosed with depression based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revision and Beck Depression Inventory. Participants (n = 180) were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to Groups A, B, and C. The last two were provided with an instruction to consume Caspian white fish marinated in the presence or absence of EOPF (434 g each week or four meals per week). Group A served as the control with the common diet. The outcome measures were performed using the Beck Depression Inventory and the General Health Questionnaire. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in depressive symptom scores between groups with frequent fish consumption as compared with the control (p > 0.05). Yet adjustment for covariates showed that there was a significant reduction in depression among them (p < 0.05). Moreover, consumption of fish and EOPF was associated with more considerable improvements than Groups A and B (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It could be concluded that high intakes of unsaturated fatty acids can afford to diminish likelihood of late-life depression.

HCV has neurotrophic properties and affects lipid metabolism, essential for cognitive function. We evaluated the relationship of lipid profiles with depression and anxiety symptoms and the effects of 12-weeks of therapy with fluvastatin and omega-3 ethyl esters (n-3 PUFA) in a randomised pilot study of CHC prior non-responders. Participants (n = 60) had fasting lipid profiles and assessment of depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire at each study visit. At screening 26/60 (43 %) had HADS-A score ≥8 and 13/60 (22 %) had HADS-D scores ≥8. Depressed patients had significantly lower apolipoprotein-E concentrations (30 mg/l vs 39 mg/l, P = 0.029) than those without depression and a tendency toward lower total cholesterol (3.8 vs 4.4 mmol/l, P = 0.053). 3 patients discontinued lipid-modifying treatment because of worsening depression. However, there was a small but significant improvement in anxiety symptoms after 12-weeks of high-dose (2-4 g daily) n-3 PUFA. In conclusion, depression in CHC is associated with plasma apoE deficiency. We postulate that apoE deficiency disrupts blood brain barrier integrity to promote HCV infection of the CNS. High-dose n-PUFAs may alleviate anxiety in some CHC patients but the use of lipid lowering therapy must be balanced against risks of worsening depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sheridan DA ; Bridge SH ; Crossey MM ; Felmlee DJ ; Thomas HC ; Neely RD ; Taylor-Robinson SD ; Bassendine MF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11011-014-9520-9 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnxiety/blood/drug therapy/psychology\r\nApolipoproteins E/*blood\r\nCholesterol/blood\r\nDepression/*blood/drug therapy/*psychology\r\nFatty Acids, Monounsaturated/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nFluvastatin\r\nHepatitis C, Chronic/*blood/complications/*psychology\r\nHumans\r\nHydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/therapeutic use\r\nIndoles/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPilot Projects\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sheridan DA, Bridge SH, Crossey MM, Felmlee DJ, Thomas HC, Neely RD, Taylor-Robinson SD, and Bassendine MF (2014) Depressive symptoms in chronic hepatitis C are associated with plasma apolipoprotein E deficiency..

We pretreated animals with fish oil and induced acute depression-like behaviors with systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. The levels of cytokines and stress hormones were determined from plasma and different brain areas. The results showed that fish oil treatment prevent LPS-induce depressive behavior by suppression of neuroinflammation. LPS induced acute neuroinflammation in different brain regions, which were prevented in fish oil fed mice. However, neither LPS administration nor fish oil treatment has strong effect on stress hormone secretion in the hypothalamus and adrenal. Fish oil might provide a useful therapy against inflammation-associated depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shi Z ; Ren H ; Huang Z ; Peng Y ; He B ; Yao X ; Yuan TF ; Su H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s12035-016-0212-9 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nDepression/*chemically induced/pathology/*prevention & control\r\nFish Oils/*administration & dosage\r\nInflammation/chemically induced/pathology/prevention & control\r\nLipopolysaccharides/*toxicity\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nOxidative Stress/*drug effects/physiology\r\nDepression\r\nFish oil\r\nHPA axis\r\nLPS\r\nNeuroinflammation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shi Z, Ren H, Huang Z, Peng Y, He B, Yao X, Yuan TF, and Su H (2017) Fish Oil Prevents Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Depressive-Like Behavior by Inhibiting Neuroinflammation..

Fifty patients were treated for 28 days with 1200 mg LOE per day. Positive effects of LOE on psycho-emotional status and arterial blood pressure in patients with stage 1 hypertension were observed 1 week earlier than in patients with stage 2 hypertension. According to the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, a significant improvement in the symptoms of anxiety and depression was observed in 32% of patients, a moderate improvement in 48% and a weak effect in 8%; 12% of patients did not respond to therapy.

Depression is common in multiple sclerosis (MS) affecting between 50–60% of patients. Pilot studies in unipolar depression report an improvement in depression when omega-3 fatty acids are given with antidepressants. The objective of this study was to investigate whether omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, as an augmentation therapy, improves treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) in people with MS. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of omega-3 fatty acids at six grams per day over three months. The primary outcome was a 50% or greater improvement on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Thirty-nine participants were randomized and thirty-one completed the 3-month intervention. Improvement on MADRS between groups was not significantly different at the 3-month end point with 47.4% in the omega-3 fatty acid group and 45.5% in the placebo group showing 50% or greater improvement (p = 0.30). Omega-3 fatty acids as an augmentation therapy for treatment-resistant depression in MS was not significantly different than placebo in this pilot trial. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation at the dose given was well-tolerated over 3 months.

Not only in physical valuation but also in managing psychiatric disorders, omega-3 fatty acids have been found to be a powerful formula. It is proclaimed that depressive patients suffer anomaly with the levels of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the body, coupled with insignificant EPA and DHA. Enhancement in brain functioning, neuronal functions, and paying attention in interacting with the brain cells are some of the additional tasks, being performed by the supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids. The leading and primary source via dietary supplementation involves the involvement of fish and fish products. These are hypothesized to be the best and dominant source for omega-3 fatty acids. Consumption of omega-3 fatty acid is well safe, that physician highly favors intake of these supplements, remarkably in the case of pregnant women. However, treating this serious life-threatening mental disorder leads to many adverse effects when treated with antidepressants. The dose range includes 1g/d to 10g/d, which is to be incorporated by the patient. It is also tested that the combination of EPA and DHA is found to be more efficacious for a person in treating and preventing depressive symptoms. Some studies verify the supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids in diet was coequally productive and successful with minimal side effects when analyzed with antidepressants. Despite these facts, much research is still needed and presently in process for long-term safety and studying the role of omega-3 fatty acids in human health.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sikka P ; Behl T ; Sharma S ; Sehgal A ; Bhatia S ; Al-Harrasi A ; Singh S ; Sharma N ; Aleya L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11356-021-14884-5 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents\r\nBrain\r\n*Depression/drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nPregnancy\r\nAntidepressants\r\nDocosahexaenoic acid\r\nEicosapentaenoic acid\r\nOmega-3 fatty acids\r\nSupplementation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sikka P, Behl T, Sharma S, Sehgal A, Bhatia S, Al-Harrasi A, Singh S, Sharma N, and Aleya L (2021) Exploring the therapeutic potential of omega-3 fatty acids in depression..

However, even after several meta-analyses, no translation of evidence into clinical practice has taken place. We performed a systematic review to evaluate meta-analytic evidence of randomized controlled trials on the use of anti-inflammatory agents for MDD to summarize efficacy estimates and elucidate shortcomings. METHODS: Pooled effect estimates and heterogeneity indices were primary outcomes. Characteristics of the included meta-analyses were extracted. Scientific quality of meta-analyses was assessed using the Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (R-AMSTAR). RESULTS: N=20 meta-analyses met the eligibility criteria. Study characteristics like outcome scales, composition of patient populations, and add-on or monotherapy regimen varied very little for celecoxib studies, varied little for minocycline studies, and were rather variable for omega 3 fatty acids studies. R-AMSTAR scores ranged from 26 to 39 out of 44 points indicating variable quality, where a comprehensive literature search was the strongest and the consideration of scientific quality in the conclusions was the weakest domain across all meta-analyses. For minocycline and celecoxib, superiority was demonstrated with medium to large effect size with substantial heterogeneity and with large to very large effect size with negligible heterogeneity, respectively. For omega 3 fatty acids, superiority was also demonstrated with mainly small and medium effect sizes with substantial heterogeneity. However, for minocycline and omega 3 fatty acids, non-significant meta-analyses were found also. CONCLUSION: Even in our synthesized approach, no clear recommendations could be derived on the use of anti-inflammatory treatment for MDD due to several critical aspects like heterogeneity, diversity of patient populations, treatment regimen, and outcomes, and limited scientific quality. However, we observed clear inter-substance differences with meta-analytic evidence being strongest for celecoxib and weakest for omega 3 fatty acids.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Simon MS ; Arteaga-Henríquez G ; Fouad Algendy A; Siepmann T ; Illigens BMW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2147/NDT.S385117 ","Keywords":"anti-inflammatory therapy\r\ninflammation\r\nmajor depressive disorder\r\nmethodological shortcomings\r\nstate of knowledge","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Simon MS, Arteaga-Henríquez G, Fouad Algendy A, Siepmann T, and Illigens BMW (2023) Anti-Inflammatory Treatment Efficacy in Major Depressive Disorder: A Systematic Review of Meta-Analyses..

Consumption of n-3 PUFA may alleviate both cognitive decline and depression. The aim of the present study was to investigate the benefits of supplementing a diet with n-3 PUFA, DHA and EPA, for depressive symptoms, quality of life (QOL) and cognition in elderly people with MCI. We conducted a 6-month double-blind, randomised controlled trial. A total of fifty people aged >65 years with MCI were allocated to receive a supplement rich in EPA (1·67 g EPA + 0·16 g DHA/d; n 17), DHA (1·55 g DHA + 0·40 g EPA/d; n 18) or the n-6 PUFA linoleic acid (LA; 2·2 g/d; n 15). Treatment allocation was by minimisation based on age, sex and depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS). Physiological and cognitive assessments, questionnaires and fatty acid composition of erythrocytes were obtained at baseline and 6 months (completers: n 40; EPA n 13, DHA n 16, LA n 11). Compared with the LA group, GDS scores improved in the EPA (P=0·04) and DHA (P=0·01) groups and verbal fluency (Initial Letter Fluency) in the DHA group (P=0·04). Improved GDS scores were correlated with increased DHA plus EPA (r 0·39, P=0·02). Improved self-reported physical health was associated with increased DHA. There were no treatment effects on other cognitive or QOL parameters. Increased intakes of DHA and EPA benefited mental health in older people with MCI. Increasing n-3 PUFA intakes may reduce depressive symptoms and the risk of progressing to dementia. This needs to be investigated in larger, depressed samples with MCI.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sinn N ; Milte CM ; Street SJ ; Buckley JD ; Coates AM ; Petkov J ; Howe PR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S0007114511004788 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAustralia\r\nCognition Disorders/blood/*diet therapy/physiopathology/psychology\r\nDepression/blood/*diet therapy/physiopathology/psychology\r\nDietary Supplements/analysis\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/analysis/metabolism/therapeutic use\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/analysis/metabolism/therapeutic use\r\nErythrocytes/metabolism\r\n*Executive Function\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/analysis/metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nFish Oils/chemistry/metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMemory Disorders/etiology/*prevention & control\r\nPatient Dropouts\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\n*Quality of Life\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSpeech Disorders/etiology/prevention & control","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sinn N, Milte CM, Street SJ, Buckley JD, Coates AM, Petkov J, and Howe PR (2012) Effects of n-3 fatty acids, EPA v.

METHODS: A naturalistic 8-week open-label pilot trial of low-dose DHA, (260 mg or 520 mg/day) in 28 patients with MDD who were non-responsive to medication or psychotherapy, with a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score of greater than 17, was conducted. Primary outcomes of depression, clinical severity, and daytime sleepiness were measured. RESULTS: After 8 weeks, 54% of patients had a ≥50% reduction on the HAM-D, and 45% were in remission (HAM-D ≤ 7). The eta-squared statistic (0.59) indicated a large effect size for the reduction of depression (equivalent to Cohen's d of 2.4). However confidence in this effect size is tempered due to the lack of a placebo. The mean score for the Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale was significantly improved by 1.28 points (P < 0.05). Despite a significant reduction in the HAM-D score for middle insomnia (P = 0.02), the reduction in excessive daytime somnolence on the total Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) did not reach significance. No significant adverse reactions to DHA were found. CONCLUSION: Within the major limits of this open-label pilot study, the results suggest that DHA may provide additional adjunctive benefits in patients with mild- to -moderate depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Smith DJ ; Sarris J ; Dowling N ; O'Connor M ; Ng CH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/1028415X.2017.1283128 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nCombined Modality Therapy/adverse effects\r\nDepression/diet therapy/drug therapy/physiopathology/therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*diet therapy/drug therapy/physiopathology/therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*diet therapy/drug \r\n      therapy/physiopathology/therapy\r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\r\n*Dietary Supplements/adverse effects\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMood Disorders/chemically induced/etiology/prevention & control\r\nPilot Projects\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\n*Psychotherapy\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSleep Disorders, Intrinsic/etiology/prevention & control\r\nAdjunctive\r\nDHA\r\nDepression\r\nDocosahexaenoic acid\r\nOmega-3","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Smith DJ, Sarris J, Dowling N, O'Connor M, and Ng CH (2018) Adjunctive low-dose docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for major depression: An open-label pilot trial..

To examine the association between cholesterol and mental health, the authors performed an observational study. METHOD: From April 1995 to March 2002, a series of questionnaires pertaining to physical activity, food consumption, alcohol, coffee, smoking, and mental health (12 item-version of General Health Questionnaire: GHQ-12) were administered to 1972 employees in Japan. Subjects with less than 150 mg/dL of total cholesterol (very low cholesterol cohort) and other subjects (control cohort) were followed up for one to six years, and their mental health compared using GHQ caseness (GHQ-12 scores more than 3). RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that the very low cholesterol cohort had significantly greater GHQ caseness than the control cohort. Notably, this finding applied to males but not to females. After adjustment for general health, Cox's proportional hazards regression model confirmed this association in males only. The survival curves of control cohort were significantly different between males and females whereas those of very low cholesterol cohort were not. LIMITATIONS: GHQ caseness was regarded as \"death\" in the survival analysis. As such, it is not possible to differentiate between transient and persistent mental dysfunction and therefore may lead to overestimation of GHQ caseness over observational years. CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that very low cholesterol may be associated with worse mental health in males and conversely and interestingly indicate that moderate (but not very low) cholesterol levels may protect mental health in males.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Soeda S ; Terao T ; Iwata N ; Abe H ; Uchida K ; Nakamura J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2005.10.012 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAlcohol Drinking\r\nBody Mass Index\r\nCholesterol/blood\r\nCohort Studies\r\nDepression/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology\r\nEnergy Intake\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nHypercholesterolemia/*epidemiology\r\nMale\r\nMotor Activity\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSmoking/epidemiology\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Soeda S, Terao T, Iwata N, Abe H, Uchida K, and Nakamura J (2006) Mental effect of cholesterol in males: protective effect?.

However, the interrelationship between inflammation and NTFs is unknown. Recently, ethyl-eicosapentaenoate (EPA) has been used to treat depression. The mechanism by which EPA benefits depression is also unclear. Using the olfactory bulbectomized (OB) rat model of depression, this study evaluated two pathways from bulbectomy to the induction of depression-like changes (the inflammation-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis-stress response pathway and inflammation-nerve growth factor-memory pathway) and the effect of EPA on these pathways. When compared with sham-operated rats fed a control diet, significantly increased locomotor and rearing activities in an \"open field,\" impaired memory in the Morris water maze, increased expression of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), and increased secretion of corticosterone were found in OB rats. mRNA expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) was significantly lower in the hippocampus, and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) was higher in the hypothalamus; this change was associated with increased interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the serum and brain. EPA treatments normalized these behavioral impairments and reduced CRF expression and corticosterone secretion. EPA also reduced serum concentrations of IL-1beta and PGE2, but reversed NGF reduction. Similar to the effects of EPA, the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib significantly reduced blood PGE2, IL-1beta, and corticosterone concentrations and increased NGF expression in OB rats. Furthermore, anti-NGF treatment blocked EPA effects on behavior. These results suggest that an interaction exists between inflammation and NGF in the depression model. EPA may improve depression via its anti-inflammation properties and the upregulation of NGF.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Song C ; Zhang XY ; Manku M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3569-08.2009 ","Keywords":"Analysis of Variance\r\nAnimals\r\nCelecoxib\r\nCorticosterone/blood\r\nCorticotropin-Releasing Hormone/blood\r\nCyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/pathology\r\nDinoprostone/blood\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use\r\nEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\r\nExploratory Behavior/drug effects/physiology\r\nGene Expression Regulation/*drug effects\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nInterleukin-1/blood\r\nMale\r\nMaze Learning/drug effects/physiology\r\nNerve Growth Factor/genetics/*metabolism\r\nOlfactory Bulb/surgery\r\nPhospholipases A2/genetics/*metabolism\r\nPlatelet Aggregation Inhibitors/*therapeutic use\r\nPyrazoles/pharmacology\r\nRNA, Messenger/metabolism\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSulfonamides/pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Song C, Zhang XY, and Manku M (2009) Increased phospholipase A2 activity and inflammatory response but decreased nerve growth factor expression in the olfactory bulbectomized rat model of depression: effects of chronic ethyl-eicosapentaenoate treatment..

The evidence consequently suggests that drugs or natural products with anti-inflammatory properties should be developed to treat the illness. Among several candidates that modulate the neuro-immune network, omega-(n)-3 essential unsaturated fatty acids have emerged as effective treatments for affective disorders. Because these fatty acids can influence membrane structure, reduce inflammation and regulate protein and gene expressions, their effects seem promising. In this chapter, the newest findings that support the inflammatory theory of affective disorders have been first selected and reviewed. Secondly, the role of n-3 fatty acids in the immune system and brain has been introduced and then the possible mechanisms by which n-3 fatty acids attenuated symptoms of depression are discussed by the insight of the results from the animal studies. Finally, the clinical effects of n-3 fatty acids on major, bipolar and postpartum depression are summarized. Furthermore, the chapter points out the limitations and future research in this area.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Song C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000343970 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nBrain/physiopathology\r\nFatty Acids, Nonesterified/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMood Disorders/*drug therapy/psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Song C (2013) Essential fatty acids as potential anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of affective disorders..

However, the exact role of each fatty acid in neuroimmune modulation and neurogenesis, the interaction between EPA and DHA, and the best EPA:DHA ratios for improving brain disorders, remain unclear. It is also unknown whether EPA, as a DHA precursor, acts directly or via DHA. Here, we discuss recent evidence of EPA and DHA effects in the treatment of major depression and Alzheimer's disease, as well as their potential synergistic action on anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neurotrophic processes in the brain. We further analyze the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which EPA, DHA or their combination may benefit these diseases. We also outline the limitations of current studies and suggest new genetic models and novel approaches to overcome these limitations.

The onset of perinatal depression is associated with changes in reproductive hormones, stress hormones and neurosteroids. These chemical compounds can be modulated by the gut microbiota, which may affect maternal mental health during the perinatal period via the gut-brain-axis. Recent studies suggest that nutritional and dietary interventions (vitamin D, ω-3 fatty acids, iron, and fiber) effectively prevent or mitigate maternal depression and anxiety, but their efficacy is confounded by various factors, including the gut microbiota. Probiotics are efficacious in maintaining microbiota homeostasis, and thus, have the potential to modulate the development of perinatal mood disorders, despite no evidence in human. Therefore, clinical trials are warranted to investigate the role of probiotic supplementation in perinatal depression and behavioral changes. This article reviews the interplay between nutrition, gut microbiota and mood and cognition, and the evidence suggesting that probiotics affect the onset and development of perinatal depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Song J ; Zhou B ; Kan J ; Liu G ; Zhang S ; Si L ; Zhang X ; Yang X ; Ma J ; Cheng J ; Yang Y ; Liu X ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fcimb.2022.932309 ","Keywords":"Anxiety\r\nDepression\r\nFemale\r\n*Gastrointestinal Microbiome\r\nHormones\r\nHumans\r\nPregnancy\r\n*Probiotics/therapeutic use\r\nfiber\r\nmicrobiota\r\nnutrition\r\nperinatal depression\r\nprobiotics","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Song J, Zhou B, Kan J, Liu G, Zhang S, Si L, Zhang X, Yang X, Ma J, Cheng J, Yang Y, and Liu X (2022) Gut microbiota: Linking nutrition and perinatal depression..

The purpose of this review was to evaluate the evidence to date within the context of the study design and methodology used. In case-control and cohort studies, concentrations of omega-3 PUFAs were lower in participants with unipolar and postpartum depression. Fish are the major dietary source of omega-3 PUFAs, and infrequent fish consumption is associated with depression in epidemiological studies. While these findings do not appear to be the result of confounding, in some studies failure to detect confounding may be due to a lack of power or incomplete control. In four of seven double-blind randomized controlled trials, depression was significantly improved upon treatment with at least 1 g/day of eicosapentaenoic acid, an omega-3 PUFA. While clinical significance was demonstrated, preservation of blinding may be a limitation in this area of research. It remains unclear whether omega-3 supplementation is effective independently of antidepressant treatment, for depressed patients in general or only those with abnormally low concentrations of these PUFAs. The relationship between omega-3 PUFAs and depression is biologically plausible and is consistent across study designs, study groups, and diverse populations, which increases the likelihood of a causal relationship.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sontrop J ; Campbell MK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ypmed.2005.11.005 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nConfounding Factors, Epidemiologic\r\nDepression, Postpartum/drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDiet\r\nEpidemiologic Studies\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nResearch Design","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sontrop J, and Campbell MK (2006) Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and depression: a review of the evidence and a methodological critique..

METHODS: Participants with gestational age between 22 and 24 weeks were randomized in placebo (olive oil; n = 30) or omega-3 (fish oil; n = 30) groups and supplemented until childbirth. Fish oil capsules provided 1440 mg/day of docosahexaenoic acid. Depressive symptoms were evaluated during the gestational period: (G1) 22-24 weeks; (G2) 26-28 weeks; (G3) 30-32 weeks; (G4) 34-36 weeks; and postpartum: (P1) second week; (P2) first month; (P3) fourth month; and (P4) sixth month, using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). RESULTS: Comparison between groups showed no differences in the EPDS score at any time during pregnancy or postpartum, in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis (p > 0.05). Both groups presented a reduction in the EPDS score over time. According to intention-to-treat analysis, when comparing to the baseline, the placebo group showed a reduction in the EPDS score at P1 and P4, while the omega-3 group showed a reduction at all times from G4 to P4. In per-protocol analysis, the placebo group showed a reduction in the EPDS score at P3, while the omega-3 group showed a reduction at all times from G2 to P4. CONCLUSIONS: The supplementation with omega-3 did not promote significant differences between groups. However, an earlier reduction in the EPDS score was observed in the omega-3 group, which may indicate a benefit of antenatal omega-3 supplementation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sousa TM ; Santos LCD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/1028415X.2022.2068877 ","Keywords":"Female\r\nPregnancy\r\nHumans\r\nDepression/drug therapy/prevention & control\r\nPostpartum Period\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\n*Depression, Postpartum/prevention & control/drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nOmega-3\r\ndepressive symptoms\r\nmaternal nutrition\r\npostpartum period\r\npregnancy\r\nrandomized controlled trial","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sousa TM, and Santos LCD (2023) Effect of antenatal omega-3 supplementation on maternal depressive symptoms from pregnancy to 6 months postpartum: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial..

Such a link has been hypothesized given that certain nutrients are important in the neurotransmission system and pregnancy depletes essential nutrients. PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL databases were searched for relevant articles until 30 May 2015. We included peer-reviewed studies of any design that evaluated whether perinatal depression is related to dietary intake, which was defined as adherence to certain diets, food-derived intake of essential nutrients or supplements. We identified 4808 studies, of which 35 fulfilled inclusion criteria: six randomized controlled trials, 12 cohort, one case-control and 16 cross-sectional studies, representing 88 051 distinct subjects. Studies were grouped into four main categories based on the analysis of dietary intake: adherence to dietary patterns (nine studies); full panel of essential nutrients (six studies); specific nutrients (including B vitamins, Vitamin D, calcium and zinc; eight studies); and intake of fish or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs; 12 studies). While 13 studies, including three PUFA supplementation trials, found no evidence of an association, 22 studies showed protective effects from healthy dietary patterns, multivitamin supplementation, fish and PUFA intake, calcium, Vitamin D, zinc and possibly selenium. Given the methodological limitations of existing studies and inconsistencies in findings across studies, the evidence on whether nutritional factors influence the risk of perinatal depression is still inconclusive.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Medline, PreMedline, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL were searched to November 2011 without restriction to publication status. REVIEW METHODS: Randomised trials comparing any psychological, pharmacological, nutritional, or combined intervention with usual services or another treatment. Studies of participants with a formal diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were excluded. Studies were assessed for bias, and relevant limitations were considered in summarising the results. RESULTS: 11 trials including 1246 participants and eight comparisons were included. Median sample size of included trials was 81 (range 51-288). Meta-analyses were performed for transition to psychosis, symptoms of psychosis, depression, and mania; quality of life; weight; and discontinuation of treatment. Evidence of moderate quality showed an effect for cognitive behavioural therapy on reducing transition to psychosis at 12 months (risk ratio 0.54 (95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.86); risk difference -0.07 (-0.14 to -0.01). Very low quality evidence for omega-3 fatty acids and low to very low quality evidence for integrated psychotherapy also indicated that these interventions were associated with reductions in transition to psychosis at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Although evidence of benefits for any specific intervention is not conclusive, these findings suggest that it might be possible to delay or prevent transition to psychosis. Further research should be undertaken to establish conclusively the potential for benefit of psychological interventions in the treatment of people at high risk of psychosis.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Stafford MR ; Jackson H ; Mayo-Wilson E ; Morrison AP ; Kendall T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1136/bmj.f185 ","Keywords":"Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nEarly Diagnosis\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nPsychotic Disorders/diagnosis/*prevention & control/psychology/therapy\r\nRisk Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Stafford MR, Jackson H, Mayo-Wilson E, Morrison AP, and Kendall T (2013) Early interventions to prevent psychosis: systematic review and meta-analysis..

In the past ten years, there have been 12 intervention studies conducted using various preparations of longchain omega-3 PUFA in unipolar and bipolar depression. The majority of these studies administered long-chain omega-3 PUFA as an adjunct therapy. The studies have been conducted over 4 to 16 weeks of intervention and have often included small cohorts. In four out of the seven studies conducted in depressed individuals and in two out of the five studies in bipolar patients, individuals have reported a positive outcome following supplementation with ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid or fish oil containing long-chain omega-3 PUFA. In the three trials that researched the influence of DHA-rich preparations, no significant effects were reported. The mechanisms that have been invoked to account for the benefits of long-chain omega-3 PUFA in depression include reductions in prostaglandins derived from arachidonic acid, which lead to decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels and/or alterations in blood flow to the brain.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Stahl LA ; Begg DP ; Weisinger RS ; Sinclair AJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nBrain/metabolism\r\nDepression/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*physiology/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMood Disorders/*drug therapy/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Stahl LA, Begg DP, Weisinger RS, and Sinclair AJ (2008) The role of omega-3 fatty acids in mood disorders..

Escitalopram (ESC) is one of only two antidepressants approved as treatment for juvenile depression. Still, delayed onset of action, and immediate plus the risk of lasting side effects contribute to low patient adherence, and places the medical prescriber in a difficult situation weighing the potential long-term effects of juvenile treatment against the known consequences of untreated MDD. Research into alternative or augmentation strategies and their long-term effects are needed to improve clinical outcome and better our understanding of the long-term consequences of early-life treatment. We investigated the early-life (postnatal day 35 (PND35)) and lasting (PND60) bio-behavioural effects of pre-pubertal (PND21 to PND34) escitalopram (ESC) administration and/or ω-3 supplementation (OM3) in stress sensitive Flinders Sensitive Line rats. Only ESC treatment showed a strong trend to decrease depressive-like behaviour via significantly increased climbing behaviour on PND35. However, OM3 treatment reduced locomotor activity and increased hippocampal neuroplasticity on PND35, suggesting improved coping behaviour and masking of possible antidepressant-like effects. Reduced locomotor activity lasted into early-adulthood on PND60, despite a treatment-free period from PND35 to PND60. Regardless, early-adulthood antidepressive-like behaviour was only observed in the combination treatment (ESC + OM3) group, despite a significant increase in serotonin turnover, suggesting strong neurodevelopmental process to be involved. Taken together, the combination of ESC and OM3 might induce lasting beneficial neurodevelopmental effects in a stress-sensitive population, suggesting a possible role in current treatment strategies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Steyn SF ; Harvey BH ; Brink CB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2018.05.021 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nCitalopram/*pharmacology\r\nDepressive Disorder/*therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage\r\nMale\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nRats\r\nSexual Maturation\r\nStress, Psychological/therapy\r\nAugmentation\r\nEscitalopram\r\nFlinders Sensitive Line rats\r\nLasting effects\r\nOmega-3\r\nPre-pubertal treatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Steyn SF, Harvey BH, and Brink CB (2018) Immediate and long-term antidepressive-like effects of pre-pubertal escitalopram and omega-3 supplementation combination in young adult stress-sensitive rats..

Depression has been reported to be associated with the abnormality of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). A profound decrease of omega-3 PUFAs in the mother during pregnancy is associated with the higher demand of fetal development and might precipitate the occurrence of depression. In this study, we examined the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA monotherapy for the treatment of depression during pregnancy. METHOD: From June 2004 to June 2006, we conducted an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing omega-3 PUFAs (3.4 g/d) with placebo in pregnant women with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV criteria). No psychotropic agent was given 1 month prior to or during the study period. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) was scored every other week as the primary measurement of efficacy, while the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were secondary measures. RESULTS: Thirty-six subjects were randomly assigned to either omega-3 PUFAs or placebo, and 33 among them were evaluated in more than 2 visits. A total of 24 subjects completed the study. As compared to the placebo group, subjects in the omega-3 group had significantly lower HAM-D scores at weeks 6 (p = .001) and 8 (p = .019), a significantly higher response rate (62% vs. 27%, p = .03), and a higher remission rate, although the latter did not reach statistical significance (38% vs. 18%, p = .28). At the study end point, subjects in the omega-3 group also had significantly lower depressive symptom ratings on the EPDS and BDI. The omega-3 PUFAs were well tolerated and there were no adverse effects on the subjects and newborns. CONCLUSIONS: Omega-3 PUFAs may have therapeutic benefits in depression during pregnancy. In regard to the safety issue and psychotherapeutic effect, as well as health promotion to mothers and their newborns, it is worthy to conduct replication studies in a larger sample with a broad regimen of omega-3 PUFAs in pregnant women with depression.

Based upon the evidence from epidemiological data, case-control studies of phospholipid polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) levels in human tissues, and antidepressant effect in clinical trials, PUFAs have shed a light to discover the unsolved of depression and connect the mind and body. Briefly, the deficit of n-3 PUFAs has been reported to be associated with neurological, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, autoimmune, metabolic diseases and cancers. Recent studies revealed that the deficit of n-3 PUFAs is also associated with depression. For example, societies that consume a small amount of omega-3 PUFAs appear to have a higher prevalence of major depressive disorder. In addition, depressive patients had showed a lower level of omega-3 PUFAs; and the antidepressant effect of PUFAs had been reported in a number of clinical trials. The PUFAs are classified into n-3 (or omega-3) and n-6 (or omega-6) groups. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the major bioactive components of n-3 PUFAs, are not synthesized in human body and can only be obtained directly from the diet, particularly by consuming fish. DHA deficit is associated with dysfunctions of neuronal membrane stability and transmission of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, which might connect to the aetiology of mood and cognitive dysfunction of depression. On the other hand, EPA is important in balancing the immune function and physical healthy by reducing arachidonic acid (AA, an n-6 PUFA) level on cell membrane and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis. Interestingly, animals fed with high AA diet or treated with PGE2 were observed to present sickness behaviours of anorexia, low activity, change in sleep pattern and attention, which are similar to somatic symptoms of depression in human. Therefore, the deficit of EPA and DHA in depression might be associated with mood disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, medical comorbidity and somatic symptoms in depression. Indeed, the role of n-3 PUFAs in immunity and mood function supports the promising psychoneuroimmunologic hypothesis of depression and provides an excellent interface shared by body and mind.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Su KP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy/*etiology\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*physiology/therapeutic use\r\nFish Oils\r\nHumans\r\nNutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nPhospholipids/chemistry/metabolism\r\n*Psychoneuroimmunology\r\n*Psychophysiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Su KP (2008) Mind-body interface: the role of n-3 fatty acids in psychoneuroimmunology, somatic presentation, and medical illness comorbidity of depression..

AREAS COVERED: A number of epidemiological and preclinical studies have proven the potential benefit and critical role of omega-3 PUFA in the development and management of major depressive disorder (MDD). In addition, recently independent clinical trials and meta-analyses have also provided superidority of omega-3 PUFA over placebo as monotherapy or augmentation agent in the treatment of MDD. This article presents a brief overview of the evidence to date about the clinical application and biological mechanisms of omega-3 PUFA in the treatment of MDD. EXPERT OPINION: Given the potential action mechanism, clinical benefits and currently available clinical trial data, omega-3 PUFAs may deserve greater attention and wider application for treatment of MDD. However, the practical utility of omega-3 PUFA as one of promising alternative agent for treatment of MDD still have many questions unresolved to be fully addressed in near future.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Su KP ; Wang SM ; Pae CU ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1517/13543784.2013.836487 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Su KP, Wang SM, and Pae CU (2013) Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for major depressive disorder..

The routine prophylaxis with antidepressants might expose patients to adverse effects, hence, the need for alternative preventive interventions. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are safe and effective essential nutritional compounds used for the treatment of depression, putatively through an anti-inflammatory action. In addition, lower erythrocyte levels of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been associated with an increased risk of IFN-induced depression. METHODS: We conducted a 2-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and placebo for the prevention of IFN-α-induced depression. A total of 162 patients consented to participate and were randomized to the study. All of the patients completed the 2-week trial; 152 participants were followed throughout the 24 weeks of IFN-α treatment and were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, the incident rates of IFN-α-induced depression were significantly lower in EPA-treated but not in DHA-treated patients (10% and 28%, respectively, versus 30% for placebo, p = .037). Both EPA and DHA significantly delayed the onset of IFN-induced depression (week of onset: 12.0 and 11.7, respectively, versus 5.3 for placebo, p = .002). EPA and DHA were both well tolerated in this population. EPA treatment increased both EPA and DHA erythrocyte levels, but DHA only increased DHA erythrocyte levels. CONCLUSIONS: EPA is effective in the prevention of depression in hepatitis C virus patients received IFN-α therapy. Our study confirms the notion that anti-inflammatory strategies are effective antidepressants in the context of depression associated with inflammation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Su KP ; Lai HC ; Yang HT ; Su WP ; Peng CY ; Chang JP ; Chang HC ; Pariante CM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.01.008 ","Keywords":"Depression/*chemically induced/*prevention & control\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/*therapeutic use\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHepatitis C/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nInterferon-alpha/*adverse effects\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nChronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)\r\nclinical trial\r\ninflammation\r\ninterferon-alpha (IFN-α)\r\nmajor depressive disorder (MDD)\r\nomega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Su KP, Lai HC, Yang HT, Su WP, Peng CY, Chang JP, Chang HC, and Pariante CM (2014) Omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention of interferon-alpha-induced depression: results from a randomized, controlled trial..

Clinically, depressed patients manifest higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers, while proinflammatory cytokines induce neuropsychiatric symptoms (sickness behaviour) as well as major depressive episodes. Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation dysregulation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of depression. Biological mechanisms that link inflammation to neuropsychiatric symptoms are vital in the understanding of the \"mind-body\" interface. IFN-α-induced depression is the most powerful support for the inflammation theory of depression. This clinical observation provides an excellent model for depression research. By comparing subjects with and without major depression induced by the cytokine treatment, statistical powers could be largely increased by reducing phenotypic variation (homogeneity in aetiological factors). In addition, the anti-inflammatory pathway has recently become an important topic in looking for new antidepressant therapies. For example, anti-inflammatory compounds, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs or n-3 PUFAs), have been found to be associated with the development and treatment for depression in human and animal models. Here I review recent epidemiological studies, cross-sectional and longitudinal case-controlled studies, interventional clinical trials, as well as basic animal and cellular studies to prove the linkage among omega-3 PUFAs, inflammation, and depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Su KP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.7603/s40681-015-0021-x ","Keywords":"Anti-depressant\r\nAnti-inflammatory\r\nDepression\r\nInflammation\r\nInterferon-α (IFN-α)\r\nOmega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Su KP (2015) Nutrition, psychoneuroimmunology and depression: the therapeutic implications of omega-3 fatty acids in interferon-α-induced depression..

Although eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) seems to be the active component of omega-3 PUFAs' antidepressant effects, the biological research about the difference of specific genetic regulations between EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the two main components of omega-3 PUFAs, is still lacking in human subjects. METHODS: We conducted a 12-week randomized-controlled trial comparing the effects of EPA and DHA on gene expressions of phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), serotonin transporter (5HTT), and Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH-2) in 27 MDD patients. In addition, the erythrocyte PUFA compositions and the candidate gene expressions were also compared between these 27 MDD patients and 22 healthy controls. RESULTS: EPA was associated with a significant decrease in HAM-D scores (CI: -13 to -21, p<0.001) and significant increases in erythrocyte levels of EPA (CI: +1.0% to +2.9%, p=0.001) and DHA (CI: +2.9% to +5.6%, p=0.007). DHA treatment was associated with a significant decrease in HAM-D scores (CI: -6 to -14, p<0.001) and a significant increase in DHA levels (CI: +0.2% to +2.3%, p=0.047), but not of EPA levels. The cPLA2 gene expression levels were significantly increased in patients received EPA (1.9 folds, p=0.038), but not DHA (1.08 folds, p=0.92). There was a tendency for both EPA and DHA groups to decrease COX-2 gene expressions. The gene expressions of COX-2, cPLA2, TPH-2 and 5-HTT did not differ between MDD cases and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: EPA differentiates from DHA in clinical antidepressant efficacy and in upregulating cPLA2 gene regulations, which supports the clinical observation showing the superiority of EPA's antidepressant effects.

Recent meta-analyses ascribe discrepancies to differential effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) versus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and to diagnostic heterogeneity. This meta-analysis tests the hypothesis that EPA is the effective component in PUFA treatment of major depressive episodes. DATA SOURCES: PubMed/MeSH was searched for studies published in English from 1960 through June 2010 using the terms fish oils (MeSH) AND (depressive disorder [MeSH] OR bipolar depression) AND randomized controlled trial (publication type). The search was supplemented by manual bibliography review and examination of relevant review articles. STUDY SELECTION: The search yielded 15 trials involving 916 participants. Studies were included if they had a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study design; if depressive episode was the primary complaint (with or without comorbid medical conditions); if omega-3 PUFA supplements were administered; and if appropriate outcome measures were used to assess depressed mood. DATA EXTRACTION: Extracted data included study design, sample sizes, doses and percentages of EPA and DHA, mean ages, baseline and endpoint depression ratings and standard deviations for PUFA and placebo groups, and P values. The clinical outcome of interest was the standardized mean difference in the change from baseline to endpoint scores on a depression rating scale in subjects taking PUFA supplements versus subjects taking placebo. DATA SYNTHESIS: In a mixed-effect model, percentage of EPA in the supplements was the fixed-effect predictor, dichotomized into 2 groups: EPA < 60% or EPA ≥ 60% of the total EPA + DHA. Secondary analyses explored the relevance of treatment duration, age, and EPA dose. RESULTS: Supplements with EPA ≥ 60% showed benefit on standardized mean depression scores (effect size = 0.532; 95% CI, 0.277-0.733; t = 4.195; P < .001) versus supplements with EPA < 60% (effect size = -0.026; 95% CI, -0.200 to 0.148; t = -0.316; P = .756), with negligible contribution of random effects or heteroscedasticity and with no effects of treatment duration or age. Supplements with EPA < 60% were ineffective. Exploratory analyses supported a nonlinear model, with improvement determined by the dose of EPA in excess of DHA, within the range of 200 to 2,200 mg/d of EPA. CONCLUSIONS: Supplements containing EPA ≥ 60% of total EPA + DHA, in a dose range of 200 to 2,200 mg/d of EPA in excess of DHA, were effective against primary depression. Translational studies are needed to determine the mechanisms of EPA's therapeutic benefit.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sublette ME ; Ellis SP ; Geant AL ; Mann JJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.10m06634 ","Keywords":"Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/therapeutic use\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nPlacebos\r\n*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/methods/trends\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sublette ME, Ellis SP, Geant AL, and Mann JJ (2011) Meta-analysis of the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in clinical trials in depression..

This study aimed to explore that NaB exerts beneficial effects on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression-like behaviors and its possible mechanisms. The behavioral tests including sucrose preference test (SPT), open field test (OFT), tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST) were to evaluate the antidepressant effects of NaB. Then changes of Nissl's body in the hippocampus, brain serotonin (5-HT) concentration, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tight junctions (TJs) proteins level were assessed to explore the antidepressant mechanisms. Our results showed that CUMS caused significant depression-like behaviors, neuropathological changes, and decreased brain 5-HT concentration, TJs protein levels and BDNF expression in the hippocampus. However, NaB treatment significantly ameliorated behavioral deficits of the CUMS-induced mice, increased 5-HT concentration, increased BDNF expression, and up-regulated Occludin and zonula occludens-1(ZO-1) protein levels in the hippocampus, which demonstrated that NaB could partially restore CUMS-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairments. Besides, the pathologic changes were alleviated. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that NaB significantly improved depression-like behaviors in CUMS-induced mice and its antidepressant actions might be related with, at least in part, the increasing brain 5-HT concentration and BDNF expression and restoring BBB impairments.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sun J ; Wang F ; Hong G ; Pang M ; Xu H ; Li H ; Tian F ; Fang R ; Yao Y ; Liu J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neulet.2016.03.003 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nBlood-Brain Barrier/metabolism\r\nButyric Acid/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/etiology/psychology\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nStress, Psychological/complications/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nTight Junction Proteins/metabolism\r\n5-HT\r\nAntidepressant\r\nBDNF\r\nBlood–brain barrier (BBB)\r\nChronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)\r\nSodium butyrate","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sun J, Wang F, Hong G, Pang M, Xu H, Li H, Tian F, Fang R, Yao Y, and Liu J (2016) Antidepressant-like effects of sodium butyrate and its possible mechanisms of action in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress..

We found that SCH pre-treatment could decrease the immobility time of forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). And the results of 16S rRNA demonstrated that SCH pre-administration attenuated the dysbiosis of gut microbiota of depressive mice, along with altered fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Furthermore, SCH reduced the levels of proinflammatory factors of depressive mice and the expression of TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in the hippocampus. Overall, our study indicated that SCH might recover the gut microbial disorder of depressive mice through suppressing the expression of TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sun Y ; Yan T ; Gong G ; Li Y ; Zhang J ; Wu B ; Bi K ; Jia Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107029 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBacteria/*metabolism\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nCyclooctanes/*pharmacology\r\nCytokines/metabolism\r\nDepression/chemically induced/*drug therapy/metabolism/microbiology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDysbiosis\r\nFatty Acids, Volatile/*metabolism\r\n*Gastrointestinal Microbiome\r\nHippocampus/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nHost-Pathogen Interactions\r\nInflammation Mediators/metabolism\r\nLignans/*pharmacology\r\nLipopolysaccharides\r\nMale\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nNF-kappa B/*metabolism\r\nPolycyclic Compounds/*pharmacology\r\nSignal Transduction\r\nToll-Like Receptor 4/*metabolism\r\nDepression\r\nGut microbiota\r\nInflammation\r\nLipopolysaccharide\r\nSchisandrin\r\nTLR4/NF-κB signaling","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sun Y, Yan T, Gong G, Li Y, Zhang J, Wu B, Bi K, and Jia Y (2020) Antidepressant-like effects of Schisandrin on lipopolysaccharide-induced mice : Gut microbiota, short chain fatty acid and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway..

Given the heterogeneity of MDD, this approach may have obscured inter-patient differences and hampered the development of novel and targeted treatment strategies. An alternative strategy is ​​to use biomarkers to delineate endophenotypes of depression and test if these can be targeted via mechanism-based interventions. Several lines of evidence suggest that \"inflammatory depression\" is a clinically meaningful subtype of depression. Preliminary data indicate that omega-3 fatty acids, with their anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, may be efficacious in this subtype of depression, and this study aims to test this hypothesis. METHOD: We conduct a match-mismatch-trial to test if add-on omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) reduces depressive symptoms in patients with MDD and systemic low-grade inflammation. MDD patients on a stable antidepressant treatment are stratified at baseline on high sensitivity-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels to a high-inflammation group (hs-CRP ≥ 3 mg/L) or a low-inflammation group (hs-CRP < 3 mg/L). Both groups receive add-on EPA (2 g per day) for 8 weeks with three study visits, all including blood draws. Patients and raters are blind to inflammation status. Primary outcome measure is change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score between baseline and week 8. We hypothesize that the inflammation group has a superior antidepressant response to EPA compared to the non-inflammation group. Secondary outcomes include a composite score of \"inflammatory depressive symptoms\", quality of life, anxiety, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive performance and change in biomarkers relating to inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolomics and cellular aging. DISCUSSION: In this study we will, for the first time using a match-mismatch trial design, test if omega-3 is an efficacious treatment for inflammatory depression. If our study is successful, it could add to the field of precision psychiatry.

Alternative adjunct treatments, including nutritional therapies, may have the potential to alleviate residual symptoms and improve the outcomes of standard pharmacotherapy. The aim of this paper is to critically review the current clinical evidence and mechanisms of action of nutrient-based therapies alone or in combination with commonly used pharmacotherapies for mania and bipolar depression. METHODS: We conducted a Medline search for clinical trials conducted with humans, published in English from 1960 to 2012 using nutritional supplements such as n-3, chromium, inositol, choline, magnesium, folate and tryptophan alone or in combination with pharmacotherapies for the treatment of bipolar disorder. RESULTS: Preliminary data yields conflicting but mainly positive evidence for the use of n-3 fatty acids and chromium in the treatment of bipolar depression. Limited evidence found that inositol may be helpful for bipolar depression, but larger sample sizes are needed. Preliminary randomized, controlled trials suggest that choline, magnesium, folate and tryptophan may be beneficial for reducing symptoms of mania. CONCLUSIONS: Given the potential public health impact of identifying adjunct treatments that improve psychiatric as well as physical health outcomes, nutritional treatments appear promising for the management of bipolar disorder but require further study.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sylvia LG ; Peters AT ; Deckersbach T ; Nierenberg AA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000341309 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nCholine/therapeutic use\r\nChromium/therapeutic use\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFolic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nInositol/therapeutic use\r\nLipotropic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nMagnesium/therapeutic use\r\nTrace Elements/therapeutic use\r\nTryptophan/therapeutic use\r\nVitamin B Complex/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sylvia LG, Peters AT, Deckersbach T, and Nierenberg AA (2013) Nutrient-based therapies for bipolar disorder: a systematic review..

Hence, the current study investigated the effects of saffron supplementation on dietary intake, anthropometric measures, mood, sleep quality and metabolic biomarkers in overweight/obese patients with T2D. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 70 overweight/obese patients with T2D were randomly allocated to two groups and received 100 mg/day saffron or placebo for 8 weeks. Participants completed the Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II), Hurlbert index of sexual desire (HISD), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Diabetes-specific Quality-of-Life Brief Clinical Inventory questionnaires (DQOL-BCI). Dietary intake, anthropometric measures, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), haemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), insulin, lipid profile and liver enzymes were determined at baseline and the end of the study. RESULTS: At the end of the eighth week, saffron supplementation significantly decreased FPG, triglyceride (TG), insulin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (P < .001). Moreover, significant improvements in BDI-II scores and total quality of life were observed in the intervention group (P < .001). The saffron group showed more significant improvements in PSQI scores than the placebo group, such that at the post-intervention analysis, only the saffron group achieved a \"good\" sleep band. At this relatively high dose, saffron supplementation improved glycaemic status, lipid profile and liver enzyme measures in patients with T2D while also improving sleep and overall quality of life. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that saffron notably reduced hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia and improved liver function in patients with T2D in an 8-week randomised clinical trial.

Several studies have shown that an association exists between ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) and depression. However, this association has not been clear enough in the elderly with mild to moderate depression. Sixty-six inhabitants of Kahrizak Charity Foundation participated in this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Each participant was ≥ 65 years of age, had a Mini Mental State Exam of ≥ 22, and had scores ranging from 5 to 11 on the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15). During the 6 months, the drug group was treated daily with one gram of fish oil capsule containing 300 mg of both eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. No significant differences were noted between the groups in regard to level of education, use of antidepressant drugs, alcohol, tobacco use, history of chronic diseases, age, body mass index (BMI), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total cholesterol, and GDS-15 scores at baseline. After adjusting for cholesterol, BMI, and history of thyroid dysfunctions, a statistically significant difference was seen in GDS-15 scores between both groups. Furthermore, treatment with ω-3 PUFAs was clinically more effective in treating depression in comparison with the placebo. In this study, low-dose ω-3 PUFAs had some efficacy in the treatment of mild to moderate depression in elderly participants.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tajalizadekhoob Y ; Sharifi F ; Fakhrzadeh H ; Mirarefin M ; Ghaderpanahi M ; Badamchizade Z ; Azimipour S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00406-011-0191-9 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDiet\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Hypersensitivity\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nFish Oils/administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nNeuropsychological Tests\r\nSample Size\r\nSocioeconomic Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tajalizadekhoob Y, Sharifi F, Fakhrzadeh H, Mirarefin M, Ghaderpanahi M, Badamchizade Z, and Azimipour S (2011) The effect of low-dose omega 3 fatty acids on the treatment of mild to moderate depression in the elderly: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study..

The present study examined the involvement of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopaminergic systems in behavioral changes in mice fed a diet high in ω-3 PUFAs. Mice fed a diet containing about double the amount of ω-3 PUFAs (krill oil (KO) diet) exerted shorter immobility times in the forced swim test (FST) than mice fed a control diet, containing only α-linolenic acid (ALA) as ω-3 PUFAs. The shorter immobility times were observed in both male and female mice. A dopamine metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, increased in the NAc in male mice fed the KO diet when compared with those fed the control diet. In addition, dopamine, 3-methoxytyramine, and homovanillic acid increased in the NAc in female mice fed the KO diet. Notably, the effects of the KO diet on the immobility time in the FST were abolished by microinjection of sulpiride, an antagonist of D2-like receptors, into the NAc. A similar microinjection of an antagonist selective for D1-like receptors, SKF83566, also abolished the reduction in immobility in the FST. Moreover, we found that tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells increased in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in mice fed the KO diet. These results suggest that modulation of the VTA-NAc dopaminergic pathway is one of the mechanisms by which a KO diet rich in ω-3 PUFAs reduces the immobility behavior in the mouse FST.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Takeuchi E ; Yamada D ; Suzuki S ; Saitoh A ; Itoh M ; Hayashi T ; Yamada M ; Wada K ; Sekiguchi M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0230647 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBiogenic Monoamines/analysis/metabolism\r\n*Diet\r\nDopamine/metabolism\r\nDopamine Antagonists/pharmacology\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nFemale\r\nMale\r\nMaze Learning/drug effects\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nNucleus Accumbens/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nReceptors, Dopamine D2/metabolism\r\nTyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/metabolism\r\nVentral Tegmental Area/enzymology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Takeuchi E, Yamada D, Suzuki S, Saitoh A, Itoh M, Hayashi T, Yamada M, Wada K, and Sekiguchi M (2020) Participation of the nucleus accumbens dopaminergic system in the antidepressant-like actions of a diet rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids..

However, clinical studies concerning the association between lipid levels and depression are inconsistent. Adipokines (like leptin and adiponectin) and ghrelin are strongly associated with lipid metabolism. Fish oil, which is reported to possess antidepressant effect, also have beneficial effects on lipid metabolism and the cardiovascular system. In the present study, we investigated lipid metabolism in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and the effect of fish oil on lipid profiles, aforementioned adipokines and ghrelin. METHODS: Sucrose preference test (SPT), open field test (OFT) and forced swimming test (FST) were used to evaluate the antidepressant-like effects of fish oil. After the behavior tests, peripheral blood were collected. Serum parameters, including fasting triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TCH), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c), free fatty acid (FFA), glucose (GLU), adipokines (leptin, adiponectin) and ghrelin were assayed. RESULTS: After 5 weeks of CUMS procedures, rats were induced to depressive-like state, and exhibited increased serum levels of TCH, HDL-c, FFA and decreased serum levels of leptin and ghrelin, whereas the serum status of adiponectin, GLU, TG and LDL-c remained stable. Fish oil treatment showed robust antidepressant effect and reversed the stress-induced lipid disturbance and decrease in serum concentration of ghrelin. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that CUMS altered the serum levels of lipid profiles, leptin and ghrelin in rats. Fish oil supplementation not only provided antidepressant-like effects, but also reversed the altered lipid profiles and ghrelin level in serum. Our data indicated that fish oil treatment exerts anti-depressant effect and regulates lipid disturbance simultaneously.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tang M ; Jiang P ; Li H ; Liu Y ; Cai H ; Dang R ; Zhu W ; Cao L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12906-015-0778-1 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nDepression\r\nDietary Supplements\r\n*Fish Oils/administration & dosage/pharmacology\r\nLipid Metabolism/*drug effects\r\nLipids/blood\r\nRats\r\nStress, Physiological/*drug effects\r\nStress, Psychological/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tang M, Jiang P, Li H, Liu Y, Cai H, Dang R, Zhu W, and Cao L (2015) Fish oil supplementation alleviates depressant-like behaviors and modulates lipid profiles in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress..

Recent evidence has indicated that tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) are related to the cleavage of pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) into its mature form. Chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) is widely used to induce depressive behaviors in rodents. Therefore, we investigated the effects of PUFAs and sertraline on tPA/PAI-1 system in CUMS rats. After 5 weeks of CUMS procedures, the rats were induced to a depressive-like state. The expressions of PAI-1 and proBDNF were increased in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of CUMS rats. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) or sertraline administration reversed the changes in behavioral test and induced the expression of tPA in certain brain areas, but failed to restore the CUMS-induced PAI-1 expression. Meanwhile, the antidepressant treatment also accelerated the extracellular conversion of proBDNF into mature BDNF in CUMS rats. Our results firstly showed the synchronously altered balance of tPA/PAI-1 system in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of CUMS rats, which was partly ameliorated by PUFAs and sertraline medication, providing new evidence for the involvement of tPA/PAI-1 system in the progression and treatment of depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tang M ; Jiang P ; Li H ; Cai H ; Liu Y ; Gong H ; Zhang L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.11.054 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBody Weight\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nChronic Disease\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*pharmacology\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/physiopathology\r\nPlasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1/*metabolism\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/drug effects/physiopathology\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSertraline/*pharmacology\r\nStress, Psychological/physiopathology\r\nTissue Plasminogen Activator/*metabolism\r\nBrain-derived neurotrophic factor\r\nChronic unpredicted mild stress\r\nPlasminogen activator inhibitor-1\r\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nSertraline\r\nTissue plasminogen activator","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tang M, Jiang P, Li H, Cai H, Liu Y, Gong H, and Zhang L (2015) Antidepressant-like effect of n-3 PUFAs in CUMS rats: role of tPA/PAI-1 system..

Although Ω-3 fatty acids possess anti-inflammatory properties, there is limited evidence directly linking the modulating effects of Ω-3 fatty acids on neuroimmune and neurochemistry to the antidepressant actions. METHODS: A between-groups design was used to assess the effects of reproductive status (virgin or parous) and Ω-3 fatty acids content (control and supplementary). Serum inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-1a, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-a, IFN-γ) were evaluated using the Bio-Plex Luminex System. Moreover, we also measured the protein levels of Purinergic type 2X7 receptor (P2X7R), NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB). Lastly, we assessed the function of various neurotransmitter systems to link the inflammatory response and neurotransmitter metabolism. RESULTS: Pro-inflammatory cyrokines, including IL-1a, IL-6, TNF-a and IFN-γ were markedly induced in the serum of parous rats, although no significantly depressive-like behavior was found. Meanwhile, NLRP3 and NF-κB were decreased in certain brain areas. Moreover, gestational stress significantly induced neurochemical disturbance, which is partly restored by Ω-3 fatty acids supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings strengthen the link between inflammation, neurochemistry and postpartum depression, and further provide novel insights into the antidepressant effect of Ω-3 fatty acids.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tang M ; Dang R ; Liu S ; Zhang M ; Zheng Y ; Yang R ; Yin T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12944-018-0894-2 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrain/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology\r\nCytokines/*blood\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*metabolism/pharmacology\r\nGene Expression Regulation\r\n*Inflammation\r\nNF-kappa B/genetics\r\nNLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein/genetics\r\nNerve Tissue Proteins/genetics\r\nNeurochemistry\r\nRats\r\nNOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)\r\nNeuroinflammatary factors\r\nNeurotransmission\r\nNuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB)\r\nPurinergic type 2X7 (P2X7)\r\nΩ-3 fatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tang M, Dang R, Liu S, Zhang M, Zheng Y, Yang R, and Yin T (2018) Ω-3 fatty acids-supplementary in gestation alleviates neuroinflammation and modulates neurochemistry in rats..

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs), which are reported to possess antidepressant effect, have also been shown to regulate metabolism. To further clarify the potential link between ω-3 PUFAs and stress-induced metabolic disturbances, metabolic-related parameters including body weight, visceral fat, fatty acid composition and serum parameters, such as serum lipids, free fatty acid (FFA), glucose (GLU), calcium and phosphorus in rats were measured. Moreover, hepatic insulin induced gene (INSIG)/sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) pathway was also investigated. After 5 weeks of chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) administration, rats were induced to a depressive-like state and exhibited decreased serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL-c), body weight and visceral fat, accompanied by altered C18:2n6c and ω-3/ω-6 PUFAs. Supplement of ω-3 PUFAs showed robust antidepressant effects and has beneficial effects on lipid profile. On the contrary, ω-3 PUFAs deficiency induced the visceral fat accumulation and decreased the serum calcium and phosphorus in stressed rats. Additionally, CUMS significantly increased hepatic expressions of SREBP-cleavage activating protein (SCAP)/SREBP-1 and decreased the expression of INSIG-1. This disturbance of SREBPs system is aggravated by ω-3 PUFAs deficiency and alleviated by ω-3 PUFAs supplementation. This study discloses the novel findings that ω-3 PUFAs deficiency will exacerbate the metabolic disturbances in stressed rats. Furthermore, supplementation of ω-3 PUFAs on individuals with a high risk of depression might be an effective way to prevent metabolic disorders accompanied by depression with the involvement of INSIG/SREBP pathway.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tang M ; Floyd S ; Cai H ; Zhang M ; Yang R ; Dang R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1039/c9fo00076c ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nDepression/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/psychology\r\nDietary Supplements/analysis\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIntracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism\r\nMale\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1/genetics/*metabolism\r\nStress, Physiological/*drug effects\r\nStress, Psychological","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tang M, Floyd S, Cai H, Zhang M, Yang R, and Dang R (2019) The status of ω-3 PUFAs influence chronic unpredicted mild stress-induced metabolic side effects in rats through INSIG/SREBP pathway..

Dietary modifications and medicinal plants like olives can be used as effective strategies due to their antioxidant, immune-modulatory, antiinflammatory, and anticonvulsant properties. Considering the compositional alterations in olive fruits during ripening, the antidepressant potential of olive fruits at different degrees of ripeness, that is, un-ripened (green) and ripened (black) was investigated. Rats were randomly divided into five groups: G(0) (Normal diet), G(1) (Normal diet + smoke exposure (SE), G(2) (Normal diet + SE + Citalopram), G(3) (Normal diet + SE + Green olive extract), and G(4) (Normal diet + SE + Black olive extract). Depressive-like behaviors were induced in all groups through cigarette smoke exposure except G(0) . Green and black olive extracts prevented depressive behaviors by reducing the immobility time of rats in forced swim test and tail suspension test while increased the latency to respond in hot plate assay. Moreover, lipid peroxidation in brain tissue was reduced with citalopram, green, and black olive extracts. Additionally, treatments also enhanced the antioxidant pool of brain tissues. Histological examination revealed that olive extracts and citalopram prevented cigarette smoke-induced moderate to severe necrosis and congestion in the brain parenchyma and elucidated antidepressant potential by improving the expression of monoamine oxidase-A, solute carrier family 6 member 4, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor genes. Conclusively, olives may act as a promising antidepressant agent in ameliorating cigarette smoke-induced depressive-like behaviors. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Olive extracts at both ripening stages revealed an antidepressant-like effect almost similar to the standard antidepressant drug and also prevented oxidative damages. Therefore, from the current findings, it can be recommended that food ingredients with antidepressant potential like olives should be incorporated in future interventions to combat depression/psychiatric anomalies and diet therapy should be encouraged to alleviate lifestyle-related disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tariq U ; Butt MS ; Pasha I ; Faisal MN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/jfbc.14014 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nFruit\r\n*Neuroprotective Agents\r\n*Olea\r\nPlant Extracts/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSmoke/adverse effects\r\nSmoking\r\nantidepressant\r\nfunctional food\r\ngene expression\r\nneuroprotection\r\nolives\r\noxidative stress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tariq U, Butt MS, Pasha I, and Faisal MN (2021) Neuroprotective effects of Olea europaea L. fruit extract against cigarette smoke-induced depressive-like behaviors in Sprague-Dawley rats..

METHODS: This study was a double-blinded, parallel group, randomized controlled trial that compared the intervention group, receiving omega-3 fatty acids, with a control group, receiving a placebo supplement. Participants receiving omega-3 fatty acids took 15 × 300 mg capsules per day for 12 weeks. The total daily dose of omega-3 PUFAs was 500 mg docosahexaenoic acid and 1000 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The Beck Depression Inventory®-II (BDI-II) was used to assess the severity of depression after treatment. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of treatment, BDI-II scores were significantly lower in the placebo and omega-3 group, when compared to their respective baseline scores (Placebo: t = - 4.6, p < 0.01; Omega-3: t = - 7.3, p < 0.01). However, after 12 weeks of treatment, we found no significant difference between both groups with respect to changes in the BDI-II scores (0.7; 95% CI, - 0.7 to 2.1; p = 0.30). LIMITATIONS: This study did not measure blood omega-3 fatty acid concentration and presented a high-dropout rate. Moreover, our results may not be generalizable to other regions. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that a combination of omega-3 fatty acids and psychoeducation and psychoeducation alone can contribute to an improvement in symptoms in people with mild to moderate depression. However, there is no difference between the interventions in ameliorating symptoms of depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tayama J ; Ogawa S ; Nakaya N ; Sone T ; Hamaguchi T ; Takeoka A ; Hamazaki K ; Okamura H ; Yajima J ; Kobayashi M ; Hayashida M ; Shirabe S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2018.11.039 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDepression\r\nDepressive Disorder/*therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/therapeutic use\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nPsychotherapy/*education\r\nOmega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nPsychoeducation\r\nPsychological intervention\r\nWorkers, depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tayama J, Ogawa S, Nakaya N, Sone T, Hamaguchi T, Takeoka A, Hamazaki K, Okamura H, Yajima J, Kobayashi M, Hayashida M, and Shirabe S (2019) Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and psychological intervention for workers with mild to moderate depression: A double-blind randomized controlled trial..

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between (cumulative measures of) markers of three biological stress systems and n-3 PUFA and DHA plasma levels. DESIGN: Plasma n-3 PUFA and DHA were measured using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance in 2724 participants from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Linear regression analyses (adjusted for sociodemographic, sampling, lifestyle and somatic disease variables) associated inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha), HPA-axis (cortisol awakening response and evening cortisol) and ANS (heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia and pre-ejection period) markers and cumulative indices within and across stress systems as independent variables with n-3 PUFA and DHA levels as dependent variables. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 41.8 (SD = 13.1) and 65.7% were female. Higher levels of all three inflammation markers (Beta=-.146 to -.073, all p-values<.001), evening cortisol (Beta=-.045, p = .033) and heart rate (Beta=-.080, p < 0.001) were significantly negatively associated with n-3 PUFA. Suggesting an exposure-response relationship, a higher number of markers indicative of inflammation and hyperactive HPA-axis (p < .001 and p = .003, respectively), but not of ANS dysregulation, was found in persons with lower n-3 PUFA levels. An exposure-response relationship was also found for having a higher number of different stress system dysregulations with lower n-3 PUFA levels (p < .001). For DHA, results were in line with those for n-3 PUFA, although with slightly smaller effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed that having various (cumulative) indicators of dysregulation of three biological stress systems was significantly associated with lower n-3 PUFA and DHA plasma levels. If low n-3 PUFA levels are the cause of dysregulated stress systems, then n-3 PUFA supplementation might reduce biological stress and thereby improve somatic and mental health.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Thesing CS ; Bot M ; Milaneschi Y ; Giltay EJ ; Penninx BWJH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.07.002 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAutonomic Nervous System/metabolism\r\nBiomarkers/blood\r\nC-Reactive Protein\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/*analysis/blood\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*analysis/blood/metabolism\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nHeart Rate\r\nHumans\r\nHydrocortisone/analysis\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/metabolism\r\nImmune System/metabolism\r\nInflammation/metabolism\r\nInterleukin-6\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNetherlands\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System/metabolism\r\nRespiratory Sinus Arrhythmia\r\nStress, Physiological/*physiology\r\nTumor Necrosis Factor-alpha\r\nAutonomic nervous system\r\nBiological stress\r\nHPA-axis\r\nInflammation\r\nOmega-3\r\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Thesing CS, Bot M, Milaneschi Y, Giltay EJ, and Penninx BWJH (2018) Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels and dysregulations in biological stress systems..

In the recent years mood disorders occur in the earlier age. The prevalence of major depression (MD) is about 1-2% in preadolescent children and 3-8% in adolescents. When the major depression is not treated there is a big risk of worsening of symptoms, risk of suicide and development of comorbid disorders. The quality of life of the patient and its family is decreasing in the whole view. The molecular basis of major depression is not well known. The main pathomechanism of MD is in noradrenergic, serotonergic and dopaminergic pathway dysregulation, nutition factors, which can influence structure and metabolism of lipids. It was found decreased level of omega 3 fatty aids (FA), increased ratio of omega 6/omega 3 FA in the serum and in erythrocyte membrane. It is supposed that the oxidative neuronal injury can be prevented by dietary supplementation of antioxidants and that membrane phospholipids can be repaired by dietary supplementation of fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids may also participate in modulation of membrane fluidity, which influences the transmission of neurotransmitters. The membrane fluidity is affected by the ratio of phospholipids to free cholesterol. In addition, activation of the inflammatory response was found in depressive patients through increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, interferon gamma, TNF-alpha) and eicosanoids (prostaglandin E2) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. This results in increased lipid peroxidation and degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which may result in increased oxidative stress. Omega-3 fatty acids also stimulate anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) or inhibit the cyclooxygenase, platelet aggregation and formation of eicosanoids. The potential molecular mechanisms will be discussed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Trebaticka J ; Durackova Z ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.10.824 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Trebaticka J, and Durackova Z (2014) Psychiatric disorders and omega-3 fatty acids..

Omega-3 fatty acids (FA) are emerging as a promising adjuvant therapy for depressive disorder (DD) in paediatric patients. The primary objective of this pilot, single-centre, randomized, double-blind controlled study was to compare the efficacy of an Omega-3 FA fish oil emulsion with a control oil emulsion alongside standard treatment for depressive symptoms in children and adolescents suffering from depressive disorder (DD) and mixed anxiety depressive disorder (MADD). METHODS: 38 children (12 patients were treated and diagnosed for at least 1 month before enrolment, 26 patients were first-time diagnosed as DD) aged 11-17 years were randomised 1:1 to the intervention (Omega-3 FA, 19 patients) or active comparator (Omega-6 FA, 19 patients) groups. Children's depression inventory (CDI) ratings were performed at baseline, every 2 weeks for a 12-week intervention period and at 4-week post-intervention. 35 patients (17 in Omega-3 and 18 in Omega-6 groups) who completed the whole intervention period were evaluated. Patients from Omega-3 group were stratified according to diagnosis into two subgroups (DD-10/17 and mixed anxiety depressive disorder (MADD)-7/17 patients) and in the Omega-6 group into DD-10/18 and MADD-8/18 patients. Groups were evaluated separately. Differences between-groups were tested with the Student´s t test or non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures and Friedman test were used to analyse the Treatment effect for response in CDI score. p < 0.05 was considered significant in all statistical analyses. RESULTS: Significant reductions in CDI scores in 35 analysed patients who completed 12 weeks intervention were observed after 12 weeks of intervention only in the Omega-3 group (p = 0.034). After stratification to depressive disorder and mixed anxiety depressive disorder subgroups, the DD subgroup receiving the Omega-3 FA fish oil showed statistically greater improvement (score reduction after 8 week treatment of -9.1 CDI, p = 0.0001) when compared to the MADD subgroup (score reduction after 8 week treatment -4.24 CDI, p = 0.271). CONCLUSIONS: CDI scores were reduced in the Omega-3 group and the depression subgroup had greater improvement than the mixed depressive/anxiety group.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Male rats were fed normal, fish oil-rich or olive oil-rich diets for 14 weeks. Chronic mild stress (CMS) was administered from week 2. The sucrose preference test (SPT) and forced swimming test (FST) were used to determine depressive-like behavior. The SPT results revealed that the CMS, CMS with imipramine (CMS+P) treatment, and CMS with olive oil diet (CMS+O) groups exhibited significantly reduced sucrose intake from week 8, whereas the fish oil diet (CMS+F) group exhibited significantly reduced sucrose intake from week 10. The FST results showed that the immobile time of the CMS+F group was significantly less than that of the CMS-only group. Next generation sequencing (NGS) results showed CMS significantly reduced the abundance of Lactobacillus and increased that of Marvinbryantia and Ruminiclostridium_6. However, the CMS+F group showed an increase in the abundance of Eisenbergiella, Ruminococcaceae_UCG_009, and Holdemania, whereas the CMS+O group showed an increase in the abundance of Akkermansia. CONCLUSIONS: CMS stimuli altered the gut microbiome in depressed rats. Fish oil and olive oil exerted part of a prebiotic-like effect to ameliorate dysbiosis induced by CMS. However, only fish oil ameliorated depressive-like symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tung TH ; Tung YT ; Lin IH ; Shih CK ; Nguyen NTK ; Shabrina A ; Huang SY ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/biom9100516 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBacteria/classification/drug effects/genetics/isolation & purification\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/metabolism/microbiology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDysbiosis/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nFish Oils/*administration & dosage/pharmacology\r\nGastrointestinal Microbiome/drug effects\r\nHigh-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing\r\nImipramine/administration & dosage/pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nOlive Oil/*administration & dosage/pharmacology\r\nRats\r\nSucrose/metabolism\r\nchronic mild stress\r\ndepression\r\nfish oil\r\ngut microbiota\r\nolive oil","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tung TH, Tung YT, Lin IH, Shih CK, Nguyen NTK, Shabrina A, and Huang SY (2019) Fish Oil, but Not Olive Oil, Ameliorates Depressive-Like Behavior and Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis in Rats under Chronic Mild Stress..

The etiology of depression is complicated and includes genetic factors, stress, aging, and special physical status (pregnancy, metabolic syndrome, and trauma). Numerous animal and human studies have demonstrated that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are highly correlated to cognition and depression. These nutritional antidepressants, including EPA and DHA, have a range of neurobiological activities contributing to their potential antidepressant effects. Our preclinical and clinical studies have indicated that n-3 PUFA supplementation in addition to standard antidepressant medications may provide synergistic neuroprotective and antioxidant/inflammatory effects. To translate our preliminary findings into clinical application, this paper reviews the existing evidence on the antidepressant effects of n-3 PUFAs and the potential underlying mechanisms, which include modulation of chronic lowgrade inflammation and the corresponding changes in peripheral blood immune biomarkers.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tung TH ; Nguyen NTK ; Huang SY ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.5650/jos.ess21209 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\n*Anti-Inflammatory Agents\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage\r\nAntioxidants\r\nDepressive Disorder/etiology/immunology/*therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/administration & dosage\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/administration & dosage\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage\r\nFish Oils/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacology\r\nHumans\r\nNeuroprostanes\r\ndepression\r\nfish oil\r\nlow-grade inflammation\r\nn-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tung TH, Nguyen NTK, and Huang SY (2021) New Insights into Depressive Disorder with Respect to Low-Grade Inflammation and Fish Oil Intake..

Several authors have described histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as a class of drugs that improves long-term memory formation. The current study examined the effects of maternal deprivation (MD) and chronic mild stress (CMS), which have been shown as animal models of depression, and the effects of sodium butyrate (SB), a HDAC inhibitor, on recognition memory. Considering that neurotrophic factors has been pointed as a key event involved with cognition and depressive disorder, levels of neurotrophic factors (BDNF, NGF and GDNF) were also investigated. MD and CMS induced depressive-like behavior in the forced swimming test (FST) and memory impairment in the object recognition (OR) test, without altering locomotor activity of rats. In addition, SB was able to reverse the stress-induced neurotrophic factors decrease and reversed memory impairment. The results indicate that the stress both at early and later stage of life may induce cognitive impairment in animals and neurotrofic factors (BDNF, NGF and GDNF) levels decrease. SB treatment improved the recognition memory and reversed the neurotrophins levels decreased in the hippocampus of rats submitted to the MD and CMS models. Together, our results reinforce the notion that SB displays a specific antidepressant profile and improve cognition in MD and CMS rats that may be, at least in part, due to its upregulation of neurotrophic factors.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Valvassori SS ; Varela RB ; Arent CO ; Dal-Pont GC ; Bobsin TS ; Budni J ; Reus GZ ; Quevedo J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1567202611666140829162158 ","Keywords":"Analysis of Variance\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nButyric Acid/*therapeutic use\r\nCognition Disorders/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/*etiology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nExploratory Behavior/drug effects\r\nGene Expression Regulation/drug effects\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nIntercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism\r\nMale\r\n*Maternal Deprivation\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nRecognition, Psychology/drug effects\r\nStress, Psychological/*complications/pathology\r\nSwimming/psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Valvassori SS, Varela RB, Arent CO, Dal-Pont GC, Bobsin TS, Budni J, Reus GZ, and Quevedo J (2014) Sodium butyrate functions as an antidepressant and improves cognition with enhanced neurotrophic expression in models of maternal deprivation and chronic mild stress..

Chronic mild stress was established by water deprivation, food deprivation, restraint stress, isolation and flashing lights. Sodium butyrate or saline was administered twice a day for 7 days before the behavioral tests. Depressive behavior was evaluated using the forced swim test. The activity of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes (succinate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase) and of mitochondrial chain complexes (I, II, II-III and IV) was measured in the striatum of rats. From these analyses it can be observed that sodium butyrate reversed the depressive-like behavior observed in both animal models of depression. Additionally, maternal deprivation and chronic mild stress inhibited mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and increased the activity of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. Sodium butyrate treatment reversed -maternal deprivation and chronic mild stress- induced dysfunction in the striatum of rats. In conclusion, sodium butyrate showed antidepressant effects in maternal deprivation and chronic mild stress-treated rats, and this effect can be attributed to its action on the neurochemical pathways related to depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Valvassori SS ; Resende WR ; Budni J ; Dal-Pont GC ; Bavaresco DV ; Réus GZ ; Carvalho AF ; Gonçalves CL ; Furlanetto CB ; Streck EL ; Quevedo J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1567202612666150728121121 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnimals, Newborn\r\nButyric Acid/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nCitric Acid Cycle/drug effects\r\nCorpus Striatum/drug effects/*metabolism\r\n*Depression/drug therapy/etiology/pathology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nElectron Transport Chain Complex Proteins/metabolism\r\nExploratory Behavior/drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects\r\nHistone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nImmobility Response, Tonic/drug effects\r\nMalate Dehydrogenase/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMaternal Deprivation\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nStress, Psychological/*complications/etiology\r\nSuccinate Dehydrogenase/metabolism\r\nSwimming/psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Valvassori SS, Resende WR, Budni J, Dal-Pont GC, Bavaresco DV, Réus GZ, Carvalho AF, Gonçalves CL, Furlanetto CB, Streck EL, and Quevedo J (2015) Sodium Butyrate, a Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor, Reverses Behavioral and Mitochondrial Alterations in Animal Models of Depression Induced by Early- or Late-life Stress..

They have been extensively studied for their effects in human nutrition and health. This paper provides an overview on metabolism, sources, dietary intake, and status of n-3 LCPUFA. A summary of the dietary recommendations for n-3 LCPUFAs for different age groups as well as specific physiological conditions is provided. Evidence for n-3 LCPUFA in cardiovascular diseases, including new studies, is reviewed. Expert recommendations generally support a beneficial effect of n-3 LCPUFA on cardiovascular health and recommend a daily intake of 500 mg as DHA and EPA, or 1-2 servings of fish per week. The role of n-3 LCPUFA on brain health, in particular neurodegenerative disorders and depression, is reviewed. The evidence for beneficial effects of n-3 LCPUFA on neurodegenerative disorders is non-conclusive despite mechanistic support and observational data. Hence, no definite n-3 LCPUFA expert recommendations are made. Data for the beneficial effect of n-3 LCPUFA on depression are generally compelling. Expert recommendations have been established: 200-300 mg/day for depression; up to 1-2 g/day for major depressive disorder. Recent studies support a beneficial role of n-3 LCPUFAs in reducing the risk for premature birth, with a daily intake of 600-800 mg of DHA during pregnancy. Finally, international experts recently reviewed the scientific evidence on DHA and arachidonic acid (ARA) in infant nutrition and concluded that the totality of data support that infant and follow-on formulas should provide both DHA and ARA at levels similar to those in breast milk. In conclusion, the available scientific data support that dietary recommendations for n-3 LCPUFA should be established for the general population and for subjects with specific physiological conditions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Van Dael P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4162/nrp.2021.15.2.137 ","Keywords":"Docosahexaenoic acid\r\nadult\r\nbrain\r\neicosapentaenoic acid\r\nheart\r\ninfant\r\npregnancy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Van Dael P (2021) Role of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in human nutrition and health: review of recent studies and recommendations..

Here we provide a review of the recent literature on evidence for using such interventions in the treatment of anxiety and depression. RECENT FINDINGS: With regard to herbal treatments, kava is effective in reducing anxiety symptoms and St John's wort in treating mild to moderate depression. The association of kava with hepatotoxicity, however, is a significant concern. Promising data continue to emerge for the use of omega-3 fatty acids in managing depression. Evidence for the use of acupuncture in treating anxiety disorders is becoming stronger, although there is currently minimal empirical evidence for the use of aromatherapy or mindfulness-based meditation. SUMMARY: The evidence base for the efficacy of the majority of complementary and alternative interventions used to treat anxiety and depression remains poor. Recent systematic reviews all point to a significant lack of methodologically rigorous studies within the field. This lack of evidence does not diminish the popularity of such interventions within the general Western population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"van der Watt G ; Laugharne J ; Janca A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/YCO.0b013e3282f2d814 ","Keywords":"Acupuncture Therapy\r\nAnxiety Disorders/diagnosis/psychology/*therapy\r\nAromatherapy\r\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\n*Complementary Therapies\r\nDepressive Disorder/diagnosis/psychology/*therapy\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine\r\nHumans\r\nHypericum\r\nKava\r\nMeditation\r\nPhytotherapy\r\nPlant Extracts/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"van der Watt G, Laugharne J, and Janca A (2008) Complementary and alternative medicine in the treatment of anxiety and depression..

Several innovative and experimental approaches have been emerging recently, including use of the dissociative anesthetic ketamine and other antagonists of central NMDA glutamate receptors, as well as unsaturated fatty acids, anti-inflammatory agents, and possibly probiotic methods. METHOD: We reviewed relevant reports from the past decade. FINDINGS: Ketamine, a phencyclidine-like NMDA-glutamate receptor antagonist, has emerged as a highly innovative, experimental treatment for treatment-resistant unipolar major depression, possibly in bipolar depression, and with brief antisuicidal effects. Its limitations include poor bioavailability, rapid but short-lived effects, and little information about long-term benefits and safety of repeated administration. Polyunsaturated fatty acids critical for the structure and functioning of neuronal and other cell membranes have some evidence of benefit as experimental treatments for depression including in BD. There also is evidence of altered expression of peptides associated with inflammation in mood disorder patients, encouraging experimental treatment with anti-inflammatory agents; of these, the COX-II inhibitor celecoxib has shown some evidence of benefit. The concept of altering intestinal flora with probiotic treatments to treat mood disorders remains speculative. CONCLUSION: Ketamine represents an innovative, rapidly acting, experimental treatment for bipolar depression with practical limitations. Unsaturated fatty acids and anti-inflammatory agents have inconsistent support; probiotic treatments lack evidence. These innovative approaches require much more clinical investigation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vazquez GH ; Camino S ; Tondo L ; Baldessarini RJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1871527316666170728165648 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnti-Inflammatory Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nFatty Acids/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nKetamine/*therapeutic use\r\nProbiotics/*therapeutic use\r\nAnti-inflammatory\r\nNMDA receptor\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ndepression\r\ninflammation\r\nketamine\r\npolyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nprobiotics","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vazquez GH, Camino S, Tondo L, and Baldessarini RJ (2017) Potential Novel Treatments for Bipolar Depression: Ketamine, Fatty Acids, Anti-inflammatory Agents, and Probiotics..

Researchers reported that depression increases the possibility of future cardiac abnormalities by approximately 30%. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop therapeutic interventions to treat depression and associated cardiac abnormalities. The present study was conducted to evaluate the prophylactic effect of rosmarinic acid (RA) against chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depression associated cardiac abnormalities in Wistar rats. The CUS paradigm, which comprised several stressors, was employed for 40 days to induce depressive-like behavior and associated cardiac abnormalities in rats. Along with CUS, RA at a dose of 25 and 50 mg/kg was administered orally to two groups of animals for 40 days. Behavioral tests (forced swim test and sucrose consumption test) and molecular biomarkers (corticosterone and serotonin) were performed. Electrocardiography was performed before CUS (Day 0), Day 20, and Day 40 to study electrocardiogram parameters. Furthermore, changes in body weight, organ weight, tissue lipid peroxidation, glutathione, catalase, cTn-I, MMP-2, and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) were estimated. Our results showed that RA treatment caused a reduction in immobility period, adrenal hyperplasia, corticosterone level, tissue lipid peroxidation, cTn-I, MMP-2, proinflammatory cytokines, and QRS complex duration, while an increase in sucrose consumption, brain serotonin level, T-wave width, glutathione, and catalase activity as compared with the CUS-control group. The results of our study proved that RA administration ameliorates CUS-induced depression-associated cardiac abnormalities in rats via serotonergic, oxidative, and inflammatory pathways.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Verma H ; Shivavedi N ; Tej GNVC ; Kumar M ; Nayak PK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/jbt.23160 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nRats\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nBiomarkers/metabolism\r\nCatalase/metabolism\r\nCinnamates\r\nCopper\r\n*Corticosterone/pharmacology\r\n*Depression/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDepsides\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDiterpenes\r\nGlutathione/metabolism\r\nInterleukin-6/metabolism\r\nMatrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism\r\nOxidative Stress\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nSucrose\r\nTumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism\r\nchronic unpredictable stress\r\nelectrocardiography\r\noxidative stress\r\nproinflammatory cytokines\r\nrosmarinic acid","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Verma H, Shivavedi N, Tej GNVC, Kumar M, and Nayak PK (2022) Prophylactic administration of rosmarinic acid ameliorates depression-associated cardiac abnormalities in Wistar rats: Evidence of serotonergic, oxidative, and inflammatory pathways..

The aim was to assess the impact of omega-3 supplementation (Ω3) and psychoeducational psychotherapy (PEP), each alone and in combination, on EF in youth with mood disorders. We completed secondary analyses of two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Ω3 and PEP for children with depression and bipolar disorder. METHODS: Ninety-five youths with depression or bipolar disorder not otherwise specified/cyclothymic disorder were randomized in 12-week RCTs. Two capsules (Ω3 or placebo) were given twice daily (1.87 g Ω3 total daily, mostly eicosapentaenoic acid). Families randomized to PEP participated in twice-weekly 50-min sessions. Analyses assess impact of interventions on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF) parent-report Global Executive Composite (GEC) and two subscales, Behavior Regulation (BRI) and Metacognition (MI) Indices. Intent-to-treat repeated measures ANOVAs, using multiple imputation for missing data, included all 95 randomized participants. Trials were registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01341925 & NCT01507753. RESULTS: Participants receiving Ω3 (aggregating combined and monotherapy) improved significantly more than aggregated placebo on GEC (p = .001, d = .70), BRI (p = .004, d = .49), and MI (p = .04, d = .41). Ω3 alone (d = .49) and combined with PEP (d = .67) each surpassed placebo on GEC. Moderation by attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbidity was nonsignificant although those with ADHD showed nominally greater gains. PEP monotherapy had negligible effect. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased impairment in EF was associated with Ω3 supplementation in youth with mood disorders. Research examining causal associations of Ω3, EF, and mood symptoms is warranted.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vesco AT ; Young AS ; Arnold LE ; Fristad MA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/jcpp.12830 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nBipolar Disorder/*physiopathology/*therapy\r\nChild\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/*physiopathology/*therapy\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/pharmacology\r\nExecutive Function/*drug effects\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMetacognition/*drug effects\r\n*Outcome Assessment, Health Care\r\nPsychotherapy/*methods\r\n*Self-Control\r\nSchool children\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ndepression\r\nnutrition\r\npsychotherapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vesco AT, Young AS, Arnold LE, and Fristad MA (2018) Omega-3 supplementation associated with improved parent-rated executive function in youth with mood disorders: secondary analyses of the omega 3 and therapy (OATS) trials..

Environmental stress and genetic factors acting through immunological and endocrine responses generate structural and functional changes in the brain, inducing neurogenesis and neurotransmission dysfunction. Terpineol, monoterpenoid alcohol, has shown immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects, but there is no report about its antidepressant potential. Herein, we used a single lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection to induce a depressive-like effect in the tail suspension test (TST) and the splash test (ST) for a preventive and therapeutic experimental schedule. Furthermore, we investigated the antidepressant-like mechanism of action of terpineol while using molecular and pharmacological approaches. Terpineol showed a coherent predicted binding mode mainly against CB1 and CB2 receptors and also against the D2 receptor during docking modeling analyses. The acute administration of terpineol produced the antidepressant-like effect, since it significantly reduced the immobility time in TST (100-200 mg/kg, p.o.) as compared to the control group. Moreover, terpineol showed an antidepressant-like effect in the preventive treatment that was blocked by a nonselective dopaminergic receptor antagonist (haloperidol), a selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist (sulpiride), a selective CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist/inverse agonist (AM281), and a potent and selective CB2 cannabinoid receptor inverse agonist (AM630), but it was not blocked by a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist (caffeine) or a β-adrenoceptor antagonist (propranolol). In summary, molecular docking suggests that CB1 and CB2 receptors are the most promising targets of terpineol action. Our data showed terpineol antidepressant-like modulation by CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors and D2-dopaminergic receptors to further corroborate our molecular evidence.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vieira G ; Cavalli J ; Gonçalves ECD ; Braga SFP ; Ferreira RS ; Santos ARS ; Cola M ; Raposo NRB ; Capasso R ; Dutra RC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/biom10050792 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnti-Inflammatory Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBinding Sites\r\nCannabinoid Receptor Modulators/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nDopamine Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nHindlimb Suspension/adverse effects\r\nLipopolysaccharides/toxicity\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMolecular Docking Simulation\r\nMonoterpenes/*therapeutic use\r\nProtein Binding\r\nReceptors, Cannabinoid/chemistry/metabolism\r\nReceptors, Dopamine D2/chemistry/metabolism\r\ncannabinoid receptor\r\ndepression\r\ndopaminergic receptor\r\nphytocannabinoid\r\nterpenoids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vieira G, Cavalli J, Gonçalves ECD, Braga SFP, Ferreira RS, Santos ARS, Cola M, Raposo NRB, Capasso R, and Dutra RC (2020) Antidepressant-Like Effect of Terpineol in an Inflammatory Model of Depression: Involvement of the Cannabinoid System and D2 Dopamine Receptor..

Supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) during critical periods of development (pregnancy and lactation) is essential for cortical maturation, synaptogenesis and myelination, and may also mitigate the risk for cognitive deficits and psychopathologies in young adults. The present study was performed to evaluate the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) receptors, particularly of 5-HT(1A), and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the antidepressant effect of ω-3 PUFA supplementation. In Experiment 1, the antidepressant effects of fish oil were assessed by the modified forced swim test in adult rats. The data indicated a robust antidepressant effect produced by this supplementation and that treatment of the rats with WAY 100135 reversed this effect. In Experiment 2, cortical and hippocampal contents of BDNF, 5-HT, dopamine (DA) and its metabolites, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), were determined in animals subjected to the same protocol. Increased BDNF expression in the cortex and hippocampus of both age groups was detected. In 90 day-old rats, 5-HT content in the hippocampus was increased, whereas 5-HIAA formation was diminished in the fish oil group. We suggest the occurrence of a reciprocal involvement of 5-HT(1A) receptors activation and the hippocampal BDNF-increased expression mediated by fish oil supplementation. These data corroborate and expand the notion that supplementation with ω-3 PUFA produces antidepressant effects mediated by an increase in serotonergic neurotransmission, particularly in the hippocampus.

Current pharmaceutical treatment for depression remains unsatisfactory due to its limited therapeutic efficacy and undesirable side effects. There is increasing interest in looking for alternative strategies from diet for the treatment of depressive disorder. The nutrition factors have the potential to regulate several neurochemical pathways implicated in depression. This review gives an overview of the recent advances in depression treatment using nutrition factors including vitamins, polyunsaturated fatty acid, elements and natural products. The review covers most recent publications from 2016 to mid-2018. The results of basic experimental and clinical studies were summarized. The risk of deficiency and effect of intervention using nutrition factors for the depression were also discussed. Although the results are controversial in some cases due to the experimental design, the relationship has been observed between deficiency of certain nutrition factors and incidence of depression in the majority of studies. The dietary nutrition supplements may play significant or synergic role in treating or improving depressive disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wang X ; Zhao F ; Wang X ; Niu Y ; Niu L ; Wang C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1381612824666180803113106 ","Keywords":"Biological Products\r\nDepressive Disorder/*diet therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\nTrace Elements/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nVitamins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nNutrition\r\ndepression\r\nelements\r\nnatural products\r\npolyunsaturated fatty acid\r\nvitamins.","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wang X, Zhao F, Wang X, Niu Y, Niu L, and Wang C (2018) Recent Advances in Nutrition for the Treatment of Depressive Disorder..

Prolonged sleep deprivation causes cognition deficits and depression-like behavior in the model of animal experiments. Endocannabinoid system are key modulators of synaptic function, which were related to memory and mood. Although the underlying mechanism remains unknown, several studies indicated the benefits of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs, linolenic acid, 39.7 %; linoleic acid, 28 %; and oleic acid, 22 %) on brain function through the endocannabinoid system. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of dietary PUFAs on cognition deficits induced by sleep deprivation in Sprague Dawley rats. The rats were sleep deprivation continuously for 7 days and fed with PUFAs at three different dosages (2, 4 and 8 μl/g body weight) at the meantime. The effect of PUFAs on cognition was investigated by object recognition test while depressive-like behavior were detected using sucrose preference test and forced swim test. The mechanism of PUFAs was elucidated by hippocampal synaptic transmission analyses. The resluts revealed that SD led to the disorder of cognition and mood which was improved by the supplement of PUFAs. SD significantly increased the mEPSC frequency, and decreased the protein level of cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB(1)R). These changes were restored by supplement of PUFAs, which showed a similar level to the control group. Behaviour tests showed that the positive effects on repairing cognition and anxiety disorders were almost completely abolished when the CB(1)R receptor antagonist rimonabant was applied to the SD rats. These findings indicated that PUFAs are a factor regulating cognition deficits and depression induced by SD via cannabinoid type-1 receptors.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wang T ; Niu K ; Fan A ; Bi N ; Tao H ; Chen XT ; Wang HL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2020.112545 ","Keywords":"Affect/drug effects\r\nAnimals\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nCognition\r\nCognitive Dysfunction/metabolism/*physiopathology\r\nDepression/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nDiet\r\nEndocannabinoids/metabolism\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/*pharmacology\r\nGlutamic Acid/drug effects/metabolism\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nLinoleic Acid\r\nMale\r\nOleic Acid\r\n*Paeonia\r\nPatch-Clamp Techniques\r\nPlant Oils/chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nReceptor, Cannabinoid, CB1/drug effects/*metabolism\r\nSleep Deprivation/metabolism/*physiopathology\r\nSynaptic Transmission/drug effects\r\nalpha-Linolenic Acid\r\nAnxiety\r\nCannabinoid type-1 receptor\r\nCognition\r\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nSleep deprivation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wang T, Niu K, Fan A, Bi N, Tao H, Chen XT, and Wang HL (2020) Dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids alleviates cognition deficits and depression-like behaviour via cannabinoid system in sleep deprivation rats..

However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of different PUFAs ratios on the autism are still poorly understood. In the present study, a valproic acid (VPA) rat model of autism was used to study the effects of diet with different n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios on the autism, and the underlying mechanisms explored. Our results showed that rats with prenatal administration of VPA took less response time to sniff three odorants in the olfactory habituation/dishabituation tests, had lower frequency of pinning and following patterns, and had decreased hippocampal 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), increased serum 5-HT and downregulated expression of tight junction protein (occludin and claudin-1) in the colon. However, supplementation of n-3/n-6 PUFAs (1:5) in the VPA treated rats ameliorated the autistic behaviors, increased hippocampal 5-HT and tight junction expression in the colon, and decreased serum 5-HT. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of n-3/n-6 PUFAs (1:5) significantly improves VPA-induced autism-like behaviors in rats, which may be, at least partially, related to the increased hippocampal 5-HT. Furthermore, this diet can increase the expression of tight junction proteins to improve intestinal barrier impairment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wang J ; Zheng B ; Zhou D ; Xing J ; Li H ; Li J ; Zhang Z ; Zhang B ; Li P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyt.2020.552345 ","Keywords":"autism spectrum disorder\r\nintestinal barrier\r\npolyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nserotonin\r\nvalproic acid","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wang J, Zheng B, Zhou D, Xing J, Li H, Li J, Zhang Z, Zhang B, and Li P (2020) Supplementation of Diet With Different n-3/n-6 PUFA Ratios Ameliorates Autistic Behavior, Reduces Serotonin, and Improves Intestinal Barrier Impairments in a Valproic Acid Rat Model of Autism..

METHODS: The authors conducted a meta-analysis of research articles on the association of high ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs with the risk of depression published in the online article database on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library as of December 2021. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated using random effects models. Publication bias was assessed visually by funnel plots and statistically by the Egger's and Begg's tests. RESULTS: Finally, 12 studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis with a total of 66,317 participants (including 4,173 individuals with depression condition). The pooled results showed that high ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs might be positively associated with depression [OR = 1.21, 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.04∼1.41]. The I(2) test indicated that there was a substantial statistical heterogeneity across the included studies (I (2) = 54.38%, P = 0.01). Subgroup analysis showed that high ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs in blood had no significant association with depression (OR = 1.15, 95%CI: 0.88∼1.50), while high ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs in dietary supplements was positively associated with depression (OR = 1.32, 95%CI: 1.16∼1.51). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis confirmed the association between high ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs and the risk of depression. High ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs in dietary supplementation was positively associated with depression, but had no significant association in the blood. This study suggested that lowering the dietary intake of the ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs would be beneficial in the prevention of depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wang Y ; Dong L ; Pan D ; Xu D ; Lu Y ; Yin S ; Wang S ; Xia H ; Liao W ; Sun G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fnut.2022.889576 ","Keywords":"depression\r\nn-3\r\nn-6\r\npolyunsaturated fatty acids\r\nprospective study","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wang Y, Dong L, Pan D, Xu D, Lu Y, Yin S, Wang S, Xia H, Liao W, and Sun G (2022) Effect of High Ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs on Depression: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Studies..

However, it is still unclear whether the limited effect of DHA on alleviating depression is remedied by dose and chemical structure adjustment to DHA-PL. METHODS AND RESULTS: A mouse model with depression is established by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) coupled with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge to simulate the infection-triggered immune perturbation during chronic stress, and the effects of dietary 0.2% EPA-PL, 0.2% DHA-PL, 0.6% DHA-PL, and 0.6% DHA-enriched ethyl ester (DHA-EE) are comparatively investigated. The results demonstrate that dietary 0.6% DHA-PL, instead of 0.2% DHA-PL and 0.6% DHA-EE, significantly rescues the depression-like behavior with similar effects to 0.2% EPA-PL. Further studies reveal that dietary DHA-PL regulates immune dysregulation, inhibits neuroinflammation by NLRP3 inflammasome, and further improves monoamine systems and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. CONCLUSION: The limited effect of DHA on depression is remedied by chemical structure adjustment to DHA-PL and three-fold dose.

This leads to a considerable portion of the economy going for treatment as large amounts of money are spent on drugs every year. Pharmaceutical drugs are not very effective and they also have side effects that compound the problem. There are number of studies which shows that omega-3 fatty acids are proving to be very effective against the treatment of major depression disorder and other psychiatric disorders. However, the data regarding the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in depression treatment are conflicted. This article reviews the recent research showing the relation between omega-3 fatty acids and depression. The roles of the omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of depression are being studied with increased pace in the last decade due to heightened prevalence of depression. It is emphasized that omega-3 fatty acids have no record of associated side effects, which deserves greater attention for further research.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wani AL ; Bhat SA ; Ara A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.imr.2015.07.003 ","Keywords":"depression treatment\r\ndocohexanoic acid\r\neicosapentaenoic acid\r\nomega-3 fatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wani AL, Bhat SA, and Ara A (2015) Omega-3 fatty acids and the treatment of depression: a review of scientific evidence..

While research using NaB has mainly focused on its role as a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), there is also evidence that NaB affects DNA methylation. METHODS: The purpose of this study was to examine NaB's putative antidepressant-like efficacy in relation to DNA methylation changes in the prefrontal cortex of an established genetic rat model of depression (the Flinders Sensitive Line [FSL]) and its controls (the Flinders Resistant Line). RESULTS: The FSL rats had lower levels of ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1), which catalyzes the conversion of DNA methylation to hydroxymethylation. As indicated by the behavioral despair test, chronic administration of NaB had antidepressant-like effects in the FSL and was accompanied by increased levels of TET1. The TET1 upregulation was also associated with an increase of hydroxymethylation and a decrease of methylation in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), a gene associated with neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. These epigenetic changes were associated with a corresponding BDNF overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the antidepressant efficacy of HDACis and suggest that their epigenetic effects may also include DNA methylation changes that are mediated by demethylation-facilitating enzymes like TET1.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wei Y ; Melas PA ; Wegener G ; Mathé AA ; Lavebratt C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/ijnp/pyu032 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*genetics/metabolism\r\nButyric Acid/*pharmacology\r\nDNA Methylation/*drug effects\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism\r\nDioxygenases/*metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nHistone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/drug effects/metabolism\r\nRats\r\nUp-Regulation/drug effects\r\nDNA methylation\r\nTET1\r\ndepression\r\nepigenetics","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wei Y, Melas PA, Wegener G, Mathé AA, and Lavebratt C (2014) Antidepressant-like effect of sodium butyrate is associated with an increase in TET1 and in 5-hydroxymethylation levels in the Bdnf gene..

METHODS: Cognition was assessed using the Aversive Light Stimulus Avoidance Test (ALSAT). The Unavoidable Aversive Light Stimulus (UALST) and the Forced Swimming Test (FST) were used to evaluate the antidepressant-like effects of KO. Imipramine (IMIP) was used as the antidepressant reference substance. RESULTS: After 7 weeks of KO intake, both males and females treated with KO were significantly better in discriminating between the active and the inactive levers in the ALSAT from day 1 of training (p<0.01). Both KO and IMIP prevented resignation/depression on the third day in the UALST. Similarly, a shorter immobility time was observed for the KO and IMIP groups compared to the control in the FST (p<0.001). These data support a robust antidepressant-like potential and beneficial cognitive effect of KO. Changes in expression of synaptic plasticity-related genes in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were also investigated. mRNA for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) was specifically upregulated in the hippocampus of female rats receiving 7 weeks of KO supplementation (p=0.04) and a similar trend was observed in males (p=0.08). Males also exhibited an increase in prefrontal cortex expression of Arc mRNA, a key protein in long-term synaptic plasticity (p=0.05). IMIP induced clear effects on several plasticity related genes including Bdnf and Arc. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that active components (eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and astaxanthin) in KO facilitate learning processes and provide antidepressant-like effects. Our findings also suggest that KO might work through different physiological mechanisms than IMIP.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wibrand K ; Berge K ; Messaoudi M ; Duffaud A ; Panja D ; Bramham CR ; Burri L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1476-511X-12-6 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology\r\nAvoidance Learning/drug effects\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/metabolism\r\nCognition/*drug effects\r\nCytoskeletal Proteins/genetics/metabolism\r\nDepression/metabolism/physiopathology/*prevention & control\r\nDietary Fats, Unsaturated/isolation & purification/*pharmacology\r\nEuphausiacea/*chemistry\r\nFemale\r\nGene Expression/drug effects\r\nHippocampus/drug effects\r\nImipramine/pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nNerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism\r\nNeuronal Plasticity/drug effects\r\nNootropic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/drug effects\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSwimming","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wibrand K, Berge K, Messaoudi M, Duffaud A, Panja D, Bramham CR, and Burri L (2013) Enhanced cognitive function and antidepressant-like effects after krill oil supplementation in rats..

The mechanisms of such activities are still elusive and may involve retinoid X receptors (RXRs), transcription factors known to bind DHA in vitro. METHODS: Promnemonic and antidespair activities of acute DHA treatment were tested in BALBcByJ mice using spontaneous alternation and forced swim test, respectively. The involvement of retinoid receptors in such DHA activities was investigated using RXR and/or retinoic acid receptor (RAR) agonists to mimic DHA activities or a synthetic pan-RXR antagonist to block them. Involvement of RXR isotypes was analyzed using the same tasks and delayed nonmatch to place for working memory in RXRγ knockout mice. RESULTS: Docosahexaenoic acid decreased despair behavior and improved working memory in BALBcByJ mice. Such effects were suppressed by co-treatment with BR1211, a pan-RXR antagonist, whereas a pan-RXR agonist, UVI2108, mimicked DHA activities. Retinoic acid (RA), a natural ligand of RXRs, also reduced despair behavior and improved working memory and such activities did not require activation of RARs, as RA effects were abolished by co-treatment with BR1211 and they were not reproduced by TTNPB, a pan-RAR agonist. The RXRγ knockout mice displayed increased despair and deficits in working memory, which were insensitive to DHA and pan-RXR agonist treatments, whereas DHA or UVI2108 reversed these deficits in RXRγ heterozygous mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that RXRs are a converging point in mediating DHA and RA modulations of despair behavior and working memory and that RXRγ is the predominant RXR isotype in these regulations.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wietrzych-Schindler M ; Szyszka-Niagolov M ; Ohta K ; Endo Y ; Pérez E ; de Lera AR ; Chambon P ; Krezel W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.12.017 ","Keywords":"Analysis of Variance\r\nAnimals\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects/*physiology\r\nDepression/genetics/*metabolism\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/*pharmacology\r\nMemory, Short-Term/drug effects/*physiology\r\nMice\r\nMice, Knockout\r\nRetinoid X Receptor gamma/genetics/*metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wietrzych-Schindler M, Szyszka-Niagolov M, Ohta K, Endo Y, Pérez E, de Lera AR, Chambon P, and Krezel W (2011) Retinoid x receptor gamma is implicated in docosahexaenoic acid modulation of despair behaviors and working memory in mice..

Preliminary evidence supports a hypothesis that low plasma concentration of essential fatty acids is associated with depression. Reported here is the result of a systematic review examining the therapeutic efficacy of essential fatty acids for depression. METHODS: Data sources included Medline, Psychinfo, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine), and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register databases searched from inception through September 2001. English language randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, intervention studies, case control studies, reviews, and case reports of humans were selected, without limits for demographics or co-morbidities. Two abstractors independently evaluated each study, then reconciled findings. When possible, between group treatment effect size was noted or calculated. RESULTS: Six articles met inclusion criteria: one RCT, two reviews, and three case control trials. A common outcome measure among the case control trials allowed for direct comparison of effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence implies promise of a treatment effect of omega-3 fatty acids for depression in adults; although a statement of definitive clinical efficacy is premature.

Observational studies have found poor micronutrient status (particularly folate and vitamin B12) to be associated with an increased risk of depression in older people. Supplementation with folic acid has been shown to enhance anti-depressant drug treatment and there is preliminary evidence that supplementation with certain micronutrients may help improve depressive symptoms in older patients. There has also been a lot of interest in the role of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in depression.

METHODS: Two PubMed searches and a BIOSIS Preview, a Web of Science and a PsychInfo search were conducted with the search terms 'DHA, pregnancy and depression' and 'omega-3 fatty acids, pregnancy and depression'. RESULTS: Ten articles - three longitudinal cohort studies, five randomized controlled trials and two pilot trials- that met selection criteria were reviewed. Six found no association, two found mixed results, and two found a positive association between omega-3 PUFAs and reduced incidence of maternal perinatal depression. The heterogeneity of results can be explained by dissimilar study designs, including differences in study duration, time period of measurement and number of participants, and in varied dosages and types of supplemental PUFAs. Some of the larger studies and those that found a positive effect were more likely to be using higher doses, close to 2 g of docosahexaeonic acid (DHA) + eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and began the supplementation earlier in pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Future RCTs to investigate the role of PUFA supplementation and risk for maternal perinatal depression should begin supplementation early in pregnancy and use a dosage closer to 2 g of DHA + EPA. Depression should also be measured using a diagnostic interview schedule in addition to a screener.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wojcicki JM ; Heyman MB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3109/14767058.2010.521873 ","Keywords":"Depression, Postpartum/*prevention & control\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/*administration & dosage\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/*administration & dosage\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nPregnancy\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nRisk","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wojcicki JM, and Heyman MB (2011) Maternal omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and risk for perinatal maternal depression..

This review aims to determine the effect of n-3 PUFAs on depressive symptoms in people with or without diagnosed depression. Medline, PsycINFO, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the association between n-3 PUFAs and depressive symptoms or disorders as outcomes. A random-effects meta-analysis of standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was performed. Twenty-five studies (7682 participants) were included. Our meta-analysis (20 studies) indicated that n-3 PUFA supplementation lowered depressive symptomology as compared with placebo: SMD = -0.34, 95% CI: -0.55, -0.12, I(2) = 86%, n = 5836, but a possible publication bias cannot be ruled out. Subgroup analyses indicated no statistically significant difference by treatment duration of <12 vs. ≥12 weeks, presence of comorbidity, or severity of depressive symptoms. Nevertheless, beneficial effects were seen in the subgroups of studies with longer treatment duration and with no depression and mild to moderate depression. Subgroup analysis by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) dosage revealed differences in favor of the lower EPA dosage. Sensitivity analysis including studies with low risk of bias seems to confirm the overall result. Supplementation of n-3 PUFA appears to have a modest beneficial effect on depressive symptomology, although the quality of evidence is still insufficient.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wolters M ; von der Haar A; Baalmann AK ; Wellbrock M ; Heise TL ; Rach S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu13041070 ","Keywords":"Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy/*prevention & control\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\ndepression\r\ndepressive symptoms\r\ndocosahexaenoic acid\r\neicosapentaenoic acid\r\nmeta-analysis\r\nn-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wolters M, von der Haar A, Baalmann AK, Wellbrock M, Heise TL, and Rach S (2021) Effects of n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Supplementation in the Prevention and Treatment of Depressive Disorders-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis..

METHOD: Participants were children 5-12 years of age meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for bipolar spectrum disorders (bipolar I or II disorder or bipolar disorder not otherwise specified [NOS]) and displaying mixed, manic, or hypomanic symptoms. Subjects with severe illness were excluded. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: inositol plus placebo, omega-3 fatty acids plus placebo, and the combined active treatment of omega-3 fatty acids plus inositol. Data were collected from February 2012 to November 2013. RESULTS: Twenty-four subjects were exposed to treatment (≥ 1 week of study completed) (inositol [n = 7], omega-3 fatty acids [n = 7], and omega-3 fatty acids plus inositol [n =10]). Fifty-four percent of the subjects completed the study. Subjects randomized to the omega-3 fatty acids plus inositol arm had the largest score decrease comparing improvement from baseline to end point with respect to the Young Mania Rating Scale (P < .05). Similar results were found for the Children's Depression Rating Scale (P < .05) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (P <.05). CONCLUSION: Results of this pilot randomized, double-blind, controlled trial suggest that the combined treatment of omega-3 fatty acids plus inositol reduced symptoms of mania and depression in prepubertal children with mild to moderate bipolar spectrum disorders.

Its long-term use can cause neurobiological side-effects associated with depression. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs), the essential fatty acids found in fish oil, possess neuroprotecitve and antidepressant activities. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the potential protective effects of ω-3 PUFAs against DOX-induced behavioral changes and neurotoxicity. ω-3 PUFAs were given daily by gavage (1.5 g/kg) over three weeks starting seven days before DOX administration (2.5 mg/kg). Open-field test (OFT) and forced swimming test (FST) were conducted to assess exploratory activity and despair behavior, respectively. Our data showed that ω-3 PUFAs supplementation significantly mitigated the behavioral changes induced by DOX. ω-3 PUFAs pretreatment also alleviated the DOX-induced neural apoptosis. Meanwhile, ω-3 PUFAs treatment ameliorated DOX-induced oxidative stress in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Additionally, gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, and the protein levels of NF-κB and iNOS were significantly increased in brain tissues of DOX-treated group, whereas ω-3 PUFAs supplementation significantly attenuated DOX-induced neuroinflammation. In conclusion, ω-3 PUFAs can effectively protect against DOX-induced depressive-like behaviors, and the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect are potentially associated with its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wu YQ ; Dang RL ; Tang MM ; Cai HL ; Li HD ; Liao DH ; He X ; Cao LJ ; Xue Y ; Jiang P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu8040243 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nApoptosis/drug effects\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBiomarkers\r\nBrain/drug effects\r\nCentral Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced/drug therapy\r\nDepression/*chemically induced/drug therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nDoxorubicin/*toxicity\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nGene Expression Regulation/drug effects\r\nInflammation/chemically induced/drug therapy\r\nMale\r\nOxidative Stress\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSwimming\r\nWeight Gain\r\ndepression\r\ndoxorubicin\r\nneuroinflammation\r\nneurotoxicity\r\noxidative stress\r\nω-3 PUFAs","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wu YQ, Dang RL, Tang MM, Cai HL, Li HD, Liao DH, He X, Cao LJ, Xue Y, and Jiang P (2016) Long Chain Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Supplementation Alleviates Doxorubicin-Induced Depressive-Like Behaviors and Neurotoxicity in Rats: Involvement of Oxidative Stress and Neuroinflammation..

While the neuroinflammatory condition has been demonstrated in ovariectomized (OVX) rodents, there is limited evidence concerning microglial polarization, a key process in brain immune activation, in menopause-related brain. METHODS: Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the polarized microglia in long-term OVX rats and we further explored whether supplementation of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), the pleiotropic bioactive nutrient, is effective in the neurobehavioral changes caused by OVX. RESULTS: Our data showed that OVX-induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors in rats, accompanied with increased neural apoptosis and microglial activation in the hippocampus. Additionally, OVX enhanced proinflammatory cytokines expression and suppressed the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Correspondingly, OVX reinforced NFκB signaling and shifted the microglia from immunoregulatory M2 phenotype to proinflammatory M1 phenotype. Meanwhile, daily supplementation with PUFA suppressed microglial M1 polarization and potentiated M2 polarization in OVX rats.

In this study, a rat model of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) was adopted to mimic chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. A reduced sucrose preference ratio, increased immobility time in the tail suspension test and forced swim test, and compromised gut homeostasis were found. A promoted conversion of tryptophan (Trp) into kynurenine (Kyn) instead of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was observed in the hippocampus and gut of BCCAO rats. Meanwhile, 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing suggested a compromised profile of the gut SCFA-producing microbiome, with a decreased serum level of SCFAs revealed by targeted metabolomics analysis. With SCFA supplementation, BCCAO rats exhibited ameliorated depressive-like behaviors and improved gut dysbiosis, compared with the salt-matched BCCAO group. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and quantitative RT-PCR suggested that SCFA supplementation suppressed the conversion of Trp to Kyn and rescued the reduction in 5-HT levels in the hippocampus and gut. In addition to inhibiting the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, SCFA supplementation ameliorated the activated oxidative stress and reduced the number of microglia and the expression of its proinflammatory markers in the hippocampus post BCCAO. In conclusion, our data suggested the participation of the gut-brain axis in vascular depression, shedding light on the neuroprotective potential of treatment with gut-derived SCFAs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Xiao W ; Li J ; Gao X ; Yang H ; Su J ; Weng R ; Gao Y ; Ni W ; Gu Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.expneurol.2022.114225 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrain-Gut Axis\r\nCytokines/metabolism\r\nDepression/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nFatty Acids, Volatile\r\nKynurenine/metabolism\r\nRats\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nSucrose\r\n*Tryptophan/metabolism\r\n*Vascular Depression\r\nChronic cerebral hypoperfusion\r\nDepressive-like behaviors\r\nGut microbiome\r\nInflammation\r\nIntestinal motility\r\nShort-chain fatty acids\r\nTryptophan metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Xiao W, Li J, Gao X, Yang H, Su J, Weng R, Gao Y, Ni W, and Gu Y (2022) Involvement of the gut-brain axis in vascular depression via tryptophan metabolism: A benefit of short chain fatty acids..

Although DHA appears more effective for neuroinflammatory conditions, EPA is more beneficial for depression. However, the brain contains negligible amounts of EPA, and dietary supplements fail to increase it appreciably. We tested the hypothesis that this failure is due to absorption of EPA as triacylglycerol, whereas the transporter at the blood-brain barrier requires EPA as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). We compared tissue uptake in normal mice gavaged with equal amounts (3.3 μmol/day) of either LPC-EPA or free EPA (surrogate for current supplements) for 15 days and also measured target gene expression. Compared with the no-EPA control, LPC-EPA increased brain EPA >100-fold (from 0.03 to 4 μmol/g); free EPA had little effect. Furthermore, LPC-EPA, but not free EPA, increased brain DHA 2-fold. Free EPA increased EPA in adipose tissue, and both supplements increased EPA and DHA in the liver and heart. Only LPC-EPA increased EPA and DHA in the retina, and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, cyclic AMP response element binding protein, and 5-hydroxy tryptamine (serotonin) receptor 1A in the brain. These novel results show that brain EPA can be increased through diet. Because LPC-EPA increased both EPA and DHA in the brain, it may help in the treatment of depression as well as neuroinflammatory diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yalagala PCR ; Sugasini D ; Dasarathi S ; Pahan K ; Subbaiah PV ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1194/jlr.M090464 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrain/*drug effects/*metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\n*Diet\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/blood/*metabolism\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/blood/*metabolism\r\nGene Expression Regulation/drug effects\r\nLysophosphatidylcholines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nRetina/drug effects/metabolism\r\nAlzheimer’s disease\r\nblood-brain barrier\r\nbrain lipids\r\nbrain-derived neurotrophic factor\r\ndocosahexaenoic acid\r\neicosapentaenoic acid\r\nfish oil\r\ninflammation\r\nlysophospholipid\r\nnutrition/lipids\r\nomega 3 fatty acids\r\nretina","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yalagala PCR, Sugasini D, Dasarathi S, Pahan K, and Subbaiah PV (2019) Dietary lysophosphatidylcholine-EPA enriches both EPA and DHA in the brain: potential treatment for depression..

Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a ketone body and has recently been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome. Here, we investigated the potential antidepressant and anti-inflammatory effects of BHB on rats exposed to acute and chronic stress. We examined the influence of repeated BHB administration on depressive and anxiety behaviors in a rodent model of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Additionally, the influence of acute immobilization (IMM) stress and single BHB administration on hippocampal interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were assessed. Repeated administration of BHB attenuated CUS-induced depressive- and anxiety-related behaviors. IMM stress increased levels of IL-1β in the hippocampus, while a single pre-administration of BHB attenuated this increase. Although no effect was observed on hippocampal TNF-α levels after 1 h of IMM stress, a single BHB pre-administration reduced hippocampal TNF-α. Our previous report showed that the release of IL-1β and TNF-α caused by stress is tightly regulated by NLRP3 inflammasome. These findings demonstrate that BHB exerts antidepressant-like effects, possibly by inhibiting NLRP3-induced neuro-inflammation in the hippocampus, and that BHB may be a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of stress-related mood disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yamanashi T ; Iwata M ; Kamiya N ; Tsunetomi K ; Kajitani N ; Wada N ; Iitsuka T ; Yamauchi T ; Miura A ; Pu S ; Shirayama Y ; Watanabe K ; Duman RS ; Kaneko K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-017-08055-1 ","Keywords":"3-Hydroxybutyric Acid/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nAnimals\r\nAnxiety\r\nBehavior, Animal\r\nBiomarkers\r\nCytokines/metabolism\r\nDepression\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nInflammation/drug therapy/*etiology/*metabolism/psychology\r\nMale\r\nNLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors\r\nRats\r\n*Stress, Physiological\r\n*Stress, Psychological","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yamanashi T, Iwata M, Kamiya N, Tsunetomi K, Kajitani N, Wada N, Iitsuka T, Yamauchi T, Miura A, Pu S, Shirayama Y, Watanabe K, Duman RS, and Kaneko K (2017) Beta-hydroxybutyrate, an endogenic NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, attenuates stress-induced behavioral and inflammatory responses..

However, mechanism of lipid metabolism involved in the depressive attenuation remains poorly understood. Olfactory bulbectomy (OB)-induced changes in animal behavior and physiological functions are similar to those observed in depressed patients. Therefore, the present study used wild type (WT) and Fat-1 mice with or without OB to explore whether endogenous n-3 PUFA treatment of depression was through rectifying lipid metabolism, and to discover the possible lipid metabolic pathways. In WT mice, OB enhanced locomotor activity associated with up-regulation of lipid metabolites in the serum, such as phosphatidylcholines, L-a-glutamyl-L-Lysine and coproporphyrinogen III (Cop), which were involved in anti-inflammatory lipid metabolic pathways. OB also increased microglia activation marker CD11b and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus. In one of the lipid pathways, increased Cop was significantly correlated with the hyper-activity of the OB mice. These OB-induced changes were markedly attenuated by endogenous n-3 PUFAs in Fat-1 mice. Additionally, increased expressions of anti-inflammatory lipid genes, such as fatty acid desaturase (Fads) and phospholipase A2 group VI (Pla2g6), were found in the hippocampus of Fat-1 mice compared with WT mice. Furthermore, Cop administration increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide in a microglial cell line BV2. In conclusion, endogenous n-3 PUFAs in Fat-1 mice attenuated abnormal behavior in the depression model through restoration of lipid metabolism and suppression of inflammatory response.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yan L ; Gu MQ ; Yang ZY ; Xia J ; Li P ; Vasar E ; Tian L ; Song C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbi.2021.05.024 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nCytokines\r\nFatty Acid Desaturases/genetics\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated\r\nGroup VI Phospholipases A2\r\nHumans\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nMice, Transgenic\r\nMicroglia\r\nDepression\r\nFat-1 mice\r\nInflammation\r\nMetabolomics\r\nOlfactory bulbectomy\r\nn-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yan L, Gu MQ, Yang ZY, Xia J, Li P, Vasar E, Tian L, and Song C (2021) Endogenous n-3 PUFAs attenuated olfactory bulbectomy-induced behavioral and metabolomic abnormalities in Fat-1 mice..

METHODS: RCTs that compared the combination of DHA and EPA to placebo for short-course treatment of depression in women were systematically reviewed up to March 2015. Outcome measurement was the standardized difference in means in clinical measure of depression severity. Random effect model was performed. Meta-regression analysis was performed to assess the effects of baseline depression scores. RESULTS: Data were obtained from eight RCTs. In these RCTs, 182 patients received placebo and 185 patients received DHA and EPA. The pooled standardized difference in mean was 0.65 with 95% CI = [0.18, 1.12]. There was no relation between the efficacy and the baseline depression scores. The sensitivity analysis found that the combination of EPA and DHA as monotherapy yielded a standardized difference in means of 0.65 (95% CI =0.41, 0.90) without heterogeneity. DISCUSSION: These results indicate a beneficial effect of the combination of EPA and DHA on depressed mood in women compared with placebo.

Eighty-five participants completed the trial, and their clinical remission and plasma PUFA-derived EC levels (pmol/mL) were measured. RESULTS: The cumulative rates of clinical remission were significantly higher in the EPA and EPA + DHA groups than the DHA group (51.85 and 53.84 vs. 34.37%; p =0.027 and p =0.024, respectively). EPA and EPA + DHA treatments increased the eicosapentaenoylethanolamide (EPEA) levels compared to DHA treatment (0.33 ± 0.18 and 0.35 ± 0.24 vs. 0.08 ± 0.12; p =0.002 and p =0.001, respectively), while EPA + DHA treatment increased the docosahexaenoylethanolamide levels more than EPA treatment (1.34 ± 2.09 vs. 0.01 ± 1.79; p =0.006). Plasma EPEA levels were positively correlated with rates of clinical remission (hazard ratio: 1.60, 95% confidence interval: 1.08-2.39). CONCLUSIONS: Treatments enriched with EPA increased plasma EPEA levels, which was positively associated with clinical remission. This finding may suggest that levels of plasma EPEA play a potential novel endogenous therapeutic target in MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yang B ; Lin L ; Bazinet RP ; Chien YC ; Chang JP ; Satyanarayanan SK ; Su H ; Su KP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000501158 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nArachidonic Acids/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*blood/*drug therapy\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nEndocannabinoids/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nDocosahexaenoic acid\r\nEicosapentaenoic acid\r\nEndocannabinoids\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nω–3 polyunsaturated fatty acid","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yang B, Lin L, Bazinet RP, Chien YC, Chang JP, Satyanarayanan SK, Su H, and Su KP (2019) Clinical Efficacy and Biological Regulations of ω-3 PUFA-Derived Endocannabinoids in Major Depressive Disorder..

This study aimed to investigate the effects of unpredictable chronic mild stress (CUMS) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) on central nervous system. The depressive-like behaviors induced by CUMS were assessed by sucrose preference test (SPT), open field test (OFT) and forced swimming test (FST). High-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was used to quantify the levels of neurotransmitters and their metabolites involved in serotonergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic, GABAergic neurotransmitter systems in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Repeated CUMS caused depressive-like behaviors of rats, associated with the alteration of neurotransmitters in brain, including the decreasing DA level, the increasing NE and GABA level, and the increasing 5-HT turnover rate in hippocampus, which could be partly alleviated by sufficient n-3 PUFAs supplementation. The influence of stress and diet on neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortex was slight. However, it was obvious that supplementary of n-3 PUFAs relieved the decreasing DA/NE between-metabolite ratio 1,2 and DA/5-HT between-metabolite ratio 1,2 in the prefrontal cortex caused by CUMS. Altered neurotransmitter turnover rates and between-metabolite ratios in brain may be better predictors in depression and antidepressant treatment compared with monoamine neurotransmitters.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yang R ; Zhang MQ ; Xue Y ; Yang R ; Tang MM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2019.112172 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nDepression/diet therapy/*metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage\r\nFemale\r\nMaternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nNeurotransmitter Agents/*metabolism\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/metabolism\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nStress, Psychological/diet therapy/*metabolism\r\nUncertainty\r\nBehaviors\r\nBetween-metabolite ratio\r\nCUMS\r\nDepression\r\nTurnover rate\r\nn-3 PUFAs","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yang R, Zhang MQ, Xue Y, Yang R, and Tang MM (2019) Dietary of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids influence neurotransmitter systems of rats exposed to unpredictable chronic mild stress..

The strength of safety, well-acceptance, and accumulating scientific evidence has now afforded nutritional medicine a place in the mainstream of neuropsychiatric intervention and prophylaxis. Long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 or n-3 PUFAs) might have favorable effects on immunity, inflammation, oxidative stress and psychoneuroimmunity at different stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Omega-3 PUFAs, particularly EPA, have shown effects in treating mood and neurocognitive disorders by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, altering the HPA axis, and modulating neurotransmission via lipid rafts. In addition, omega-3 PUFAs and their metabolites, including specialized pro-resolvin mediators, accelerate the process of cleansing chronic inflammation and restoring tissue homeostasis, and therefore offer a promising strategy for Long COVID. In this article, we explore in a systematic review the putative molecular mechanisms by which omega-3 PUFAs and their metabolites counteract the negative effects of long COVID on the brain, behavior, and immunity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yang CP ; Chang CM ; Yang CC ; Pariante CM ; Su KP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbi.2022.04.001 ","Keywords":"*COVID-19/complications\r\nFatty Acids\r\n*Fatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System\r\nInflammation/drug therapy\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System\r\nSARS-CoV-2\r\nPost-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome\r\nCognition\r\nDepression\r\nImmunity\r\nInflammation\r\nLong COVID\r\nMood\r\nOmega-3 PUFAs\r\nSickness","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yang CP, Chang CM, Yang CC, Pariante CM, and Su KP (2022) Long COVID and long chain fatty acids (LCFAs): Psychoneuroimmunity implication of omega-3 LCFAs in delayed consequences of COVID-19..

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of n-3 PUFAs plus venlafaxine in patients with first-diagnosed, drug-naïve depression. METHOD: A total of 72 outpatients with first-diagnosed depression were recruited. The daily dose of 2.4 g/day n-3 PUFAs or placebo plus venlafaxine was used for over 12 weeks. The outcomes were assessed by the Hamilton depression scale (HAMD), Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA), Beck depression inventory (BDI), and Self-rating anxiety scale (SAS). RESULTS: Both groups exhibited improvement on clinical characteristics at week 4 and week 12 compared with baseline. The rate of responders for anxiety in n-3 PUFAs group (44.44%) was significantly higher than that in placebo group (21.21%) at week 4 (χ(2) = 4.182, p = 0.041), while week 12 did not show a difference (χ(2) = 0.900, p = 0.343). The rate of responders for depression at both week 4 (χ(2) = 0.261, p = 0.609) and week 12 (χ(2) = 1.443, p = 0.230) showed no significant difference between two groups. Further analysis found that Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) had positive correlation with HAMA (r = 0.301, p = 0.012), SAS (r = 0.246, p = 0.015), HAMD (r = 0.252, p = 0.038) and BDI (r = 0.233, p = 0.022) with Pearson correlation analysis. Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) had negative correlation with SAS (r = -0.244, p = 0.015) and BDI (r = -0.365, p = 0.000). CONCLUSION: This trial found that n-3 PUFAs supplementation in favor of venlafaxine alleviated the anxiety symptoms rather than depressive symptoms at the early stage of treatment (4 weeks) for first-diagnosed, drug-naïve depressed patients. However, the advantage disappeared in long-term treatment. Furthermore, childhood abuse and social support are closely related to the clinical and biological characteristics of depression. Both childhood trauma and lack of social support might be predictors of poor prognosis in depression.

It has been reported that up to 40% of university students experience levels of depression. Several negative consequences are associated with depression symptoms, such as memory impairment, suicide, and substance abuse. Recently, researchers have been studying possible associations between depression and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which may modify depression symptoms. The aim of the present study was to find an association between PUFA levels and depression among Iranian postgraduate students in Malaysia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2011 with 402 Iranian postgraduate students who were studying in Malaysia. The participants included 173 (43%) women and 229 (57%) men, and the mean age of the participants was 32.54 ± 6.22 years. RESULTS: After adjustment for several potential confounders including sex, age, BMI, PUFAs, MUFAs, and SFAs, monthly expenses, close friends, living in campus, smoking, education, and marital status in a logistic regression model, an inverse relationship was found between depression symptoms and the dietary intake of PUFAs. CONCLUSION: We found an inverse association between PUFA intake and depression symptoms in Iranian postgraduate students in Malaysia. We, therefore, concluded that long-term intake of PUFAs may modify or prevent depression symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yary T ; Aazami S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1476-511X-10-151 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/*ethnology/metabolism\r\nDietary Fats/*metabolism\r\nEating\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/*metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIran/ethnology\r\nLogistic Models\r\nMalaysia/epidemiology\r\nMale\r\nStudents","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yary T, and Aazami S (2011) The association between polyunsaturated fatty acids and depression among Iranian postgraduate students in Malaysia..

A previous study of the authors demonstrated that essential oil of Perilla frutescens (EOPF) attenuated the depressive-like behavior in mice. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was undertaken to explore the dynamic change of behaviors and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), and improved by EOPF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four separate CUMS experimental groups (1-week, 2-week, 3-week and 4-week treatment) were treated with EOPF (3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, p.o.) or fluoxetine (20 mg/kg, p.o.), followed by sucrose preference, locomotor activity, immobility and hippocampal BDNF measurement. RESULTS: EOPF, as well as fluoxetine, restored the CUMS-induced decreased sucrose preference and increased immobility time, without affecting body weight gain and locomotor activity. Furthermore, CUMS (3 or 4-week) produced a reduction in both BDNF mRNA and protein expression in the hippocampus, which were ameliorated by EOPF (4-week) and fluoxetine (3 or 4-week) treatment. CONCLUSION: These results presented here show that BDNF is expressed depending on length of CUMS procedure and EOPF administration. And this study might contribute to the underlying reason for the slow onset of antidepressant activity in clinic.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yi LT ; Li J ; Geng D ; Liu BB ; Fu Y ; Tu JQ ; Liu Y ; Weng LJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jep.2013.03.015 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBody Weight/drug effects\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/*metabolism\r\nChronic Disease\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDown-Regulation\r\nDrugs, Chinese Herbal/isolation & purification/*pharmacology\r\nFluoxetine/pharmacology\r\nFood Preferences/drug effects\r\nHippocampus/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMedicine, Chinese Traditional\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred ICR\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nOils, Volatile/isolation & purification/*pharmacology\r\n*Perilla frutescens/chemistry\r\nPhytotherapy\r\nPlant Leaves\r\nPlant Oils/isolation & purification/pharmacology\r\nPlants, Medicinal\r\nRNA, Messenger/metabolism\r\nStress, Psychological/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/psychology\r\nSucrose\r\nTime Factors\r\nalpha-Linolenic Acid/isolation & purification/*pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yi LT, Li J, Geng D, Liu BB, Fu Y, Tu JQ, Liu Y, and Weng LJ (2013) Essential oil of Perilla frutescens-induced change in hippocampal expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in chronic unpredictable mild stress in mice..

METHODS: The review was conducted among five electronic databases to identify all peer-reviewed journal papers that tested the effects of aromatherapy in the form of therapeutic massage for patients with depressive symptoms. RESULTS: The results were based on six studies examining the effects of aromatherapy on depressive symptoms in patients with depression and cancer. Some studies showed positive effects of this intervention among these three groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that aromatherapy could continue to be used as a complementary and alternative therapy for patients with depression and secondary depressive symptoms arising from various types of chronic medical conditions. More controlled studies with sound methodology should be conducted in the future to ascertain its clinical effects and the underlying psychobiologic mechanisms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yim VW ; Ng AK ; Tsang HW ; Leung AY ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1089/acm.2008.0333 ","Keywords":"*Aromatherapy\r\nDepression/complications/*therapy\r\nHumans\r\nNeoplasms/psychology\r\nOils, Volatile/*therapeutic use\r\nPlant Extracts/*therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yim VW, Ng AK, Tsang HW, and Leung AY (2009) A review on the effects of aromatherapy for patients with depressive symptoms..

Increasing resilience, the ability to cope with stress in the face of adversity, is considered an important strategy to prevent depression. It has been suggested that consumption of fish, which is a major source of long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA), may prevent depression. However, associations between depression, resilience, and fish consumption have not been documented. The aim of the study is to investigate the association between fish consumption and resilience to depression. METHODS: Participants were 527 Japanese employees at three worksites of a large company. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale was administered to assess depressive symptoms, and the 14-item Resilience Scale (RS-14) was administered to assess resilience. A self-report questionnaire extracted from the Food Frequency Questionnaire was used to measure fish consumption frequency. Regression analyses were conducted to assess a mediation model based on a statistical analysis framework defined by Baron and Kenny. The indirect association of resilience was calculated with the bootstrapping method. Each analysis was adjusted by age, sex, marital status, work position, and educational background. RESULTS: The association between fish consumption frequency and total CES-D score was significant (B=-0.94; p=0.011). The association between fish consumption frequency and total RS-14 score was significant (B=1.4; p=0.010), as was association total RS-14 score and the total CES-D score (B=-0.34; p<0.001). When controlling for total RS-14 score, there was no longer a significant association between fish consumption frequency and total CES-D score. The bootstrapping results revealed that significant indirect association though fish consumption frequency and total CES-D score (bias corrected and accelerated confidence interval=-0.83 to -0.13; 95% confidence interval) through total RS-14 score. CONCLUSIONS: Fish consumption might be associated with resilience to depression. Further studies are needed, particularly double blind randomized placebo controlled intervention trials on the potential preventative effect of LC n-3 PUFA on resilience to depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yoshikawa E ; Nishi D ; Matsuoka Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12944-015-0048-8 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnimals\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/*prevention & control\r\n*Diet\r\nFemale\r\n*Fishes\r\nHumans\r\nJapan\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nPsychological Tests\r\n*Resilience, Psychological\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yoshikawa E, Nishi D, and Matsuoka Y (2015) Fish consumption and resilience to depression in Japanese company workers: a cross-sectional study..

As evidence, decreased blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids have been associated with several neuropsychiatric conditions, including Attention Deficit (Hyperactivity) Disorder, Alzheimer's Disease, Schizophrenia and Depression. Supplementation studies, using individual or combination omega-3 fatty acids, suggest the possibility for decreased symptoms associated with some of these conditions. Thus far, however, the benefits of supplementation, in terms of decreasing disease risk and/or aiding in symptom management, are not clear and more research is needed. The reasons for blood fatty acid alterations in these disorders are not known, nor are the potential mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids may function in normal neuronal activity and neuropsychiatric disease prevention and/or treatment. It is clear, however, that DHA is the predominant n-3 fatty acid found in the brain and that EPA plays an important role as an anti-inflammatory precursor. Both DHA and EPA can be linked with many aspects of neural function, including neurotransmission, membrane fluidity, ion channel and enzyme regulation and gene expression. This review summarizes the knowledge in terms of dietary omega-3 fatty acid intake and metabolism, as well as evidence pointing to potential mechanisms of omega-3 fatty acids in normal brain functioning, development of neuropsychiatric disorders and efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in terms of symptom management.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Young G ; Conquer J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1051/rnd:2005001 ","Keywords":"Alzheimer Disease/metabolism/prevention & control\r\nAttention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/metabolism/prevention & control\r\nAutistic Disorder/metabolism/prevention & control\r\nBrain/*metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/metabolism/prevention & control\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage/blood/*physiology\r\nHumans\r\nMental Disorders/metabolism/*prevention & control\r\nSchizophrenia/metabolism/prevention & control","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Young G, and Conquer J (2005) Omega-3 fatty acids and neuropsychiatric disorders..

COPD is often comorbid with mood disorders; however, they are frequently neglected or undiagnosed in COPD management, thus resulting in unintended treatment outcomes and higher mortality associated with the disease. Although the exact link between COPD and mood disorders remains to be ascertained, there is a broader opinion that inflammatory reactions in the lungs, blood, and inflammation-induced changes in the brain could orchestrate the onset of mood disorders in COPD. Although the current management of mood disorders such as depression in COPD involves using antidepressants, their use has been limited due to tolerability issues. On the other hand, as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) play a vital role in regulating inflammatory responses, they could be promising alternatives in managing mood disorders in COPD. This review discusses comorbid mood disorders in COPD as well as their influence on the progression and management of COPD. The underlying mechanisms of comorbid mood disorders in COPD will also be discussed, along with the potential role of n-3 PUFAs in managing these conditions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zailani H ; Satyanarayanan SK ; Liao WC ; Liao HF ; Huang SY ; Gałecki P ; Su KP ; Chang JP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/jcm12072653 ","Keywords":"anxiety\r\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease\r\ndepression\r\ninflammation\r\nomega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids\r\noxidative stress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zailani H, Satyanarayanan SK, Liao WC, Liao HF, Huang SY, Gałecki P, Su KP, and Chang JP (2023) Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Managing Comorbid Mood Disorders in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): A Review..

Among potential candidates, arachidonyl-2'-chloroethylamide (ACEA), a selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist is proposed. The aim of this paper was to determine if ACEA, a selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist, could reverse the effects of corticosterone (CORT), characteristic of depressive and bladder overactivity potential. The animals (48 female rats) were divided into four groups: I-control, II-received CORT, III-received ACEA, and IV-received the combination of CORT and ACEA. The conscious cystometry, forced swim test (FST), and locomotor activity measurements were performed 3 days after the last dose of ACEA, followed by ELISA measurements. In group IV, ACEA restored urodynamic parameters that were altered by CORT. CORT prolonged the immobility time in FST and the values were lowered by ACEA. ACEA normalized the expression of c-Fos in all the analyzed central micturition centers (group IV vs. group II). ACEA restored the CORT-induced changes in the biomarkers in urine (BDNF, NGF), bladder detrusor (VAChT, Rho kinase), bladder urothelium (CGRP, ATP, CRF, OCT-3, TRPV1), and hippocampus (TNF-α, IL-1β and Il-6, CRF, IL-10, BDNF, NGF). In conclusion, ACEA was proven to reverse CORT-induced changes in both cystometric and biochemical parameters that are determinants of OAB/depression, which represents an example of an existing link between OAB and depression via cannabinoid receptors.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zapała Ł ; Niemczyk G ; Zapała P ; Wdowiak A ; Bojar I ; Kluz T ; Szopa A ; Serefko A ; Radziszewski P ; Wróbel A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ijms24043820 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nFemale\r\nRats\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/therapeutic use\r\n*Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\n*Cannabinoids/therapeutic use\r\nCorticosterone\r\nLigands\r\nRats, Wistar\r\n*Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1/agonists\r\n*Urinary Bladder, Overactive/drug therapy\r\n*Arachidonic Acids/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nACEA\r\ncannabinoid receptors\r\ncannabinoids\r\noveractive bladder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zapała Ł, Niemczyk G, Zapała P, Wdowiak A, Bojar I, Kluz T, Szopa A, Serefko A, Radziszewski P, and Wróbel A (2023) The Cannabinoid Ligand Arachidonyl-2'-Chloroethylamide (ACEA) Ameliorates Depressive and Overactive Bladder Symptoms in a Corticosterone-Induced Female Wistar Rat Model..

Evidence strongly suggests that nutrition might exert a significant impact on the onset, the duration and the severity of major depression. Accordingly, preclinical and clinical investigations demonstrated the beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids in anxiety and mood disorders. Although the neurobiological substrates of its action remain poorly documented, basic research has shown that omega-3 increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in brain regions associated with depression, as antidepressant drugs do. In contrast, low BDNF levels and hippocampal atrophy were observed in animal models of depression. In this context, the present study compared the effects of long-lasting fish oil-enriched diet, an important source of omega-3 fatty acids, between heterozygous BDNF(+/-) mice and their wild-type littermates. Our results demonstrated lower activation of Erk in BDNF(+/-) mice whereas this deficit was rescued by fish oil-enriched diet. In parallel, BDNF(+/-) mice displayed elevated hippocampal extracellular 5-HT levels in relation with a local decreased serotonin transporter protein level. Fish oil-enriched diet restored normal serotonergic tone by increasing the protein levels of serotonin transporter. At the cellular level, fish oil-enriched diet increased the pool of immature neurons in the dentate gyrus of BDNF(+/-) mice and the latter observations coincide with its ability to promote anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like response in these mutants. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the beneficial effects of long-term exposure to fish oil-enriched diet in behavioral paradigms known to recapitulate diverse abnormalities related to the depressive state specifically in mice with a partial loss of BDNF. These findings contrast with the mechanism of action of currently available antidepressant drugs for which the full manifestation of their therapeutic activity depends on the enhancement of serotoninergic and BDNF signaling. Further studies are warranted to determine whether fish oil supplementation could be used as an add-on strategy to conventional pharmacological interventions in treatment-resistant patients and relevant animal models.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zemdegs J ; Rainer Q ; Grossmann CP ; Rousseau-Ralliard D ; Grynberg A ; Ribeiro E ; Guiard BP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fnins.2018.00974 ","Keywords":"antidepressant\r\nanxiolytic fish oil (n-3) fatty acids\r\nbrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)\r\nneurobehavior\r\nserotonin","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zemdegs J, Rainer Q, Grossmann CP, Rousseau-Ralliard D, Grynberg A, Ribeiro E, and Guiard BP (2018) Anxiolytic- and Antidepressant-Like Effects of Fish Oil-Enriched Diet in Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Deficient Mice..

With the development of society, the increase of pressure and the role of various other factors make the incidence of depression increase year by year. However, there is a lack of drugs that have a fast onset, significant effects, and few side effects. Some volatile oils from traditional natural herbal medicines are usually used to relieve depression and calm emotions, such as Lavender essential oil and Acorus tatarinowii essential oil. It was reported that these volatile oils, are easy to enter the brain through the blood-brain barrier and have good antidepressant effects with little toxicity and side effects. In this review, we summarized the classification of depression, and listed the history of using volatile oils to fight depression in some countries. Importantly, we summarized the anti-depressant natural volatile oils and their monomers from herbal medicine, discussed the anti-depressive mechanisms of the volatile oils from natural medicine.

It is commonly used for the treatment of depression-related syndromes in China. In the formula, Radix Bupleuri usually serves as the principal drug, Radix Angelicae Sinensis and Radix Paeoniae Alba serve as the ministerial drugs, Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae, Poria, Herba Menthae and Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens serve as adjunctive drugs, Radix Glycyrrhizae serves as messenger drug, they coordinate with each other and enhance the effect of the formula. In our previous experiments, the antidepressant effect of XYS was revealed. However, the antidepressant part (or component) of this prescription was still obscure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An experimental despair animal model: the mice tail suspension test (TST) was used to evaluate the antidepressant activity of XYS and its fractions. GC-MS method was developed to identify the volatile components and determine 4 major volatile components in active fraction. RESULTS: In the TST test, the effect of a low polar fraction (XY-EA) was superior to other fractions of XYS. 13 volatile compounds in the XY-EA were identified on the basis of standards, isolation and structural determination in our laboratory, NIST 05 database and literature data. The content of 4 major volatile compounds in XY-EA which is 6.703%. CONCLUSIONS: The petroleum ether fraction (XY-EA) appears to be the active fraction of XYS. 4 major components Z-ligustilide, palmitic acid, atractylenolide I, and atractylenolide II may be the antidepressant active compounds.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zhou Y ; Ren Y ; Ma Z ; Jia G ; Gao X ; Zhang L ; Qin X ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jep.2012.02.018 ","Keywords":"4-Butyrolactone/analogs & derivatives/analysis/pharmacology\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDrugs, Chinese Herbal/*chemistry/*pharmacology\r\n*Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry\r\nLactones/analysis/pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred ICR\r\nMolecular Structure\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nPalmitic Acid/analysis/pharmacology\r\nPhytotherapy\r\nPlants, Medicinal\r\nSesquiterpenes/analysis/pharmacology\r\nVolatilization","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zhou Y, Ren Y, Ma Z, Jia G, Gao X, Zhang L, and Qin X (2012) Identification and quantification of the major volatile constituents in antidepressant active fraction of xiaoyaosan by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry..

Although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear, accumulated evidence indicates that omega-3 PUFAs can exhibit pleiotropic effects on the neural structure and function. Thus, they play fundamental roles in brain activities involved in the mood regulation. Since depressive symptoms have been assumed to be of central origin, this review aims to summarize the recently published studies to identify the potential neurobiological mechanisms underlying the anti-depressant effects of omega-3 PUFAs. These include that of (1) anti-neuroinflammatory; (2) hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; (3) anti-oxidative stress; (4) anti-neurodegeneration; (5) neuroplasticity and synaptic plasticity; and (6) modulation of neurotransmitter systems. Despite many lines of evidence have hinted that these mechanisms may co-exist and work in concert to produce anti-depressive effects, the potentially multiple sites of action of omega-3 PUFAs need to be fully established. We also discussed the limitations of current studies and suggest future directions for preclinical and translational research in this field.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zhou L ; Xiong JY ; Chai YQ ; Huang L ; Tang ZY ; Zhang XF ; Liu B ; Zhang JT ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyt.2022.933704 ","Keywords":"HPA axis\r\ndepression\r\nneurodegeneration\r\nneuroinflammation\r\nneuroplasticity\r\nneurotransmitter systems\r\nomega-3 PUFAs\r\nsynaptic plasticity","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zhou L, Xiong JY, Chai YQ, Huang L, Tang ZY, Zhang XF, Liu B, and Zhang JT (2022) Possible antidepressant mechanisms of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids acting on the central nervous system..

Evidence suggest that there is a two-way relationship between depression and CVD. Inflammation is implicated in the pathophysiology of both conditions, thus representing a central candidate mediating the link between these disorders. Depression is consistently associated with increased inflammation and increased blood levels of inflammatory molecules. In recent years, studies have shown that depression significantly increases the risk of developing inflammatory-related diseases such as CVD, precipitated by the same inflammatory pathways involved in the pathophysiology of CVD. OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: The aim of this work is to discuss the role of inflammation in depression and CVD and review the evidence of the benefits and side effects of anti-inflammatory drugs in both the diseases. RESULTS: Drugs with anti-inflammatory properties have shown benefit in alleviating signs and symptoms in CVD and in depression. This was shown to be particularly true for the following classes of drugs: non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) statins and cytokine inhibitors. Finally, antidepressant drugs initially used exclusively to treat depression also lead to improvement in CVD indicators, while lowering inflammation markers in patients at the same time. This evidence further strengthens the suggestion of the biological link between depression and CVD through inflammation. CONCLUSION: Strategies that can mitigate this risk profile are highly needed in the clinical setting, and these particular groups of drugs have the possibility of becoming increasingly important in treatment strategies aiming to improve both the conditions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zuzarte P ; Duong A ; Figueira ML ; Costa-Vitali A ; Scola G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1389200219666180305143501 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nCardiovascular Diseases/*drug therapy/epidemiology/immunology\r\nCytokines/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/epidemiology/immunology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination/methods\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nHydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nInflammation/*drug therapy/immunology\r\nPrevalence\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nInflammation\r\nNSAIDS\r\nPUFAs\r\nantidepressants\r\ncardiovascular disease\r\ndepression\r\nstatins.","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zuzarte P, Duong A, Figueira ML, Costa-Vitali A, and Scola G (2018) Current Therapeutic Approaches for Targeting Inflammation in Depression and Cardiovascular Disease..
