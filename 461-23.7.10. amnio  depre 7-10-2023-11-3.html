However, there remains controversies over the best possible treatment. The aim of this study is to compare Levodopa monotherapy versus Pramipexole in combination with Levodopa L in patients with PD with regards to the efficacy and side effects. METHODS: Patients being treated with levodopa alone and Pramipexole add-on therapy to Levodopa were enrolled in the study. Factors regarding efficacy and side effects were assessed and analyzed between both groups by appropriate tests. RESULTS: 176 Patients were enrolled in the study. Results showed significant higher total MDS-UPDRS (worse total disease severity score) among patients being treated with Pramipexole add-on therapy which was particularly higher in parts 1 (Mentation, behavior and mood), 2 (Activity of daily living) and 3 (Motor examination) (P-values < 0.05). Psychosis global score with significantly higher frequency of hallucination and depression, statistically higher in combination therapy group compared to Levodopa monotherapy group (P-value < 0.05). Patients in the Pramipexole add-on group reported lower scores of Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (P-value < 0.05). Significant correlation was between disease duration and psychosis score among Levodopa monotherapy group (P-value < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to Levodopa monotherapy, Add-on therapy with Pramipexole shows less efficiency yet more side effects. This indicates that single administration of Levodopa still remains the best available treatment for Parkinson's disease.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Abbasi MH ; Esmaeili S ; Habibi SA ; Shahidi GA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jocn.2020.06.024 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAntiparkinson Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nBenzothiazoles/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/epidemiology/etiology\r\nDrug Combinations\r\nFemale\r\nHallucinations/*epidemiology/etiology\r\nHumans\r\nLevodopa/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMovement\r\nParkinson Disease/*drug therapy\r\nPramipexole/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nPsychotic Disorders/*epidemiology/etiology\r\nQuality of Life\r\nHRQoL\r\nHallucination\r\nLevodopa\r\nParkinson\r\nPramipexole\r\nPsychosis\r\nUnified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Abbasi MH, Esmaeili S, Habibi SA, and Shahidi GA (2020) Dilemma in Parkinson's Treatment; Levodopa Monotherapy May be the Best Choice..

Mental depression is a common disorder that affects most individuals at one time or another. During depression, there are changes in mood and behavior, accompanied by feelings of defeat, hopelessness, or even suicidal thoughts. Depression has a direct or indirect relation with a number of other diseases including Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. In addition, antidepressant drugs have several side effects including sedation, increased weight, indigestion, sexual dysfunction, or a decrease in blood pressure. Stopping medication may cause a relapse of the symptoms of depression and pose a risk of attempted suicide. The pandemic of COVID-19 has affected the mental health of individuals, including patients, individuals contacting patients and medical staff with a number of mental disorders that may adversely affect the immune ability of their bodies. Some of the drugs currently included in the protocols for treating COVID-19 may negatively affect the mental health of patients. Evidence accumulated over the years indicates that serotonin (5HT) deficiencies and norepinephrine (NE) in the brain can lead to mental depression. Drugs that increase levels of NE and 5HT are commonly used in the treatment of depression. The common reason for mood disorders, including mania and bipolar disease are not clearly understood. It is assumed that hyperactivity in specific parts of the brain and excessive activity of neurotransmitters may be involved. Early diagnosis and developing new treatment strategies are essential for the prevention of the severe consequences of depression. In addition, extensive research should be directed towards the investigation of the mental health disturbances occurring during and/or after COVID-19 infection. This may lead to the incorporation of a suitable antidepressant into the current treatment protocols.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Abdel-Bakky MS ; Amin E ; Faris TM ; Abdellatif AAH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3892/mmr.2021.12479 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nCOVID-19/complications/*epidemiology/*psychology\r\nCytokine Release Syndrome/etiology\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/*epidemiology/etiology/metabolism\r\nGlutamic Acid/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nOxidative Stress\r\nCOVID-19\r\nlatest treatments\r\nmajor depression\r\nmental health\r\nmolecular mechanism\r\nneurotransmitters","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Abdel-Bakky MS, Amin E, Faris TM, and Abdellatif AAH (2021) Mental depression: Relation to different disease status, newer treatments and its association with COVID-19 pandemic (Review)..

Preliminary evidence suggests that creatine, an ergogenic compound known to promote cell survival and influence the production and usage of energy in the brain, can improve mood in treatment-resistant patients. This study examined the effects of chronic creatine supplementation using the forced swim test (FST), an animal model selectively sensitive to antidepressants with clinical efficacy in human beings. Thirty male (experiment 1) and 36 female (experiment 2) Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained on either chow alone or chow blended with either 2% w/w creatine monohydrate or 4% w/w creatine monohydrate for 5 weeks before the FST. Open field exploration and wire suspension tests were used to rule out general psychostimulant effects. Male rats maintained on 4% creatine displayed increased immobility in the FST as compared with controls with no differences by diet in the open field test, whereas female rats maintained on 4% creatine displayed decreased immobility in the FST and less anxiety in the open field test compared with controls. Open field and wire suspension tests confirmed that creatine supplementation did not produce differences in physical ability or motor function. The present findings suggest that creatine supplementation alters depression-like behavior in the FST in a sex-dependent manner in rodents, with female rats displaying an antidepressant-like response. Although the mechanisms of action are unclear, sex differences in creatine metabolism and the hormonal milieu are likely involved.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Allen PJ ; D'Anci KE ; Kanarek RB ; Renshaw PF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/npp.2009.160 ","Keywords":"Analysis of Variance\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology\r\nBody Temperature/drug effects/physiology\r\nCreatine/*administration & dosage/pharmacology\r\nDepression/*diet therapy/physiopathology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nExploratory Behavior/drug effects/physiology\r\nFemale\r\nImmobility Response, Tonic/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nPsychomotor Performance/drug effects/physiology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nReaction Time/drug effects\r\n*Sex Characteristics\r\nSwimming","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Allen PJ, D'Anci KE, Kanarek RB, and Renshaw PF (2010) Chronic creatine supplementation alters depression-like behavior in rodents in a sex-dependent manner..

Growing evidence is demonstrating the benefit of oral creatine supplements for reducing depressive symptoms in humans and animals. A novel question is whether dietary creatine, when combined with antidepressant drug therapy, would be more effective than either compound alone. To answer this question, four studies were conducted to investigate the behavioral effects of combined creatine and low-dose fluoxetine treatment using the forced swim test in male and female rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed powdered rodent chow supplemented with 0%, 2% or 4% w/w creatine monohydrate for 5 weeks. Rats were injected with fluoxetine (5.0 or 10.0 mg/kg) or saline according to a sub-acute dosing schedule. Female rats maintained on a 4% creatine diet displayed antidepressant-like effects compared to non-supplemented females prior to fluoxetine treatment. In contrast, creatine did not alter behavior reliably in males. Following drug treatment and a second forced swim trial, the antidepressant-like profile of creatine remained significant only in females co-administered 5.0 mg/kg fluoxetine. Moreover, in females only, supplementation with 4% creatine produced a more robust antidepressant-like behavioral profile compared to either dose of fluoxetine alone. Estrous cycle data indicated that ovarian hormones influenced the antidepressant-like effects of creatine. Addressing the issue of sex differences in response to treatment may affect our understanding of creatine, its relationship with depressive behavior, and may lead to sex-specific therapeutic strategies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Allen PJ ; D'Anci KE ; Kanarek RB ; Renshaw PF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pbb.2012.03.005 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBrain/drug effects/metabolism\r\nCreatine/*administration & dosage\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nEstrus/physiology\r\nFemale\r\nFluoxetine/*administration & dosage\r\nMale\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/administration & dosage\r\nSex Characteristics","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Allen PJ, D'Anci KE, Kanarek RB, and Renshaw PF (2012) Sex-specific antidepressant effects of dietary creatine with and without sub-acute fluoxetine in rats..

METHODS: The study was a randomized, parallel-group, controlled, clinical trial (NCT02099890) whereby 20 participants with varying levels and severities of SCI were randomized (3:2) to either the treatment group, consisting of a 12-week anti-inflammatory diet, or control group. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, 1 and 3 months, and consisted of CES-D scores of depression, markers of inflammation as assessed by various pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and several amino acids related to depression. RESULTS: A significant group × time interaction was found for CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic studies Depression Scale) score (p = 0.01), the TRP/LNAA (tryptophan/large neutral amino acid) ratio (p = 0.04), the composite score of pro-inflammatory cytokines (p = 0.04), IL-1β (interleukin-1 beta) (p = 0.04), and IFN-γ (interferon gamma) (p = 0.03). Pearson's r correlation showed significance between the ∆IL-1β and both the ∆CES-D score (r = 0.740, p < 0.01) and the ∆KYN/TRP (kynurenine/tryptophan) ratio (r = 0.536, p = 0.02). The ∆KYN/TRP ratio was also significantly correlated with the ∆CES-D score (r = 0.586, p = 0.01). Mediation analysis showed that the relationship between the ∆KYN/TRP ratio and the ∆CES-D score was mediated by the ∆IL-1β. Subgroup analysis showed that participants with high CES-D scores had significantly higher concentrations of IL-1β, and all correlations were maintained or strengthened within this subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results demonstrated the effectiveness of targeting inflammation as a means of improving mood in SCI, with potential mechanisms relating to the reduction in IL-1β and improvements in levels of neuroactive compounds related to the kynurenine pathway. Due to the limited sample size, results should be interpreted with caution; however, they are worthy of further examination due to the potential impact of inflammation on depression.

The antidepressant-like effect of memantine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) was prevented by pretreatment with L-arginine (750 mg/kg, i.p.) or S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP, 25 microg/site, i.c.v.), but not with d-arginine (750 mg/kg, i.p.).The treatment of mice with NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) potentiated the effect of a subeffective dose of memantine (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) in the FST. Moreover, the pretreatment of mice with (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazole[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one) (ODQ, 30 pmol/site, i.c.v.) produced a synergistic antidepressant-like effect with subeffective doses of memantine (0.3 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.) in the FST. Furthermore, the reduction in the immobility time elicited by memantine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) in the FST was prevented by pretreatment with sildenafil (5 mg/kg, i.p.). Taken together, the results demonstrate that memantine produced an antidepressant-like effect in the FST that seems to be mediated through an interaction with the L-arginine-NO-cGMP pathway.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Almeida RC ; Felisbino CS ; López MG ; Rodrigues AL ; Gabilan NH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2005.11.023 ","Keywords":"Analysis of Variance\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nArginine/*physiology\r\nCyclic GMP/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Interactions\r\nEnzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology\r\nFemale\r\nImmobility Response, Tonic/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMemantine/*administration & dosage\r\nMice\r\nNitric Oxide/*physiology\r\nNitric Oxide Donors/pharmacology\r\nNitroarginine/pharmacology\r\nPenicillamine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology\r\nPiperazines/pharmacology\r\nPurines\r\nSildenafil Citrate\r\nSulfones\r\nSwimming","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Almeida RC, Felisbino CS, López MG, Rodrigues AL, and Gabilan NH (2006) Evidence for the involvement of L-arginine-nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway in the antidepressant-like effect of memantine in mice..

Herein, we explored the antidepressant-like effect and its monoaminergic mechanism of the total flavonoids (XBXT-2) isolated from the extract of XBXT. In present study, single XBXT-2 (25, 50, 100 mg/kg, p.o.) administration significantly potentiated the mouse head-twitch response induced by 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP, a metabolic precursor to serotonin), and also, decreased the immobility time in mouse tail suspension test, which was completely prevented by p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis) pretreatment. However, single treatment with XBXT-2 had no effect on yohimbine toxicity and high dose of apomorphine-induced hypothermia in mice. These results indicated that acute treatment with XBXT-2 produced serotonergic, but not noradrenergic activation. In addition, chronic XBXT-2 (25, 50 mg/kg, p.o., 28 days) treatments significantly reversed the depressive-like behaviors in chronically mildly stressed (CMS) rats, including the reduced sucrose preference, deficient locomotor activity and prolonged latency to novelty-suppressed feeding. Furthermore, XBXT-2 normalized the neurotransmitter changes, including the decreased serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in CMS rats. These findings confirm the antidepressant-like effect of XBXT-2 in CMS model of rats, which may be primarily based on its serotonergic activation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"An L ; Zhang YZ ; Yu NJ ; Liu XM ; Zhao N ; Yuan L ; Li YF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pbb.2008.02.014 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology\r\nApomorphine/toxicity\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nDepression/drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDrugs, Chinese Herbal/isolation & purification/*pharmacology\r\nFeeding Behavior/drug effects\r\nFenclonine/pharmacology\r\nFlavonoids/isolation & purification/*pharmacology\r\nHumans\r\nHypothermia/chemically induced/drug therapy\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred ICR\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nPhytotherapy\r\nPlant Extracts/isolation & purification/pharmacology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSerotonin/*metabolism\r\nStress, Physiological/drug therapy\r\nYohimbine/toxicity","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"An L, Zhang YZ, Yu NJ, Liu XM, Zhao N, Yuan L, and Li YF (2008) Role for serotonin in the antidepressant-like effect of a flavonoid extract of Xiaobuxin-Tang..

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a nutraceutical product that has been trialed in a large number of neuropsychiatric and medical disorders, with mixed results. Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have studied NAC augmentation as an intervention in MDD and BD. These RCTs were pooled in 2 recent meta-analyses. One meta-analysis with 7 RCTs (pooled N = 728) conducted in patients with MDD or BD found that NAC was not superior to placebo in the attenuation of depression ratings in either main or sensitivity analyses. The other meta-analysis with 6 RCTs (pooled N = 248) conducted in patients with BD found a small, imprecise effect size for NAC (standardized mean difference, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.84). The advantage for NAC in this meta-analysis would almost certainly have been lost had the authors excluded from analysis 2 RCTs, both of which had problematic characteristics and findings and both of which also obtained a large and statistically significant advantage for NAC. At present, therefore, evidence does not encourage the use of NAC as an augmentation treatment for patients with MDD or BD. It remains to be seen whether NAC augmentation benefits depressed subpopulations, such as those with higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers at baseline.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Andrade C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.21f13891 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/*pharmacology\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nMeta-Analysis as Topic\r\n*Outcome Assessment, Health Care\r\nTranquilizing Agents/pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Andrade C (2021) N-Acetylcysteine Augmentation for Patients With Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Depression..

In this paper, we review the published scientific evidence on the benefits and risks of CAM for the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder. Since very few studies of CAM have involved patients with bipolar disorder, most available evidence is derived from trials conducted in patients with major depressive disorder. The use of omega-3 fatty acids has been studied in two controlled studies in bipolar disorder while St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAMe), and acupuncture have been studied in a series of randomized controlled trials in patients with major depression. Overall, the best evidence supports the use of St. John's wort for the treatment of mild to moderate depression. SAMe may also be effective for depression. However, both of these products have the potential to induce mania; the extent of this risk needs to be quantified. St. John's wort can also interact with a variety of medications. Evidence regarding the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids or acupuncture is inconsistent. Data regarding other CAM interventions (e.g., aromatherapy massage, massage therapy, yoga) are almost entirely lacking. In conclusion, better studies are needed before CAM interventions can be recommended to patients with bipolar disorder. In the meantime, patients need to be informed about the possible risks associated with the use of these interventions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Andreescu C ; Mulsant BH ; Emanuel JE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2008.03.015 ","Keywords":"Acupuncture Therapy\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/psychology/*therapy\r\nComplementary Therapies/*methods\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nHypericum/chemistry\r\nPhytotherapy/methods\r\nPlant Extracts/therapeutic use\r\nPlant Preparations/therapeutic use\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Andreescu C, Mulsant BH, and Emanuel JE (2008) Complementary and alternative medicine in the treatment of bipolar disorder--a review of the evidence..

Some studies have strongly suggested the involvement of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of BD. Paradoxal sleep deprivation (PSD) in mice has been considered a good animal model of mania because it induces similar manic-like behavior, as well as producing the neurochemical alterations which have been observed in bipolar patients. Thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of the antioxidant agent's n-acetylcysteine (Nac) and/or deferoxamine (DFX) on behavior and the oxidative stress parameters in the brains of mice submitted to the animal model of mania induced by PSD. The mice were treated for a period of seven days with saline solution (SAL), Nac, DFX or Nac plus DFX. The animals were subject to the PSD protocol for 36 h. Locomotor activity was then evaluated using the open-field test, and the oxidative stress parameters were subsequently evaluated in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice. The results showed PSD induced hyperactivity in mice, which is considered a manic-like behavior. In addition to this, PSD increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage to proteins, as well as causing alterations to antioxidant enzymes in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of mice. The Nac plus DFX adjunctive treatment prevented both the manic-like behavior and oxidative damage induced by PSD. Improving our understanding relating to oxidative damage in biomolecules, and the antioxidant mechanisms presented in the animal models of mania are important in helping to improve our knowledge concerning the pathophysiology and development of new therapeutical treatments for BD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Arent CO ; Valvassori SS ; Steckert AV ; Resende WR ; Dal-Pont GC ; Lopes-Borges J ; Amboni RT ; Bianchini G ; Quevedo J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2015.04.011 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/*therapeutic use\r\nAldehydes/metabolism\r\nAnalysis of Variance\r\nAnimals\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/etiology/pathology\r\n*Brain/drug effects/metabolism/pathology\r\nDeferoxamine/*therapeutic use\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nGlutathione Peroxidase/metabolism\r\nGlutathione Reductase/metabolism\r\nLipid Peroxidation/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nOxidative Stress/drug effects\r\nSleep Deprivation/*complications\r\nTyrosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nDeferoxamine\r\nMania\r\nOxidative stress\r\nParadoxal sleep deprivation\r\nn-Acetylcysteine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Arent CO, Valvassori SS, Steckert AV, Resende WR, Dal-Pont GC, Lopes-Borges J, Amboni RT, Bianchini G, and Quevedo J (2015) The effects of n-acetylcysteine and/or deferoxamine on manic-like behavior and brain oxidative damage in mice submitted to the paradoxal sleep deprivation model of mania..

Subjects in the L-tryptophan/placebo condition received the active substance for 4 days followed by the placebo with a 4-day washout period in between. A second group of subjects received the same regimen of reverse order and a third received placebos on both occasions. There were two additional control groups that received no substances. All subjects in the study reported decreased levels of depression due to nonspecific treatment effects. The subjects who took L-tryptophan in either sequence reported even lower levels of depression.

METHODS: This is a sub-study of a randomised controlled trial of participants with bipolar depression who provided dietary intake data (n = 133). Participants received 16 weeks adjunctive treatment of either placebo or N-acetylcysteine-alone or a combination of mitochondrial-enhancing nutraceuticals including N-acetylcysteine (combination treatment). Participants were followed up 4 weeks post-treatment discontinuation (Week 20). Diet was assessed by the Cancer Council Victoria Dietary Questionnaire for Epidemiological Studies, Version 2, converted into an Australian Recommended Food Score to measure diet quality, and energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index score to measure inflammatory potential of diet. Body mass index was also measured. Generalised estimating equation models were used to assess whether diet quality, energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index score and/or body mass index were predictors of response to significant outcomes of the primary trial: depression symptoms, clinician-rated improvement and functioning measures. RESULTS: In participants taking combination treatment compared to placebo, change in depression scores was not predicted by Australian Recommended Food Score, dietary inflammatory index or body mass index scores. However, participants with better diet quality (Australian Recommended Food Score) reported reduced general depression and bipolar depression symptoms (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively) and greater clinician-rated improvement (p = 0.02) irrespective of treatment and time. Participants who had a more anti-inflammatory dietary inflammatory index had less impairment in functioning (p = 0.01). Combination treatment may attenuate the adverse effects of pro-inflammatory diet (p = 0.03) on functioning. Participants with lower body mass index who received combination treatment (p = 0.02) or N-acetylcysteine (p = 0.02) showed greater clinician-rated improvement. CONCLUSION: These data support a possible association between diet (quality and inflammatory potential), body mass index and response to treatment for bipolar depression in the context of a nutraceutical trial. The results should be interpreted cautiously because of limitations, including numerous null findings, modest sample size and being secondary analyses.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ashton MM ; Dean OM ; Marx W ; Mohebbi M ; Berk M ; Malhi GS ; Ng CH ; Cotton SM ; Dodd S ; Sarris J ; Hopwood M ; Faye-Chauhan K ; Kim Y ; Dash SR ; Jacka FN ; Shivappa N ; Hebert JR ; Turner A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0004867419882497 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/*therapeutic use\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nBipolar Disorder/*diet therapy\r\n*Body Mass Index\r\n*Diet\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nbody mass index\r\ndiet quality\r\ndietary inflammatory index\r\nnutraceuticals","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ashton MM, Dean OM, Marx W, Mohebbi M, Berk M, Malhi GS, Ng CH, Cotton SM, Dodd S, Sarris J, Hopwood M, Faye-Chauhan K, Kim Y, Dash SR, Jacka FN, Shivappa N, Hebert JR, and Turner A (2020) Diet quality, dietary inflammatory index and body mass index as predictors of response to adjunctive N-acetylcysteine and mitochondrial agents in adults with bipolar disorder: A sub-study of a randomised placebo-controlled trial..

Decreased D-serine levels have been associated with age-related decline in mechanisms of learning and memory in animal studies. Here, we asked whether D-serine administration in older adults improves cognition. RESULTS: D-serine administration improved performance in the Groton Maze learning test of spatial memory and learning and problem solving (F(3, 38)= 4.74, p = 0.03). Subjects that achieved higher increases in plasma D-serine levels after administration improved more in test performance (r2=-0.19 p = 0.009). D-serine administration was not associated with any significant changes in the other cognitive tests or in the mood of older adults (p > 0.05). METHODS: Fifty healthy older adults received D-serine and placebo in a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study. We studied the effect of D-serine administration on the performance of cognitive tests and an analogue mood scale. We also collected blood samples to measure D-serine, L-serine, glutamate and glutamine levels. CONCLUSIONS: D-serine administration may be a strategy to improve spatial memory, learning and problem solving in healthy older adults. Future studies should evaluate the impact of long-term D-serine administration on cognition in older adults.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Avellar M ; Scoriels L ; Madeira C ; Vargas-Lopes C ; Marques P ; Dantas C ; Manhães AC ; Leite H ; Panizzutti R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.18632/oncotarget.7691 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nCognition Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMood Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPrognosis\r\nSerine/*administration & dosage/blood\r\nD-serine\r\nGerotarget\r\naging\r\ncognition\r\nglutamate metabolism\r\nmood","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Avellar M, Scoriels L, Madeira C, Vargas-Lopes C, Marques P, Dantas C, Manhães AC, Leite H, and Panizzutti R (2016) The effect of D-serine administration on cognition and mood in older adults..

However to date no systematic evaluations of the efficacy of add on anti-inflammatory treatment for the depressive and manic episodes have been carried out. METHODS: Sixteen articles were ultimately identified - by computer searches of databases (including PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and EMBASE), supplemented by hand searches and personal communication - as meeting study inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Anti-manic effects were evaluated in two trials, one of adjunctive n-acetyl cysteine (NAC), one of omega-3 fatty acids (O3FA), and significant improvements only emerged for NAC. Celecoxib had a rapid but short-lived antidepressant effect. Despite limited effects of O3FA on symptoms, imaging data demonstrated alterations in neuronal functioning that might have longer-term therapeutic effects. Evidence was strongest for adjunctive NAC in bipolar depression though conclusions are limited by small sample sizes. LIMITATIONS: Definitive conclusions are limited by the paucity of data, small study sizes, and the variability in methodology used. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence for aspirin or celecoxib is insufficient though further investigation of the potential of celecoxib in early illness onset is warranted. Variable evidence exists for add-on O3FA though an indication of short-term treatment effects on membrane fluidity and neuronal activity suggest longer follow-up assessment is needed. The strongest evidence emerged for NAC in depression and future studies must address the role of illness duration and patients׳ baseline medications on outcomes. Careful consideration of lithium toxicity in the elderly and renal impaired is essential.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ayorech Z ; Tracy DK ; Baumeister D ; Giaroli G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2014.12.015 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nAnti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nCytokine\r\nDepression\r\nInflammation\r\nLithium\r\nMania","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ayorech Z, Tracy DK, Baumeister D, and Giaroli G (2015) Taking the fuel out of the fire: evidence for the use of anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of bipolar disorders..

Biochemical aspects of the serotonin deficiency in major depressive disorder (MDD) are discussed here in detail. The deficiency is caused by a decreased availability of the serotonin precursor tryptophan (Trp) to the brain. This decrease is caused by accelerated Trp degradation, most likely induced by enhancement of the hepatic enzyme tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) by glucocorticoids and/or catecholamines. Induction of the extrahepatic Trp-degrading enzyme indolylamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) by the modest immune activation in MDD has not been demonstrated and, if it occurs, is unlikely to make a significant contribution. Liver TDO appears to be a target of many antidepressants, the mood stabilisers Li(+) and carbamazepine and possibly other adjuncts to antidepressant therapy. The poor, variable and modest antidepressant efficacy of Trp is due to accelerated hepatic Trp degradation, and efficacy can be restored or enhanced by combination with antidepressants or other existing or new TDO inhibitors. Enhancing Trp availability to the brain is thus the key to normalisation of serotonin synthesis and could form the basis for future antidepressant drug development.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Badawy AA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0269881113499209 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBrain/*drug effects/*metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nSerotonin/*biosynthesis\r\nTryptophan/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nTryptophan Hydroxylase/metabolism\r\nTryptophan Oxygenase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism\r\nAdrenal medullary hormones\r\nantidepressants\r\ncortisol\r\ndepression\r\nimmune activation\r\nnonesterified fatty acids\r\nserotonin\r\ntryptophan\r\ntryptophan dioxygenase","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Badawy AA (2013) Tryptophan: the key to boosting brain serotonin synthesis in depressive illness..

The material is remarkably well tolerated when given by injection or intravenous infusion for this purpose, even in elderly or demented patients. Assuming that the toluene sulfonate component is inert, SAMe appears to have central neuropharmacologic effects after systemic injection in high doses. Nevertheless, the functional consequences of these remain unclear and, indeed, the ability of exogenous SAMe to reach the brain, and especially neuronal cytoplasm, is limited. SAMe has small effects on monoamine metabolism and, after injection, appears to have effects on the microviscosity of cell membranes that may be related to stimulation of phospholipid synthesis. The recent introduction of an orally administered form of SAMe for use in the treatment of osteoarthritis promises to stimulate further study of SAMe in disease-associated depression, major depressive disorder, and other neuropsychiatric conditions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baldessarini RJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/0002-9343(87)90860-6 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAffect/*drug effects\r\nAnimals\r\nCatecholamines/metabolism\r\nCell Membrane/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nInfusions, Intravenous\r\nPhospholipids/metabolism\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baldessarini RJ (1987) Neuropharmacology of S-adenosyl-L-methionine..

Some evidence shows that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have promising antidepressant effects. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may enhance the effects of NSAIDs. No study has, however, tested the adjunctive therapeutic benefits of an NSAID and NAC in bipolar disorder. METHODS: The sample included 24 medicated patients diagnosed with DSM-IV-TR bipolar disorder who were aged 18-65 years and had a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score ≥ 20. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either aspirin (1,000 mg), NAC (1,000 mg), combined aspirin and NAC (1,000 mg each), or placebo. Data were collected between 2013 and 2017. The primary outcome was a ≥ 50% reduction in MADRS scores. Participants completed mood and global functioning questionnaires. They also underwent blood tests prior to and following 8 and 16 weeks of treatment. A Bayesian analytic method was adopted, and posterior probability distributions were calculated to determine the probability of treatment response. RESULTS: Following the first 8-week treatment phase, individuals on treatment with placebo and NAC + aspirin had a similar probability for successful treatment response (about 70%). Following a 16-week treatment period, NAC + aspirin was associated with higher probability of treatment response (67%) compared to placebo (55%), NAC (57%), and aspirin (33%). There was no treatment effect on interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein levels at either 8 or 16 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The coadministration of NAC and aspirin during a period of 16 weeks was associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms. The adverse effects were minimal. These preliminary findings may serve as a starting point for future studies assessing the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents in the treatment of bipolar depression.

No statistical difference could be found between these two drug treatment groups (Student's t-test) using the Hamilton Depression Scale and the Bf-S self rating questionnaire. Ratings for anxiety were significantly lower in the imipramine group on days 10 and 20, but not on day 30; in addition, sleep disturbances were more influenced by imipramine on days 1, 5, and 10, but not on days 20 and 30. Separate analysis of psychopathological syndromes as somatic depressive syndrome and retarded depressive syndrome did not show a group difference (0.05 level of significance using a two-way analysis of variance). It is concluded that DL-phenylalanine might have substantial antidepresant properties. However, certain methodological considerations still warrant a careful interpretation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Beckmann H ; Athen D ; Olteanu M ; Zimmer R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/BF00585677 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Evaluation\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nImipramine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPhenylalanine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Beckmann H, Athen D, Olteanu M, and Zimmer R (1979) DL-phenylalanine versus imipramine: a double-blind controlled study..

To test this hypothesis while establishing a platform to examine target engagement of potential therapies in patients with increased inflammation, medically stable unmedicated adult MDD outpatients enrolled to have a range of inflammation (as indexed by plasma C-reactive protein [CRP] levels) were studied at two visits involving acute challenge with the dopamine precursor levodopa (L-DOPA; 250 mg) and placebo (double-blind, randomized order ~1-week apart). The primary outcome of resting-state (rs)FC in a classic ventral striatum to ventromedial prefrontal cortex reward circuit was calculated using a targeted, a priori approach. Data available both pre- and post-challenge (n = 31/40) established stability of rsFC across visits and determined CRP > 2 mg/L as a cut-point for patients exhibiting positive FC responses (post minus pre) to L-DOPA versus placebo (p < 0.01). Higher post-L-DOPA FC in patients with CRP > 2 mg/L was confirmed in all patients (n = 40) where rsFC data were available post-challenge (B = 0.15, p = 0.006), and in those with task-based (tb)FC during reward anticipation (B = 0.15, p = 0.013). While effort-based motivation outside the scanner positively correlated with rsFC independent of treatment or CRP, change in anhedonia scores negatively correlated with rsFC after L-DOPA only in patients with CRP > 2 mg/L (r = -0.56, p = 0.012). FC in reward circuitry should be further validated in larger samples as a biomarker of target engagement for potential treatments including dopaminergic agents in MDD patients with increased inflammation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bekhbat M ; Li Z ; Mehta ND ; Treadway MT ; Lucido MJ ; Woolwine BJ ; Haroon E ; Miller AH ; Felger JC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41380-022-01715-3 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nHumans\r\n*Anhedonia/physiology\r\nDopamine\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\nNeural Pathways\r\nDepression\r\nLevodopa/therapeutic use\r\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\r\nReward\r\nInflammation/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bekhbat M, Li Z, Mehta ND, Treadway MT, Lucido MJ, Woolwine BJ, Haroon E, Miller AH, and Felger JC (2022) Functional connectivity in reward circuitry and symptoms of anhedonia as therapeutic targets in depression with high inflammation: evidence from a dopamine challenge study..

Also thyroid and gonadal functions decline during aging while gonadotropins (luteotropic hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)) steadily increase. A desynchronization of pineal circadian cyclicity as expressed by the progressive decrease of the MEL night peak may be permissively linked to the onset and progression of menopause. We studied the effects of exogenous, evening administration of MEL on the level of hormones which are known to be involved in the genesis and progression of menopause. Perimenopausal and menopausal women from 42 to 62years of age with no pathology or medication were selected. MEL was measured in saliva to divide them into low, medium and high-MEL patients. Half of them took 3mg MEL and half of them Placebo at bedtime (10-12p.m.) in a fully randomized and double-blind fashion. Three and six months later blood was taken for determination of pituitary (LH, FSH), ovarian, and thyroid hormones I(T3 and T4). All women taking MEL with low basal level of MEL and/or Placebo for three and six months showed a significant increase in levels of thyroid hormones. Before initiation of the study, a negative correlation was found in all women between LH, FSH and basal MEL levels. Within six months of treatment, MEL produced a significant diminution of LH in the younger women (43 to 49year-old), while no effect was seen in the older women (50-62years old). A decrement of FSH was observed in MEL-treated women with low basal MEL levels. In addition, most MEL-treated women reported a general improvement of mood and a significant mitigation of depression. MEL decline during aging may thus signal the derangement of pineal and pituitary-controlled ovarian cyclicity and the progressive quenching of fertility in women.

S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) is the most important methyl donor in the brain and is essential for polyamine synthesis. Methyl group deficiency in the brain has been implicated in depression; on the other hand, polyamines enhance phosphorylation processes, and phosphorylation of functional proteins in neurons in involved in the therapeutic mechanisms of antidepressants. 2. The effect of SAMe in an animal model of 'depression', the chronic mild stress-induced anhedonia, was studied using long-term castrated male and female Lister hooded rats. 3. Chronic daily exposure to an unpredictable sequence of mild stressors produced, within 3 weeks, a significant reduction of the consumption of a sucrose solution. SAMe (100, 200 or 300 mg kg-1 daily i.m.) while having no influence on sucrose intake in non-stressed animals, dose-dependently reinstated sucrose consumption within the first week of treatment, both in male and in female stressed rats. Imipramine (10 mg kg-1 daily i.p.) produced a similar effect after a 3 week treatment. 4. Similarly, a palatable food reward-induced place preference conditioning was developed in SAMe (200 or 300 mg kg-1 daily i.m.)--and in imipramine (10 mg kg-1 daily i.p.)--treated chronically stressed animals (males and females), whilst it could not be obtained in vehicle-treated rats. 5. Moreover, the same doses of SAMe (but not of imipramine) restored the exploratory activity and curiosity for the environment (rearing), in the open-field test. 6. While imipramine caused a blockade of the growth throughout the treatment, SAMe produced only a transient growth arrest during the first week of treatment. 7. These results show that SAMe reverses an experimental condition of 'depression-like' behaviour in rats, the effect being more rapid and complete than that of imipramine, and without apparent side effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Benelli A ; Filaferro M ; Bertolini A ; Genedani S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/sj.bjp.0702589 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBody Weight/drug effects\r\nCastration\r\nChronic Disease\r\nConditioning, Operant/drug effects\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDrinking Behavior/drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nMale\r\nRats\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/*pharmacology\r\nStress, Physiological/complications\r\nSucrose/administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Benelli A, Filaferro M, Bertolini A, and Genedani S (1999) Influence of S-adenosyl-L-methionine on chronic mild stress-induced anhedonia in castrated rats..

Both depression and bipolar disorder are complicated by glutathione depletion. We hypothesized that treatment with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a safe, orally bioavailable precursor of glutathione, may improve the depressive component of bipolar disorder. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study of individuals (n = 75) with bipolar disorder in the maintenance phase treated with NAC (1 g twice daily) adjunctive to usual medication over 24 weeks, with a 4-week washout. The two primary outcomes were the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and time to a mood episode. Secondary outcomes included the Bipolar Depression Rating Scale and 11 other ratings of clinical status, quality of life, and functioning. RESULTS: NAC treatment caused a significant improvement on the MADRS (least squares mean difference [95% confidence interval]: -8.05 [-13.16, -2.95], p = .002) and most secondary scales at end point. Benefit was evident by 8 weeks on the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale and Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale and at 20 weeks on the MADRS. Improvements were lost after washout. There was no effect of NAC on time to a mood episode (log-rank test: p = .968) and no significant between-group differences in adverse events. Effect sizes at end point were medium to high for improvements in MADRS and 9 of the 12 secondary readouts. CONCLUSIONS: NAC appears a safe and effective augmentation strategy for depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Berk M ; Copolov DL ; Dean O ; Lu K ; Jeavons S ; Schapkaitz I ; Anderson-Hunt M ; Bush AI ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.04.022 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/*therapeutic use\r\nAdult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*epidemiology\r\nDepression/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*epidemiology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Berk M, Copolov DL, Dean O, Lu K, Jeavons S, Schapkaitz I, Anderson-Hunt M, and Bush AI (2008) N-acetyl cysteine for depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder--a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial..

This dysregulation may be amenable to therapeutic intervention. Glutathione is the predominant non-enzymatic intracellular free radical scavenger in the brain, and the most generic of all endogenous antioxidants in terms of action. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a glutathione precursor that effectively replenishes brain glutathione. Given the failure of almost all modern trials of antidepressants in bipolar disorder to demonstrate efficacy, and the limited efficacy of mood stabilisers in the depressive phase of the disorder, this is a major unmet need. METHOD: This study reports data on the treatment of 149 individuals with moderate depression during the 2 month open label phase of a randomised placebo controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of 1g BID of NAC that examined the use of NAC as a maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder. RESULTS: In this trial, the estimated mean baseline Bipolar Depression Rating Scale (BDRS) score was 19.7 (SE=0.8), and the mean BDRS score at the end of the 8 week open label treatment phase was 11.1 (SE=0.8). This reduction was statistically significant (p<0.001). Improvements in functioning and quality of life were similarly evident. CONCLUSION: These open label data demonstrate a robust decrement in depression scores with NAC treatment. Large placebo controlled trials of acute bipolar depression are warranted.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Berk M ; Dean O ; Cotton SM ; Gama CS ; Kapczinski F ; Fernandes BS ; Kohlmann K ; Jeavons S ; Hewitt K ; Allwang C ; Cobb H ; Bush AI ; Schapkaitz I ; Dodd S ; Malhi GS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2011.06.005 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/*administration & dosage\r\nAdult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nFree Radical Scavengers/*administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMood Disorders/drug therapy\r\nQuality of Life\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Berk M, Dean O, Cotton SM, Gama CS, Kapczinski F, Fernandes BS, Kohlmann K, Jeavons S, Hewitt K, Allwang C, Cobb H, Bush AI, Schapkaitz I, Dodd S, and Malhi GS (2011) The efficacy of N-acetylcysteine as an adjunctive treatment in bipolar depression: an open label trial..

To date, treatments for MDD have been derived from the monoamine hypothesis, and there is a paucity of emerging antidepressants, especially with novel mechanisms of action and treatment targets. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a redox-active glutathione precursor that decreases inflammatory cytokines, modulates glutamate, promotes neurogenesis, and decreases apoptosis, all of which contribute to the neurobiology of depression. METHOD: Participants with a current episode of MDD diagnosed according to DSM-IV-TR criteria (N = 252) were treated with NAC or placebo in addition to treatment as usual for 12 weeks and were followed to 16 weeks. Data were collected between 2007 and 2011. RESULTS: The omnibus interaction between group and visit for the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the primary outcome measure, was not significant (F₁,₅₂₀.₉ = 1.98, P = .067), and the groups did not separate at week 12 (t₃₆₀.₃ = -1.12, P = .265). However, at week 12, the scores on the Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation-Range of Impaired Functioning Tool (LIFE-RIFT) differed from placebo (P = .03). Among participants with a MADRS score ≥ 25, NAC separated from placebo at weeks 6, 8, 12, and 16 (P < .05). Additionally, the rate of change between baseline and week 16 was significant (t₂₂₁.₀₃ = -2.11, P = .036). NAC treatment was superior to placebo at week 16 for secondary readouts of function and clinical impression. Remission and response were greater in the NAC group at week 16, but not at week 12. The NAC group had a greater rate of gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Being negative at the week 12 end point, and with some positive secondary signals, the study provides only limited support for the role of NAC as a novel adjunctive therapy for MDD.

During the first 2 weeks of the trial, half of these patients received 200 mg/day of SAMe intramuscularly, while the other half received placebo. Simultaneously, oral IMI was administered to all patients at a fixed dose of 150 mg/day. The onset of clinical response was determined by evaluating patients every second day. By the end of week 2, the parenteral treatment was suppressed and IMI was adjusted according to individual needs.

Intestinal absorption of 5-HTP does not require the presence of a transport molecule, and is not affected by the presence of other amino acids; therefore it may be taken with meals without reducing its effectiveness. Unlike LT, 5-HTP cannot be shunted into niacin or protein production. Therapeutic use of 5-HTP bypasses the conversion of LT into 5-HTP by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase, which is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of serotonin. 5-HTP is well absorbed from an oral dose, with about 70 percent ending up in the bloodstream. It easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and effectively increases central nervous system (CNS) synthesis of serotonin. In the CNS, serotonin levels have been implicated in the regulation of sleep, depression, anxiety, aggression, appetite, temperature, sexual behaviour, and pain sensation. Therapeutic administration of 5-HTP has been shown to be effective in treating a wide variety of conditions, including depression, fibromyalgia, binge eating associated with obesity, chronic headaches, and insomnia.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Birdsall TC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"5-Hydroxytryptophan/metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nContraindications\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy\r\nFibromyalgia/drug therapy\r\nHeadache/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nObesity/drug therapy\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nTryptophan/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Birdsall TC (1998) 5-Hydroxytryptophan: a clinically-effective serotonin precursor..

Because of the evidence that serotonin deficiency may be an aetiological factor in some sorts of affective disorder and that serotonin is important in the biochemistry of sleep, L-tryptophan has been suggested as a \"rational\" anti-depressant and as a \"natural\" hypnotic. This paper reviews the biochemistry and pharmacology of L-tryptophan as well as the literature of the clinical trials that have been conducted with it and suggests that, by itself, L-tryptophan may be useful in mild cases of depression accompanied by endogenous features and cases of bipolar disorder resistant to standard treatments. It also potentiates the monoamine oxidase inhibitors and possibly the serotonergic tricyclic drugs. L-tryptophan may improve the depressed mood of Parkinsonian patients and has a clinically useful hypnotic action. There is evidence it may be useful in organic mental disorders induced by levodopa.

The current therapies are generally characterized by several well-known side effects which limit their prolonged use. The use of herbal medicine for the management of several psychiatric conditions is becoming more established, as it is considered a safer support to conventional pharmacotherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible anxiolytic and antidepressant activity of a fixed combination of L-theanine, Magnolia officinalis, and Melissa officinalis (TMM) in an attempt to evaluate how the multiple modulations of different physiological systems may contribute to reducing mood disorders. TMM showed an anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like activity in vivo, which was related to a neuroprotective effect in an in vitro model of excitotoxicity. The effect of TMM was not altered by the presence of flumazenil, thus suggesting a non-benzodiazepine-like mechanism of action. On the contrary, a significant reduction in the effect was observed in animals and neuronal cells co-treated with AM251, a cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) antagonist, suggesting that the endocannabinoid system may be involved in the TMM mechanism of action. In conclusion, TMM may represent a useful and safe candidate for the management of mood disorders with an innovative mechanism of action, particularly as an adjuvant to conventional therapies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Borgonetti V ; Governa P ; Biagi M ; Galeotti N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu12061803 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnti-Anxiety Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nCells, Cultured\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDrug Combinations\r\nGlutamates/*therapeutic use\r\n*Magnolia\r\nMale\r\n*Melissa\r\nMice\r\nMood Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPhytotherapy/methods\r\nPlant Extracts/*therapeutic use\r\nPlants, Medicinal\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nCB1\r\nL-theanine\r\nanxiety\r\nendocannabinoid system\r\nexcitotoxicity\r\nflumazenil\r\nmood disorders\r\nneuroprotection","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Borgonetti V, Governa P, Biagi M, and Galeotti N (2020) Novel Therapeutic Approach for the Management of Mood Disorders: In Vivo and In Vitro Effect of a Combination of L-Theanine, Melissa officinalis L. and Magnolia officinalis Rehder & E.H.

This has led to the investigation of NAC as a potential candidate for the treatment of BD. The aim of this study was to investigate metabolomic markers to identify predictors of NAC response in a cohort of BD participants. This study is a secondary analysis of a 16-week, multi-site, randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial in BD participants with a current acute depressive episode. This study included trial participants who received either NAC 2000 mg/day, or placebo. Participants (NAC: n = 31, placebo: n = 29) were assessed at baseline and week 16 using the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and were dichotomised into \"responders\" (MADRS at week 16 < 50% of MADRS at baseline) and \"non-responders\" (MADRS at week 16 > 50% at baseline). Untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was performed to analyse baseline levels of 68 serum metabolites. Of the nine metabolites that differentiated placebo and NAC groups, five were amino acids with lower levels in the NAC responder group compared with the NAC non-responders. Further analysis generated a predictive model of MADRS improvement including glycine, norleucine, threonine, proline, phenylalanine, tyrosine, glutamic acid, lysine and leucine (R(2) = 0.853; adjusted R(2) = 0.733). This prediction model predicted 85% of the variance in MADRS outcome after adjunctive treatment with NAC. BD participants with lower serum levels of free amino acids at baseline may be more likely to respond to adjunctive treatment with NAC.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bortolasci CC ; Turner A ; Mohebbi M ; Liu ZS ; Ashton M ; Gray L ; Marx W ; Walker AJ ; Kowalski GM ; Jacka F ; Berk M ; Dean OM ; Walder K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.08.034 ","Keywords":"*Acetylcysteine/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nDepression\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nAdjunctive treatment\r\nAmino acids\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nN-acetylcysteine\r\nPredictor of response","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bortolasci CC, Turner A, Mohebbi M, Liu ZS, Ashton M, Gray L, Marx W, Walker AJ, Kowalski GM, Jacka F, Berk M, Dean OM, and Walder K (2021) Baseline serum amino acid levels predict treatment response to augmentation with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in a bipolar disorder randomised trial..

Primarily through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and glutamate modulation activity, NAC has been investigated in the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar-related disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive-related disorders, substance-use disorders, neurocognitive disorders, and chronic pain. Whilst there is ample preclinical evidence and theoretical justification for the use of NAC in the treatment of multiple psychiatric disorders, clinical trials in most disorders have yielded mixed results. However, most studies have been underpowered and perhaps too brief, with some evidence of benefit only after months of treatment with NAC. Currently NAC has the most evidence of having a beneficial effect as an adjuvant agent in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, severe autism, depression, and obsessive compulsive and related disorders. Future research with well-powered studies that are of sufficient length will be critical to better understand the utility of NAC in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bradlow RCJ ; Berk M ; Kalivas PW ; Back SE ; Kanaan RA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s40263-022-00907-3 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety Disorders/drug therapy\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\n*Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/drug therapy\r\n*Schizophrenia/drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bradlow RCJ, Berk M, Kalivas PW, Back SE, and Kanaan RA (2022) The Potential of N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC) in the Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders..

RESULTS: Our meta-analysis showed a greater response rate with SAMe when compared with placebo, with a global effect size ranging from 17% to 38% depending on the definition of response, and an antidepressant effect comparable with that of standard tricyclic antidepressants. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of SAMe in treating depressive syndromes and disorders is superior with that of placebo and comparable to that of standard tricyclic antidepressants. Since SAMe is a naturally occurring compound with relatively few side-effects, it is a potentially important treatment for depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bressa GM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0404.1994.tb05403.x ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nHumans\r\nPlacebos\r\nProspective Studies\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bressa GM (1994) S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAMe) as antidepressant: meta-analysis of clinical studies..

We therefore studied the prolactin (PRL) and cortisol responses following challenges with the postsynaptic 5-HT receptor agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP), 0.5 mg/kg orally, the 5-HT precursor L-tryptophan, 100 mg/kg intravenously, and placebo in a group of 28 normal weight bulimic patients and 16 healthy controls. Patients with bulimia, regardless of the presence of major depression, had significantly blunted PRL responses following m-CPP administration compared with those in controls. In contrast, only bulimic patients with concurrent major depression had significantly blunted PRL responses following L-tryptophan administration compared with those in nondepressed bulimic patients and controls. Cortisol responses following m-CPP were not significantly different for bulimic patients vs controls, although there was a trend toward blunted cortisol responses following L-tryptophan administration in the depressed bulimic patients. These differences in neuroendocrine responses were not related to differences in age, percent of average body weight, medications, time of day, peak plasma drug levels, or baseline estradiol levels. Seasonal variations in PRL responses to both agents were identified, although covariation for season did not alter the group differences. The PRL responses following m-CPP administration were inversely correlated to baseline cortisol levels in the bulimic patients, but not in the controls, suggesting a dampening effect by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction on postsynaptic 5-HT receptor sensitivity. The reasons for the differing hormonal responses to these two serotonergic agents may relate to differential involvement of presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms, 5-HT receptor subtypes, and anatomical loci of action. The blunted PRL responses to m-CPP administration suggest that postsynaptic 5-HT receptor sensitivity is altered in bulimia nervosa, and that similar alterations in 5-HT receptors at or above the level of the hypothalamus may contribute to binge eating and other behavioral symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Brewerton TD ; Mueller EA ; Lesem MD ; Brandt HA ; Quearry B ; George DT ; Murphy DL ; Jimerson DC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1001/archpsyc.1992.01820110016002 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAge Factors\r\nBody Weight\r\nBulimia/complications/*diagnosis/physiopathology\r\nCircadian Rhythm\r\nDepressive Disorder/blood/complications/diagnosis\r\nDiagnosis, Differential\r\nEstradiol/blood\r\nHumans\r\nHydrocortisone/*blood\r\n*Piperazines/pharmacology\r\nPlacebos\r\nProlactin/*blood\r\nReceptors, Serotonin/drug effects/physiology\r\nSeasons\r\nSerotonin/physiology\r\n*Tryptophan/pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Brewerton TD, Mueller EA, Lesem MD, Brandt HA, Quearry B, George DT, Murphy DL, and Jimerson DC (1992) Neuroendocrine responses to m-chlorophenylpiperazine and L-tryptophan in bulimia..

In this regard, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), a serotonin precursor, has been given to patients with depression. Although a review of these studies suggests that 5-HTP possesses antidepressant properties, additional trials are clearly indicated. Following a discussion of the pharmacology of 5-HTP, the authors highlight adverse effects associated with its administration to depressed patients, neurologic subjects, and normal individuals. Relatively few adverse effects are associated with its use in the treatment of depressed patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Byerley WF ; Judd LL ; Reimherr FW ; Grosser BI ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"5-Hydroxytryptophan/adverse effects/metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nCarbidopa/metabolism\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Byerley WF, Judd LL, Reimherr FW, and Grosser BI (1987) 5-Hydroxytryptophan: a review of its antidepressant efficacy and adverse effects..

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is defined by impaired attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, whereas ASD is defined by social dysfunction, communicative impairment, and restricted/repetitive behaviors. They should be distinctly evaluated in children and adolescents with ASD and intellectual disability in contrast to individuals without intellectual disability, because significant differences between these conditions exist. Mood disorders are also common in ASD and should be systematically investigated in this population of children and adolescents. Approximately 50% of children and adolescents with ASD receive medication for comorbid behavioral/ADHD and mood symptoms, mostly stimulants, antiepileptics and antipsychotics. Guidelines for the evaluation and treatment including medications for ADHD-like symptoms have recently been provided and should be carefully considered. Antiepileptic drugs are commonly used in ASDs with epilepsy, because seizures are associated with ASD in 10% to 30% of young patients, and as mood stabilizers. Lithium is another option for children and adolescents with ASD who present with symptoms of a mood disorder, such as elevated moods/euphoria, mania, and paranoia, whether accompanied or not by irritability.

Peak delta PRL and tryptophan levels were inversely correlated in combined depressed and unipolar patients. Seasonality was more evident in female than in male patients.

Consequently, alternative \"natural\" antidepressant therapies widely viewed to be devoid of this risk, such as St. John's wort (SJW) and s-adenosyl methionine (SAM-e), may experience a resurgence in popularity and expansion of use beyond mild forms of depressive illness. The purpose of this article is to critically assess whether the clinical evidence supports the use of SJW and SAM-e as alternatives to conventional antidepressants in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). In addition, this article evaluates whether the behavioral adverse event profiles of SJW and SAM-e suggest an increased risk for suicidality, like their conventional counterparts. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed (Jan 1975-July 2010) to identify all English language reports of placebo-controlled studies of SJW and SAM-e conducted for psychiatric indications. MDD studies were categorized as \"positive\" or \"negative\" based on statistical superiority to placebo on prospectively-defined, primary, clinician-rated efficacy parameters (e.g., change in Hamilton Depression scores [HAM-D] or Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] total). Treatment effect size (Cohen's d) was also calculated in each case to assess the clinical relevance of the findings. Behavioral-related adverse events were summarized by treatment. RESULTS: Ten of 14 (71%) SJW studies in mild-to-moderate MDD were positive. The mean and median effect sizes for HAM-D change in those studies were 0.64 and 0.48, respectively, indicative of a moderately-large treatment effect. In the few studies that included patients with severe symptoms, however, or which evaluated long-term maintenance of effect, SJW did not differentiate from placebo. The majority of SAM-e studies in MDD were also positive (8/14, 57%); however, most were methodologically flawed to some extent. Based on the magnitude of the treatment-effect size in a number of positive studies, SJW appears to be useful for the short-term treatment of mild-to-moderate depressive illness in adults. Existing data do not support the use of SJW in more severely depressed individuals. The SAM-e clinical data also are strongly suggestive of antidepressant efficacy; however, until more rigorously generated data become available it is not possible to reach a more definitive conclusion. There are no long-term treatment data that convincingly demonstrate long-term maintenance of effect for either product. The reviewed studies did not reveal evidence of treatment-emergent suicidality, suggesting that this risk for either product is low. However, the studies examined were not prospectively designed to detect such events and therefore were likely unable to reliably assess this risk.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Carpenter DJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine\r\nHumans\r\n*Hypericum\r\nPhytotherapy/*methods\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/*therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\n*Suicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Carpenter DJ (2011) St. John's wort and S-adenosyl methionine as \"natural\" alternatives to conventional antidepressants in the era of the suicidality boxed warning: what is the evidence for clinically relevant benefit?.

Moreover, cognitive deficits associated with hippocampal dysfunction are central in depression and anxiety disorders. Furthermore, depression is accompanied by glutamatergic dysfunction which can further impair the functioning of the hippocampus. Recent studies have shown that N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a glutamate modulator produces an antidepressant-like effect by normalization of the periterminal release of glutamate and/or antioxidant effects. However, the effects of repeated NAC treatment on depression-induced anxiety, cognitive deficits, and associated neurochemical and structural alterations are relatively unknown. Accordingly, we investigated whether chronic NAC treatment could reverse cognitive deficits, and associated hippocampal volume loss and monoaminergic alterations in the neonatal clomipramine (CLI) model of depression. We found that chronic NAC treatment produces antidepressive and antianhedonic-like effects. NAC treatment also reversed CLI-induced anxiety. Interestingly, repeated NAC treatment improved the performance of CLI rats in rewarded alternation task in T-maze. The antidepressive-like and procognitive effects of NAC was associated with normalization of volume loss in CA1, dentate gyrus (DG) and hilar subfields of the hippocampus. Furthermore, NAC restored CLI-induced decrease in levels of monoamines and normalized enhanced metabolism in the hippocampus. Taken together, chronic NAC treatment ameliorates depressive and anxiety-like behavior, spatial learning deficits, and reverses CLI-induced pathological alterations at structural and neurochemical levels in the hippocampus. Our findings might help in evolving NAC as a viable pharmacotherapy for reversal of cognitive deficits in depression and associated disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chakraborty S ; Tripathi SJ ; Srikumar BN ; Raju TR ; Shankaranarayana Rao BS; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuint.2019.104605 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAnimals\r\nCognitive Dysfunction/chemically induced/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDepression/chemically induced/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nHippocampus/*chemistry/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nOrgan Size\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/toxicity\r\nAnxiety\r\nFluoxetine\r\nHippocampal subfields atrophy\r\nMonoamine metabolism\r\nN-acetyl cysteine\r\nNeonatal clomipramine-induced cognitive impairment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chakraborty S, Tripathi SJ, Srikumar BN, Raju TR, and Shankaranarayana Rao BS (2020) N-acetyl cysteine ameliorates depression-induced cognitive deficits by restoring the volumes of hippocampal subfields and associated neurochemical changes..

Depression-associated anxiety often stems from the dysfunctional hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and its altered regulation by the amygdala. Furthermore, MDD is associated with altered glutamatergic processing leading to anxiety and impaired regulation of the HPA axis. Recent studies have demonstrated that N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a pleiotropic drug, exerts antidepressant-like effect by modulation of hippocampal functions, periterminal release of glutamate, and/or redox systems. However, the effects of NAC on depression-associated anxiety, HPA axis hyperactivity, and amygdalar dysfunctions are relatively unknown. OBJECTIVES: Accordingly, we evaluated the effect of NAC on neonatal clomipramine (CLI)-induced adulthood anxiety and accompanying changes in plasma corticosterone levels, amygdalar volumes, neuronal/glial densities, levels of monoamines, and their metabolites in the amygdalar complex. RESULTS: We found that chronic treatment with NAC reverses CLI-induced anhedonia and enhanced anxiety. Interestingly, attenuation of CLI-associated anxiety in NAC-treated rats were accompanied by a reversal of adrenal and spleen hypertrophy, and normalization of enhanced plasma corticosterone levels, indicating improved HPA axis functioning. Furthermore, NAC treatment was sufficient to reverse volumetric hypertrophy of basolateral amygdala (BLA), and altered noradrenaline (NA) metabolism in the amygdalar complex. The effects of NAC in the reversal of CLI-induced impairments were similar to that of fluoxetine (FLX). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that beneficial effects of NAC on antidepressive- and antianxiety-like behaviors are at least in part mediated via restoration of amygdalar and HPA axis functioning. Our results support the hypothesis that NAC might be evolved as a therapeutic strategy for reversal of amygdalar dysfunction in depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chakraborty S ; Tripathi SJ ; Raju TR ; Shankaranarayana Rao BS; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00213-020-05585-x ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/*administration & dosage\r\nAmygdala/drug effects/metabolism\r\nAnimals\r\nAnti-Anxiety Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nAnxiety/*drug therapy/metabolism/psychology\r\nCorticosterone/metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/metabolism/psychology\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFree Radical Scavengers/*administration & dosage\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/drug effects/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System/drug effects/metabolism\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nAnxiety\r\nBasolateral amygdalar hypertrophy\r\nDepression\r\nHypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunctions\r\nN-acetyl cysteine (NAC)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chakraborty S, Tripathi SJ, Raju TR, and Shankaranarayana Rao BS (2020) Mechanisms underlying remediation of depression-associated anxiety by chronic N-acetyl cysteine treatment..

We found that a single dose of sarcosine exerted antidepressant-like effects with rapid concomitant increases in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway activation and enhancement of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate receptor (AMPAR) membrane insertion. Sarcosine may play a crucial role in developing novel therapy for depression. For a detailed understanding of sarcosine, this study examined the effects of long-term sarcosine treatment on the forced swim test (FST), mTOR signaling, and AMPAR membrane insertion in rats. The effects of long-term sarcosine treatment were examined in naive rats and rats exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Long-term sarcosine treatment (560mg/kg/d for 21 d) significantly ameliorated the increased immobility induced by CUS in the FST, reaffirming the potential role of sarcosine as an antidepressant for depressed patients. The same long-term treatment exhibited no such effect in naive rats despite increased mTOR activation and AMPAR membrane insertion in both groups. Our findings clearly show CUS-exposed rats are sensitive to long-term sarcosine treatment in FST and the response at the same dose is absent in naïve rats. Nevertheless, the distinct sensitivity to long-term sarcosine treatment in rats with or without CUS is not associated with the activated mTOR signaling pathway or increased AMPAR membrane insertion. Additionally, understanding the behavioral and molecular basis of distinct responses is vital important for developing personalized treatment programs to increase the probability of success when treating depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chen KT ; Wu CH ; Tsai MH ; Wu YC ; Jou MJ ; Huang CC ; Wei IH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2016.06.004 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/*etiology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nMAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMaze Learning/drug effects\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nReceptors, AMPA/metabolism\r\nSarcosine/*therapeutic use\r\nStress, Psychological/*complications\r\nSwimming/psychology\r\nTOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism\r\nTime Factors\r\nUp-Regulation/drug effects\r\nAMPA\r\nDepression\r\nLong-term treatment\r\nSarcosine\r\nmTOR","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chen KT, Wu CH, Tsai MH, Wu YC, Jou MJ, Huang CC, and Wei IH (2017) Antidepressant-like effects of long-term sarcosine treatment in rats with or without chronic unpredictable stress..

D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist of the glycine co-agonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor, is potentially effective as a depression augmentation treatment. However, whether DCS maintains the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine infusion remains unknown. In all, 32 patients with TRD (17 with major depression and 15 with bipolar depression) who responded to ketamine infusion with an average 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score of 9.47 ± 4.11 at baseline were randomly divided to 6-week DCS treatment (250 mg for 2 days, 500 mg for 2 days, 750 mg for 3 days, and 1000 mg for 5 weeks) and placebo groups. Depression symptoms were rated at timepoints of dose titration and weekly. During the 6-week treatment, the total scores of HAMD did not differ between the DCS and placebo groups. The results remained consistent when stratified by disorder. A mixed model analysis indicated that the DCS group exhibited lower scores of HAMD item 3 (suicide) compared with the placebo group throughout the follow-up period (p = 0.01). A superior maintenance of the antisuicidal effect of ketamine was observed in the DCS group than in the placebo group. DCS may be therapeutically beneficial for patients with TRD who responded to ketamine infusion but have a residual suicidal risk.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chen MH ; Cheng CM ; Gueorguieva R ; Lin WC ; Li CT ; Hong CJ ; Tu PC ; Bai YM ; Tsai SJ ; Krystal JH ; Su TP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41386-019-0480-y ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nCycloserine/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nKetamine/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\n*Suicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chen MH, Cheng CM, Gueorguieva R, Lin WC, Li CT, Hong CJ, Tu PC, Bai YM, Tsai SJ, Krystal JH, and Su TP (2019) Maintenance of antidepressant and antisuicidal effects by D-cycloserine among patients with treatment-resistant depression who responded to low-dose ketamine infusion: a double-blind randomized placebo-control study..

Although ketamine, benzoate, and sarcosine act differently as the antagonists or coagonists of NMDARs, they all have demonstrated efficacy in animal models or human trials. In vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that sarcosine, benzoate, and ketamine exert their anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting microglial activity. This review summarizes and compares the efficacy of the possible therapeutic mechanisms of sarcosine, benzoate, ketamine, esketamine, and arketamine. These compounds act as both NMDAR modulators and anti-inflammatory drugs and thus can be effective in the treatment of depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cheng YJ ; Lin CH ; Lane HY ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuropharm.2022.109351 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nHumans\r\n*Sarcosine/pharmacology\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBenzoates\r\n*Ketamine/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nArketamine\r\nBenzoate\r\nDepression\r\nEsketamine\r\nKetamine\r\nSarcosine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cheng YJ, Lin CH, and Lane HY (2023) Ketamine, benzoate, and sarcosine for treating depression..

The underlying pathological alterations in the brain are not fully understood so far. Dysregulation of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb has been recently suggested to be implicated in non-motor symptoms of PD. However, there is so far no direct evidence to support the relationship of non-motor symptoms and the modulation of adult neurogenesis following dopamine depletion and/or dopamine replacement. In this study, we investigated the long-term effects of l-DOPA and pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, in a mouse model of bilateral intranigral 6-OHDA lesion, in order to assess the impact of adult neurogenesis on non-motor behavior. We found that l-DOPA and pramipexole can normalize decreased neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the periglomerular layer of the olfactory bulb caused by a 6-OHDA lesion. Interestingly, pramipexole showed an antidepressant and anxiolytic effect in the forced swim test and social interaction test. However, there was no significant change in learning and memory function after dopamine depletion and dopamine replacement, respectively.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chiu WH ; Depboylu C ; Hermanns G ; Maurer L ; Windolph A ; Oertel WH ; Ries V ; Höglinger GU ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuropharm.2015.03.020 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntiparkinson Agents/*pharmacology\r\nAnxiety/drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology\r\nBenzothiazoles/*pharmacology\r\nDepression/drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/pathology/physiopathology\r\nLevodopa/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nNeurogenesis/*drug effects/physiology\r\nNeurons/drug effects/pathology/physiology\r\nOlfactory Bulb/drug effects/pathology/physiopathology\r\nOxidopamine\r\nParkinsonian Disorders/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology/psychology\r\nPramipexole\r\nRandom Allocation\r\n6-Hydroxydopamine\r\nAdult neurogenesis\r\nHippocampal dentate gyrus\r\nOlfactory bulb\r\nParkinson's disease\r\nPramipexole\r\nl-DOPA","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chiu WH, Depboylu C, Hermanns G, Maurer L, Windolph A, Oertel WH, Ries V, and Höglinger GU (2015) Long-term treatment with L-DOPA or pramipexole affects adult neurogenesis and corresponding non-motor behavior in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease..

Although there were no substantial differences between the three treatments, the efficacy of tryptophan-nicotinamide tended to diminish after 2 weeks when the dose of tryptophan was increased from 4 g/day to 6 g/day and that of nicotinamide from 1.0 g/day to 1.5 g/day. The therapeutic response of patients treated with tryptophan-nicotinamide was significantly correlated with the rise in plasma tryptophan. For the tryptophan-nicotinamide-imipramine group, however, therapeutic response and rise in plasma tryptophan were negatively correlated, implying that tryptophan levels were too high in some patients. The data suggest that tryptophan-nicotamide may be as effective as imipramine in unipolar patients providing the dose is kept within the therapeutic window, and that at low doses it could also potentiate the action of tricyclic antidepressants.

In this research, we focus on the antidepressant effects of oral administration of GABA-rich Monascus-fermented product in depression animal model (forced swimming test, FST) by Sprague-Dawley rats, and try to find its possible mechanism in the brain monoamine system. GABA and the Monascus-fermented product (MFP) significantly decreased the duration of immobility time in a short-term test. In a long-term test, the antidepressant-like effect of MFP was better than that of GABA at the same dosage (2.6 mg/kg), and the efficacy of MFP was similar to that of fluoxetine. Moreover, GABA might recover the level of monoamines norepinephrine, dopamine (DA), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in hippocampus and normalize the turnover ratio of 5-HT and DA in hippocampus and amygdala. In addition to the functions of GABA, the MFP has more potential in decreasing the turnover ratio of DA in the frontal cortex and striatum to improve depressive symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chuang CY ; Shi YC ; You HP ; Lo YH ; Pan TM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1021/jf104239m ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nBiogenic Monoamines/analysis\r\nBrain Chemistry\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\n*Fermentation\r\nMale\r\nMonascus/*metabolism\r\nOryza/*chemistry/microbiology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSwimming\r\ngamma-Aminobutyric Acid/*administration & dosage/analysis","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chuang CY, Shi YC, You HP, Lo YH, and Pan TM (2011) Antidepressant effect of GABA-rich monascus-fermented product on forced swimming rat model..

The NMDA-R plays an important role in synaptic plasticity, and individuals with MDD have been shown to have impairments in repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) motor plasticity. Here, we test whether D-cycloserine, a NMDA-R partial agonist, can rescue TMS motor plasticity in MDD. METHODS: We conducted randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover studies in healthy (n = 12) and MDD (n = 12) participants. We stimulated motor cortex using TMS intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) with placebo or D-cycloserine (100 mg). Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were sampled before and after iTBS. Stimulus response curves (SRC) were characterized at baseline, +90 minutes, and the following day. RESULTS: Acute iTBS MEP facilitation is reduced in MDD and is not rescued by D-cycloserine. After iTBS, SRCs shift to indicate sustained decrease in excitability in healthy participants, yet increased in excitability in MDD participants. D-cycloserine normalized SRC changes from baseline to the following day in MDD participants. In both healthy and MDD participants, D-cycloserine stabilized changes in SRC. CONCLUSION: MDD is associated with alterations in motor plasticity that are rescued and stabilized by NMDA-R agonism. SIGNIFICANCE: Agonism of NMDA receptors rescues iTBS motor plasticity in MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cole J ; Selby B ; Ismail Z ; McGirr A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.clinph.2021.04.002 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\nCycloserine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/physiopathology/*therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nEvoked Potentials, Motor/drug effects/physiology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMotor Cortex/drug effects/*physiology\r\nNeuronal Plasticity/drug effects/*physiology\r\nReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/agonists/physiology\r\nTheta Rhythm/drug effects/*physiology\r\nTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation/*methods\r\nYoung Adult\r\nD-Cycloserine\r\nIntermittent theta burst stimulation\r\nMDD\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nMotor cortex\r\nNMDA receptor","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cole J, Selby B, Ismail Z, and McGirr A (2021) D-cycloserine normalizes long-term motor plasticity after transcranial magnetic intermittent theta-burst stimulation in major depressive disorder..

The theta-burst stimulation (TBS) protocol synaptic plasticity is known to be N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor dependent, yet it is unknown whether enhancing NMDA-receptor signaling improves treatment outcomes in MDD. OBJECTIVE: To test whether low doses of the NMDA-receptor partial-agonist, D-cycloserine, would enhance intermittent TBS (iTBS) treatment outcomes in MDD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a single-site 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted from November 6, 2019, to December 24, 2020, including 50 participants with MDD. Participants were recruited via advertisements and referral. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age 18 to 65 years with a primary diagnosis of MDD, a major depressive episode with score of 18 or more on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, a Young Mania Rating Scale score of 8 or less, and normal blood work (including complete blood cell count, electrolytes, liver function tests, and creatinine level). INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to either iTBS plus placebo or iTBS plus D-cycloserine (100 mg) for the first 2 weeks followed by iTBS without an adjunct for weeks 3 and 4. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in depressive symptoms as measured by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at the conclusion of treatment. Secondary outcomes included clinical response, clinical remission, and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scores. RESULTS: A total of 50 participants (mean [SD] age, 40.8 [13.4] years; 31 female [62%]) were randomly assigned to treatment groups: iTBS plus placebo (mean [SD] baseline score, 30.3 [4.2]) and iTBS plus D-cycloserine (mean [SD] baseline score, 30.4 [4.5]). The iTBS plus D-cycloserine group had greater improvements in MADRS scores compared with the iTBS plus placebo group (mean difference, -6.15; 95% CI, -2.43 to -9.88; Hedges g = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.34-1.62). Rates of clinical response were higher in the iTBS plus D-cycloserine group than in the iTBS plus placebo group (73.9% vs 29.3%), as were rates of clinical remission (39.1% vs 4.2%). This was reflected in lower CGI-severity ratings and greater CGI-improvement ratings. No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings from this clinical trial indicate that adjunctive D-cycloserine may be a promising strategy for enhancing transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment outcomes in MDD using iTBS requiring further investigation.

In the last years several studies have shown increased levels of inflammatory and/or immune markers in patients with mood disorders. Accordingly, the immune system has become a target of interest for the development of biomarkers and therapeutics for mood disorders. Areas covered: Here, we review the evidence showing low-grade inflammation in mood disorders and the studies evaluating immune-based strategies for the treatment of these conditions. Expert commentary: Clinical trials with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, polyunsaturated acids, N-acetylcysteine, anti-cytokines, physical activity and probiotics have provided promising results in terms of antidepressant efficacy in patients with MDD and BD. Regarding stem cells, only studies with animal models have been performed so far with interesting pre-clinical results. Due to the preliminary nature of the results, most of the clinical studies need to be replicated and/or confirmed in larger clinical settings, embracing the highly heterogeneous pathophysiology of mood disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Colpo GD ; Leboyer M ; Dantzer R ; Trivedi MH ; Teixeira AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/14737175.2018.1407242 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/therapeutic use\r\nAnimals\r\nAnti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/immunology/therapy\r\nCytokines/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/immunology/therapy\r\nExercise Therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nInflammation/drug therapy\r\nMesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation\r\nMood Disorders/drug therapy/*immunology/*therapy\r\nNeuroimmunomodulation\r\nProbiotics/therapeutic use\r\nMood disorders\r\nanti-inflammatory drugs\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ncytokines\r\nimmunomodulation\r\ninflammation\r\nmajor depressive disorder\r\nneuroinflammation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Colpo GD, Leboyer M, Dantzer R, Trivedi MH, and Teixeira AL (2018) Immune-based strategies for mood disorders: facts and challenges..

The evidence to date suggests that the amino acid is as effective as standard tricyclic drugs in alleviating the symptoms of depression, especially those cases presenting with mainly psychomotor retardation, and is synergistic with MAOIs. L-Tryptophan would also appear to be a 'physiological sedative'. This action, however, appears to be related to the time of administration and at present has only been demonstrated at night. when endogenous levels of 5-HT are at their peak.

In depressed patients who lost less than 10 lb, PRL responses were significantly reduced compared with controls. In contrast, the PRL responses of patients with weight loss exceeding 10 lb were significantly greater than those of either controls or the other depressed patients. Growth hormone responses to tryptophan were significantly decreased in patients who lost less than 10 lb. Prolactin, but not GH, responses correlated significantly with the postdexamethasone plasma cortisol concentration; however, an apparent relationship between GH and PRL responses and suicidal behavior was probably due to the common factor of weight loss. The results suggest that depressed patients have different types of abnormal 5-hydroxytryptamine-mediated neuroendocrine responses that correlate with the presence or absence of severe weight loss and cortisol hypersecretion. Further investigations are needed to establish if these abnormalities are central to the depressive disorder or have implications for treatment response.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cowen PJ ; Charig EM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1001/archpsyc.1987.01800230038008 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nBenzodiazepines/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/blood/*drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nGrowth Hormone/blood\r\nHumans\r\nHydrocortisone/blood\r\nInjections, Intravenous\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNeurosecretory Systems/*metabolism\r\nOsmolar Concentration\r\nProlactin/blood\r\nSleep Stages\r\nTryptophan/blood/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cowen PJ, and Charig EM (1987) Neuroendocrine responses to intravenous tryptophan in major depression..

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a widely available nutritional supplement that has been studied in some psychiatric disorders relevant to NSSI including mood and addictive disorders. This pilot study tested the use of NAC as a potential treatment for NSSI in youth. METHODS: Thirty-five female adolescents and young adults with NSSI aged 13-21 years were enrolled in this study that had an open-label, single-arm study design. All participants were given oral NAC as follows: 600 mg twice daily (weeks 1-2), 1200 mg twice daily (weeks 3-4), and 1800 mg twice daily (weeks 5-8). Patients were seen every 2 weeks throughout the trial, at which time youth reported the frequency of NSSI episodes. Levels of depression, impulsivity, and global psychopathology were measured at baseline and at the end of the trial using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Barratt Impulsivity Scale, and Symptoms Checklist-90 (SCL-90). RESULTS: About two-thirds of the enrolled female youth completed the trial (24/35). NAC was generally well tolerated in this sample. NAC treatment was associated with a significant decrease in NSSI frequency at visit 6 and visit 8 compared to baseline. We also found that depression scores and global psychopathology scores (but not impulsivity scores) decreased after NAC treatment. Decrease in NSSI was not correlated with decrease in BDI-II or SCL-90 scores, suggesting these might be independent effects. CONCLUSION: We provide preliminary evidence that NAC may have promise as a potential treatment option for adolescents with NSSI. The current results require follow-up with a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to confirm efficacy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cullen KR ; Klimes-Dougan B ; Westlund Schreiner M; Carstedt P ; Marka N ; Nelson K ; Miller MJ ; Reigstad K ; Westervelt A ; Gunlicks-Stoessel M ; Eberly LE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1089/cap.2017.0032 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nAdministration, Oral\r\nAdolescent\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nFemale\r\nFree Radical Scavengers/administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nHumans\r\nImpulsive Behavior/*drug effects\r\nPilot Projects\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSelf-Injurious Behavior/*drug therapy\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult\r\nN-acetylcysteine (NAC)\r\nadolescent\r\nnonsuicidal self-injurious behavior (NSSI)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cullen KR, Klimes-Dougan B, Westlund Schreiner M, Carstedt P, Marka N, Nelson K, Miller MJ, Reigstad K, Westervelt A, Gunlicks-Stoessel M, and Eberly LE (2018) N-Acetylcysteine for Nonsuicidal Self-Injurious Behavior in Adolescents: An Open-Label Pilot Study..

The anti-immobility effect of peripheral administration of creatine (1 mg/kg, p.o.) was prevented by the pretreatment of mice with α-methyl-p-tyrosine (100 mg/kg, i.p., inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase), prazosin (1 mg/kg, i.p., α1-adrenoceptor antagonist), but not by yohimbine (1 mg/kg, i.p., α2-adrenoceptor antagonist).

These results indicate that the antidepressant-like effect of creatine is likely mediated by an activation of α1-adrenoceptor and that creatine produces synergistic effects in the TST with antidepressants that modulate noradrenaline transporter, suggesting that an improvement in the response to the antidepressant therapy may occur when creatine is combined with these antidepressants. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of creatine (0.01 mg/kg, p.o.) and reboxetine (2 mg/kg, p.o.) combination was abolished by the α1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, indicating that the antidepressant-like effect of combined therapy is likely mediated by an activation of α1-adrenoceptor.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cunha MP ; Pazini FL ; Oliveira Á ; Bettio LE ; Rosa JM ; Machado DG ; Rodrigues AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2013.01.014 ","Keywords":"Adrenergic Agents/pharmacology\r\nAnalysis of Variance\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nCreatine/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/diagnosis/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDrug Interactions\r\nEnzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage\r\nExploratory Behavior/drug effects\r\nHindlimb Suspension/*methods\r\nInjections, Intraventricular\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nReceptors, Adrenergic, alpha-1/*metabolism\r\nTime Factors\r\nalpha-Methyltyrosine/administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cunha MP, Pazini FL, Oliveira Á, Bettio LE, Rosa JM, Machado DG, and Rodrigues AL (2013) The activation of α1-adrenoceptors is implicated in the antidepressant-like effect of creatine in the tail suspension test..

This study evaluated the influence of pharmacological agents that modulate NMDAR/L-arginine-NO pathway in the anti-immobility effect of creatine in the tail suspension test (TST) in mice. The NOx levels and cellular viability in hippocampal and cerebrocortical slices of creatine-treated mice were also evaluated. The anti-immobility effect of creatine (10 mg/kg, po) in the TST was abolished by NMDA (0.1 pmol/mouse, icv), D-serine (30 µg/mouse, icv, glycine-site NMDAR agonist), arcaine (1 mg/kg, ip, polyamine site NMDAR antagonist), L-arginine (750 mg/kg, ip, NO precursor), SNAP (25 μg/mouse, icv, NO donor), L-NAME (175 mg/kg, ip, non-selective NOS inhibitor) or 7-nitroindazole (50 mg/kg, ip, neuronal NOS inhibitor), but not by DNQX (2.5 µg/mouse, icv, AMPA receptor antagonist). The combined administration of sub-effective doses of creatine (0.01 mg/kg, po) and NMDAR antagonists MK-801 (0.001 mg/kg, po) or ketamine (0.1 mg/kg, ip) reduced immobility time in the TST. Creatine (10 mg/kg, po) increased cellular viability in hippocampal and cerebrocortical slices and enhanced hippocampal and cerebrocortical NO x levels, an effect potentiated by L-arginine or SNAP and abolished by 7-nitroindazole or L-NAME. In conclusion, the anti-immobility effect of creatine in the TST involves NMDAR inhibition and enhancement of NO levels accompanied by an increase in neural viability.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cunha MP ; Pazini FL ; Ludka FK ; Rosa JM ; Oliveira Á ; Budni J ; Ramos-Hryb AB ; Lieberknecht V ; Bettio LE ; Martín-de-Saavedra MD ; López MG ; Tasca CI ; Rodrigues AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00726-014-1910-0 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nArginine/*metabolism\r\nCreatine/*pharmacology\r\nDepression/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nHindlimb Suspension\r\nHumans\r\nMice\r\nNitric Oxide/*metabolism\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/genetics/*metabolism\r\nSignal Transduction","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cunha MP, Pazini FL, Ludka FK, Rosa JM, Oliveira Á, Budni J, Ramos-Hryb AB, Lieberknecht V, Bettio LE, Martín-de-Saavedra MD, López MG, Tasca CI, and Rodrigues AL (2015) The modulation of NMDA receptors and L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway is implicated in the anti-immobility effect of creatine in the tail suspension test..

However, the biological mechanisms underlying its antidepressant effect is still not fully elucidated. This study investigated the effect of creatine (p.o.) administered for 21 days in the behavior of mice submitted to tail suspension test (TST), a predictive test of antidepressant activity. Creatine reduced the immobility time in the TST (1-10 mg/kg), without affecting locomotor activity, a finding consistent with an antidepressant profile. Creatine administration increased the ubiquitous creatine kinase (uCK) and creatine kinase brain isoform (CK-B) mRNA in the hippocampus of mice. Taking into account that PGC-1α induces FNDC5/irisin expression mediating BDNF-dependent neuroplasticity, the effect of creatine administration (1 mg/kg, p. o.) on the hippocampal PGC-1α, FNDC5 and BDNF gene expression was investigated. Creatine treatment increased PGC-1α, FNDC5 and BDNF mRNA in the hippocampus as well as BDNF immunocontent. The involvement of BDNF downstream intracellular signaling pathway mediated by Akt, proapoptotic proteins BAX and BAD and antiapoptotic proteins Bcl2 and Bcl-xL was also investigated following creatine treatment. Creatine increased Akt phosphorylation (Ser 473), and Bcl2 mRNA and protein levels, and Bcl-xL mRNA, whereas BAD mRNA was decreased following creatine administration in the hippocampus. Altogether these results indicate that creatine antidepressant-like effect may be dependent on Akt activation and increased expression of the neuroprotective proteins in the hippocampus of mice. The obtained data reinforce the antidepressant property of creatine and highlight the role of these molecular targets in the pathophysiology of MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cunha MP ; Pazini FL ; Lieberknecht V ; Rodrigues ALS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2018.07.001 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/metabolism\r\nCreatine/*administration & dosage\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nFemale\r\nFibronectins/genetics/metabolism\r\nGene Expression Regulation/*drug effects\r\nHindlimb Suspension\r\nHippocampus/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nLocomotion/drug effects\r\nMAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects\r\nMice\r\nOncogene Protein v-akt/genetics/metabolism\r\nProto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism\r\nRNA, Messenger/metabolism\r\nbcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism\r\nAkt\r\nAntidepressant\r\nBDNF\r\nBcl2\r\nCreatine\r\nFNDC5","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cunha MP, Pazini FL, Lieberknecht V, and Rodrigues ALS (2018) Subchronic administration of creatine produces antidepressant-like effect by modulating hippocampal signaling pathway mediated by FNDC5/BDNF/Akt in mice..

Post stroke depression (PSD) is a complication of stroke with high clinical relevance, yielding increasing mortality and morbidity rates, and a lower response to common therapies and rehabilitation. METHODS: Two chemically characterized commercial samples of GGABA and OGABA were investigated for effects on mood following oral administration using a mouse model of PSD, through common validated tests including the Despair Swimming Test and Tail Suspension Test. Moreover, the antioxidant activity of GGABA and OGABA was evaluated by determining the levels of lipid peroxidation products and the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the mouse brain in vivo. RESULTS: GGABA and OGABA attenuated depressed mood by influencing behavioral parameters linked to depression. GGABA was more active than OGABA in this study, and this effect may be likely due to a higher content of polyphenolic substances and amino acids in GGABA compared to OGABA. GGABA also exerted a greater antioxidant activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that GABA tea is a promising candidate that can be used as an adjuvant in the management of PSD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Daglia M ; Di Lorenzo A ; Nabavi SF ; Sureda A ; Khanjani S ; Moghaddam AH ; Braidy N ; Nabavi SM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu9050446 ","Keywords":"Affect/*drug effects\r\nAnimals\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nGlutamates/pharmacology\r\nGlutamic Acid/pharmacology\r\nGlutamine/pharmacology\r\nLipid Peroxidation/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred BALB C\r\nPlant Extracts/*pharmacology\r\nPolyphenols/pharmacology\r\nReproducibility of Results\r\nStroke/drug therapy/psychology\r\nTea/*chemistry\r\ngamma-Aminobutyric Acid/*pharmacology\r\nGABA green tea\r\nGABA oolong tea\r\nantioxidant activity\r\npost-stroke depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Daglia M, Di Lorenzo A, Nabavi SF, Sureda A, Khanjani S, Moghaddam AH, Braidy N, and Nabavi SM (2017) Improvement of Antioxidant Defences and Mood Status by Oral GABA Tea Administration in a Mouse Model of Post-Stroke Depression..

In addition to its role in physical performance, creatine supplementation has protective effects on the brain in models of neuronal damage and also alters mood state and cognitive performance. Creatine is found in high protein foods, such as fish or meat, and is also produced endogenously from the biosynthesis of arginine, glycine, and methionine. Changes in brain creatine levels, as measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, are seen in individuals exposed to drugs of abuse and depressed individuals. These changes in brain creatine indicate that energy metabolism differs in these populations relative to healthy individuals. Recent work shows that creatine supplementation has the ability to function in a manner similar to antidepressant drugs and can offset negative consequences of stress. These observations are important in relation to addictive behaviors as addiction is influenced by psychological factors such as psychosocial stress and depression. The significance of altered brain levels of creatine in drug-exposed individuals and the role of creatine supplementation in models of drug abuse have yet to be explored and represent gaps in the current understanding of brain energetics and addiction.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"D'Anci KE ; Allen PJ ; Kanarek RB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s12035-011-8176-2 ","Keywords":"Brain/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nBrain Injuries/drug therapy\r\nCreatine/administration & dosage/metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy/physiopathology\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nEnergy Metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nMolecular Structure\r\nSubstance-Related Disorders/*drug therapy/physiopathology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"D'Anci KE, Allen PJ, and Kanarek RB (2011) A potential role for creatine in drug abuse?.

A correlation between the β-amyloid protein accumulation and the development of depression has been suggested, however the underlying mechanisms are unknown. d-Aspartate (d-Asp) is a free d-amino acid found in the mammalian brain and involved in neurological and psychiatric processes, such as cognition and affective disorders. In this study we have investigated the effects of a repeated treatment with d-Asp in a long-lasting (12 months) model of neuropathic pain, the spared nerve injury (SNI), in mice. Specifically, we evaluated i) the pain sensitivity and related emotional/cognitive dysfunctions induced by SNI, ii) possible changes in the β-amyloid protein accumulation in specific brain regions involved in pain mechanisms ii) possible changes in steroids level in neuropathic animals with or without d-Asp in the same brain areas. SNI mice showed an increase of the insoluble form of Aβ(1-42) at hippocampal level and displayed cognitive impairments, stereotypical and depressive-like behaviours. d-Asp treatment reduced abnormal behaviours and normalized the β-amyloid protein expression. Moreover, d-Asp dramatically increased steroids level measured in the prefrontal cortex and in the hippocampus. Our findings provide new insights into pain mechanisms and suggest a possible role of β-amyloid protein in neuropsychiatric dysfunctions associated with chronic pain.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"D'Aniello A ; Luongo L ; Romano R ; Iannotta M ; Marabese I ; Boccella S ; Belardo C ; de Novellis V ; Arra C ; Barbieri A ; D'Aniello B ; Scandurra A ; Magliozzi L ; Fisher G ; Guida F ; Maione S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neulet.2017.04.041 ","Keywords":"Amyloid beta-Peptides/*metabolism\r\nAnimals\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nD-Aspartic Acid/*administration & dosage\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nGonadal Steroid Hormones/metabolism\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/*metabolism\r\nHyperalgesia/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nNeuralgia/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nPain Threshold/drug effects\r\nPeptide Fragments/*metabolism\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/drug effects/*metabolism\r\nDepression\r\nHippocampus\r\nNeuropathic pain\r\nβ-amyloid","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"D'Aniello A, Luongo L, Romano R, Iannotta M, Marabese I, Boccella S, Belardo C, de Novellis V, Arra C, Barbieri A, D'Aniello B, Scandurra A, Magliozzi L, Fisher G, Guida F, and Maione S (2017) d-Aspartic acid ameliorates painful and neuropsychiatric changes and reduces β-amyloid Aβ(1-42) peptide in a long lasting model of neuropathic pain..

Oral administration of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) replenishes glutathione and has therefore been shown to reduce depressive symptoms. Proton magnetic spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) that allows quantification of brain metabolites pertinent to both MDD and oxidative biology may provide some novel insights into the neurobiological effects of NAC, and in particular metabolite concentrations within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are likely to be important given the key role of this region in the regulation of affect. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the metabolite profile of the ACC in MDD patients predicts treatment with adjunctive NAC versus placebo. METHODS: This study was nested within a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of MDD participants treated with adjunctive NAC. Participants (n = 76) from one site completed the spectroscopy component at the end of treatment (12 weeks). Spectra from a single-voxel in the ACC were acquired and absolute concentrations of glutamate (Glu), glutamate-glutamine (Glx), N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and myo-inositol (mI) were obtained. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine whether metabolite profiles could predict NAC versus placebo group membership. RESULTS: When predicting group outcome (NAC or placebo), Glx, NAA and mI were a significant model, and had 75% accuracy, while controlling for depression severity and sex. However, the Glu, NAA and mI profile was only predictive at a trend level, with 68.3% accuracy. For both models, the log of the odds of a participant being in the NAC group was positively related to NAA, Glx and Glu levels and negatively related to mI levels. CONCLUSION: The finding of higher Glx and NAA levels being predictive of the NAC group provides preliminary support for the putative anti-oxidative role of NAC in MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Das P ; Tanious M ; Fritz K ; Dodd S ; Dean OM ; Berk M ; Malhi GS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0004867412474074 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAspartic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/*metabolism\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nFree Radical Scavengers/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nFunctional Neuroimaging/*psychology\r\nGlutamic Acid/metabolism\r\nGlutamine/metabolism\r\nGyrus Cinguli/drug effects/*metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nInositol/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOxidative Stress/*drug effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Das P, Tanious M, Fritz K, Dodd S, Dean OM, Berk M, and Malhi GS (2013) Metabolite profiles in the anterior cingulate cortex of depressed patients differentiate those taking N-acetyl-cysteine versus placebo..

The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in total score on Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). The Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) was rated at the endpoint. Patients with a reduction of 50% or more on HAM-D total score and a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 at endpoint were considered responders; remission was defined as a HAM-D score ≤7. Secondary outcome measures included the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). At 8 weeks, a significant decrease in HAM-D score was observed with response achieved by 60% of the patients and remission by 36%. Also a statistically significant reduction in SHAPS and SDS was observed. Our findings indicate that SAMe augmentation may be effective and well tolerated in stage II TRD.

DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE/PubMed search was carried out by using the following set of keywords: ((SAMe OR SAdenosyl- L-Methionine) AND (major depressive disorder OR depression)). Data Selection and Data Extraction: No language or time restrictions were placed on the electronic searches. Randomized controlled trials and open trials involving humans were here included and analyzed. The references of published articles identified in the initial search process were also examined for any additional studies appropriate for the review. DATA SYNTHESIS: SAMe is an important physiologic compound, playing a central role as precursor molecule in several biochemical reactions. Numerous studies have shown that SAMe may affect the regulation of various critical components of monoaminergic neurotransmission involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. Some findings have suggested its antidepressant efficacy in treating MDD. Several randomized controlled trials have supported that the antidepressant efficacy of SAMe in monotherapy is superior to placebo and tricyclic antidepressants. Recent findings have also demonstrated its efficacy in patients nonresponsive to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Overall, SAMe is a well-tolerated medication, which may offer considerable advantages as an alternative to antidepressant drugs or as an add-on therapy in the treatment of MDD and TRD. More large-scale controlled trials are needed to gain a better understanding of the relative efficacy of this drug.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"De Berardis D ; Orsolini L ; Serroni N ; Girinelli G ; Iasevoli F ; Tomasetti C ; de Bartolomeis A ; Mazza M ; Valchera A ; Fornaro M ; Perna G ; Piersanti M ; Di Nicola M ; Cavuto M ; Martinotti G ; Di Giannantonio M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1871527314666150821103825 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*psychology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic/methods\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/administration & dosage\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"De Berardis D, Orsolini L, Serroni N, Girinelli G, Iasevoli F, Tomasetti C, de Bartolomeis A, Mazza M, Valchera A, Fornaro M, Perna G, Piersanti M, Di Nicola M, Cavuto M, Martinotti G, and Di Giannantonio M (2016) A comprehensive review on the efficacy of S-Adenosyl-L-methionine in Major Depressive Disorder..

Previous evidence has revealed that the mesocorticolimbic circuitry, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and mesolimbic dopamine (DA) pathway are particularly susceptible to THC-induced pathologic alterations, including dysregulation of DAergic activity states, loss of PFC GABAergic inhibitory control and affective and cognitive abnormalities. There are currently limited pharmacological intervention strategies capable of preventing THC-induced neuropathological adaptations. l-Theanine is an amino acid analog of l-glutamate and l-glutamine derived from various plant sources, including green tea leaves. l-Theanine has previously been shown to modulate levels of GABA, DA, and glutamate in various neural regions and to possess neuroprotective properties. Using a preclinical model of adolescent THC exposure in male rats, we report that l-theanine pretreatment before adolescent THC exposure is capable of preventing long-term, THC-induced dysregulation of both PFC and VTA DAergic activity states, a neuroprotective effect that persists into adulthood. In addition, pretreatment with l-theanine blocked THC-induced downregulation of local GSK-3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) and Akt signaling pathways directly in the PFC, two biomarkers previously associated with cannabis-related psychiatric risk and subcortical DAergic dysregulation. Finally, l-theanine powerfully blocked the development of both affective and cognitive abnormalities commonly associated with adolescent THC exposure, further demonstrating functional and long-term neuroprotective effects of l-theanine in the mesocorticolimbic system.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT With the increasing trend of cannabis legalization and consumption during adolescence, it is essential to expand knowledge on the potential effects of adolescent cannabis exposure on brain development and identify potential pharmacological strategies to minimize Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-induced neuropathology. Previous evidence demonstrates that adolescent THC exposure induces long-lasting affective and cognitive abnormalities, mesocorticolimbic dysregulation, and schizophrenia-like molecular biomarkers that persist into adulthood. We demonstrate for the first time that l-theanine, an amino acid analog of l-glutamate and l-glutamine, is capable of preventing long-term THC side effects. l-Theanine prevented the development of THC-induced behavioral aberrations, blocked cortical downregulation of local GSK-3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) and Akt signaling pathways, and normalized dysregulation of both PFC and VTA DAergic activity, demonstrating powerful and functional neuroprotective effects against THC-induced developmental neuropathology.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"De Felice M ; Renard J ; Hudson R ; Szkudlarek HJ ; Pereira BJ ; Schmid S ; Rushlow WJ ; Laviolette SR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1050-20.2020 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnxiety/prevention & control/psychology\r\nCerebral Cortex/*drug effects\r\nCognition Disorders/*chemically induced/*prevention & control/psychology\r\nDronabinol/*toxicity\r\nGlutamates/*pharmacology\r\nGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3/drug effects\r\nHallucinogens/*toxicity\r\nMale\r\nMood Disorders/*chemically induced/*prevention & control/psychology\r\nNerve Net/*drug effects\r\nNeurons/*drug effects\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology\r\nOncogene Protein v-akt/drug effects\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/drug effects\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nVentral Tegmental Area/drug effects\r\nTHC\r\nadolescence\r\ncognition\r\ndopamine\r\nl-theanine\r\nmesocorticolimbic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"De Felice M, Renard J, Hudson R, Szkudlarek HJ, Pereira BJ, Schmid S, Rushlow WJ, and Laviolette SR (2021) l-Theanine Prevents Long-Term Affective and Cognitive Side Effects of Adolescent Δ-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol Exposure and Blocks Associated Molecular and Neuronal Abnormalities in the Mesocorticolimbic Circuitry..

Current treatments are believed to be more effective against manic symptoms, leaving a shortfall in recovery during the depressive phase of the illness. The current study draws on recent evidence suggesting that, in addition to increased oxidative load, alterations in mitochondrial function occur in bipolar disorder. METHODS: This 16-week study aims to explore the potential benefits of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) alone or in combination (CT) with selected nutraceuticals believed to enhance mitochondrial function. The study includes adults diagnosed with bipolar disorder currently experiencing an episode of depression. Participants are asked to take NAC, CT, or placebo in addition to any usual treatments. A post-discontinuation visit is conducted 4 weeks following the treatment phase. RESULTS: The primary outcome of the study will be mean change on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes include functioning, substance use, mania ratings, and quality of life. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and week 16 to explore biochemical alterations following treatment. CONCLUSION: This study may provide a novel adjunctive treatment for bipolar depression. Analysis of biological samples may assist in understanding the therapeutic benefits and the underlying etiology of bipolar depression.

We sought to prospectively study the effects of levodopa (LD) and/or methylphenidate (MPH) in combination with physiotherapy on mood and cognition following stroke in human subjects. METHODS: Ischemic stroke patients were enrolled in our study 15 to 180 days after stroke onset. The patients were randomized into four medication groups (MPH, LD, MPH + LD, or placebo) and received a 15-day course of medication therapy (1 dose daily) and 45-min standard physiotherapy treatment daily. Mood and cognitive function were assessed at the study onset and 15, 90 and 180 days after study enrollment. RESULTS: The strongest improvement of mood and cognition was found between baseline and the first follow-up immediately after the intervention. A significant improvement in mood was also found in the combined treatment group (MPH + LD) at 90 and 180 days, compared to the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: A 15-day course of daily MPH + LD combined with physiotherapy over a 3-week period was safe and significantly improved mood status in ischemic stroke patients. Future studies are needed which determine the optimal therapeutic window for and dosage of psychostimulants as well as identify those stroke patients who might benefit the most from treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Delbari A ; Salman-Roghani R ; Lokk J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000329275 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAnalysis of Variance\r\nAntiparkinson Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nCentral Nervous System Stimulants/*therapeutic use\r\nCognition Disorders/etiology/*therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLevodopa/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMethylphenidate/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMood Disorders/etiology/*therapy\r\nNeuropsychological Tests\r\n*Physical Therapy Modalities\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nStroke/complications\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Delbari A, Salman-Roghani R, and Lokk J (2011) Effect of methylphenidate and/or levodopa combined with physiotherapy on mood and cognition after stroke: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial..

The gaussian curve of initial L-TP concentrations changed into a bimodal distribution during treatment. The patients with initially lower L-TP levels also had lower L-TP levels during the treatment, thus forming the low-concentration group within the bimodal distribution. In the patients with higher initial concentrations, the L-TP levels increased to a much greater degree, forming the high-concentration group. Patients in this group needed a larger number of ECT's, probably owing to L-TP's property of shortening the seizure duration.

In several clinical trials, SAMe showed antidepressant activity. OBJECTIVE: Two multicenter studies were conducted in patients with a diagnosis of major depressive episode [baseline score on the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) >or=18] to confirm the efficacy and safety of SAMe in the treatment of major depression. In the first study (MC3), 1600 mg SAMe/d was given orally; whereas, in the second study (MC4), 400 mg SAMe/d was given intramuscularly. In both studies, the effects of SAMe were compared with those of 150 mg imipramine/d given orally in a double-blind design. DESIGN: In MC3, 143 patients received oral SAMe and 138 patients received imipramine for 6 wk. In MC4, 147 patients received SAMe intramuscularly and 148 patients received imipramine for 4 wk. In both studies the 2 main efficacy measures were the final HAM-D score and the percentage of responders to Clinical Global Impression at the endpoint. Secondary efficacy measures were the endpoint Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores and the percentage of responders, responders being those patients showing a decrease in HAM-D score of >or=50% from baseline. RESULTS: In both studies, the results of SAMe and imipramine treatment did not differ significantly for any efficacy measure. However, significantly fewer adverse events were observed in the patients treated with SAMe. CONCLUSIONS: The antidepressive efficacy of 1600 mg SAMe/d orally and 400 mg SAMe/d intramuscularly is comparable with that of 150 mg imipramine/d orally, but SAMe is significantly better tolerated.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Delle Chiaie R; Pancheri P ; Scapicchio P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/ajcn/76/5.1172S ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/administration & dosage/adverse \r\n      effects/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nImipramine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & \r\n      derivatives/*therapeutic use\r\nSafety\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Delle Chiaie R, Pancheri P, and Scapicchio P (2002) Efficacy and tolerability of oral and intramuscular S-adenosyl-L-methionine 1,4-butanedisulfonate (SAMe) in the treatment of major depression: comparison with imipramine in 2 multicenter studies..

Novel therapies are, therefore, required. It was shown by recent preclinical and clinical studies that the dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission might be involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. Furthermore, neuroimmune alterations could have a significant role in the pathogenesis of MDD. Vitamin D is a neurosteroid hormone essential for several metabolic processes, immune responses, and for regulating neurotrophic-neuroprotective processes, neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Recent studies have also shown Vitamin D deficiency in patients with severe psychiatric disorders, including MDD. Lately, clinical studies have shown the neuroprotective action of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) through the modulation of inflammatory pathways and via the modulation of synaptic release of glutamate in cortico-subcortical brain regions; the cysteine-glutamate antiporter. This paper reviews the therapeutic use of Vitamin D and NAC and among individuals with refractory MDD to the first- line pharmacological interventions, reviewing the clinical studies published in the last decade. A detailed summary of the current evidence in this area aims to better inform psychiatrists and general practitioners on the potential benefits of Vitamin D and NAC supplementation for this disorder. Nutraceutical supplementation with Vitamin D and NAC in treatment-resistant MDD patients may be important not only for improving depressive clinical manifestations but also for their safety and tolerability profile. This is of great interest, especially considering the need for treating special populations affected by MDD, such as youngsters and elders. Finally, the nutraceutical approach represents a good choice, considering its better compliance by the patients compared to traditional psychopharmacological treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"di Michele F ; Talamo A ; Niolu C ; Siracusano A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1381612826666200406090051 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine\r\nAged\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nHumans\r\nVitamin D\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nN-acetyl cysteine\r\nglutamate\r\ninflammation\r\nnutraceutical supplementation\r\nvitamin D.","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"di Michele F, Talamo A, Niolu C, and Siracusano A (2020) Vitamin D and N-Acetyl Cysteine Supplementation in Treatment-Resistant Depressive Disorder Patients: A General Review..

Eleven patients completed the study, and 10 had at least a 50% improvement on the 17-point Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS). One patient did not improve. Two patients prematurely terminated participation in the study because of increased anxiety. One patient experienced mild nausea, and another two patients developed mild diarrhea, which resolved spontaneously. The mean HDS score before treatment was 27.09 +/- 6.04 (mean +/- standard deviation) and was 9.55 +/- 7.29 after SAM treatment (p < 0.0001).

The main objective was to determine if a novel pharmacotherapy, D-cycloserine (DCS), enhanced the efficacy of the psychotherapy. Pre-clinical studies suggest that when fear extinction occurs during DCS administration, neuroplasticity may be enhanced. VRE therapy is a particularly promising format to test the hypothesis that DCS enhances extinction learning, as sensory fear cues are standardized across patients. In a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 100 mg of DCS or placebo was administered 90 min before each weekly VRE session, to ensure peak plasma concentrations during the sessions in 25 patients with chronic PTSD. The primary outcome measure was the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Secondary outcome measures included the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2. Assessments occurred at pre-treatment, following sessions 3, 6, 10, post-treatment, and at 6 months. The difference in CAPS between the VRE-DCS (n=13) and VRE-placebo (n=12) groups increased over time beginning at 6 weeks, with medium to large between-group effect sizes immediately post-treatment and 6 months later (d=0.68 and d=1.13, respectively). A similar pattern was observed for depression, anger expression, and sleep. PTSD remission rates were significantly greater for the VRE-DCS group (46% vs 8% at post-treatment; 69% vs 17% at 6 months). Patients in the VRE-DCS group showed earlier and greater improvement in PTSD symptoms compared with the VRE-placebo group. These results suggest a promising new treatment for PTSD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Difede J ; Cukor J ; Wyka K ; Olden M ; Hoffman H ; Lee FS ; Altemus M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/npp.2013.317 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAnger/drug effects\r\nChemotherapy, Adjuvant\r\nChronic Disease\r\nCycloserine/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/drug therapy/therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nExtinction, Psychological/drug effects\r\nFear/drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\n*Implosive Therapy\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPilot Projects\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nSleep/drug effects\r\nStress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*drug therapy/*therapy\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Difede J, Cukor J, Wyka K, Olden M, Hoffman H, Lee FS, and Altemus M (2014) D-cycloserine augmentation of exposure therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder: a pilot randomized clinical trial..

Postpartum blues (PPB) is often a prodromal state for postpartum depression (PPD), with severe PPB strongly associated with an elevated risk for PPD. The most common complication of childbearing, PPD has a prevalence of 13%, but there are no widespread prevention strategies, and no nutraceutical interventions have been developed. To counter the effects of the 40% increase in monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) levels that occurs during PPB, a dietary supplement kit consisting of monoamine precursor amino acids and dietary antioxidants was created. Key ingredients (tryptophan and tyrosine) were shown not to affect their total concentration in breast milk. The aim of this open-label study was to assess whether this dietary supplement reduces vulnerability to depressed mood at postpartum day 5, the typical peak of PPB. Forty-one healthy women completed all study procedures. One group (n = 21) received the dietary supplement, composed of 2 g of tryptophan, 10 g of tyrosine, and blueberry juice with blueberry extract. The control group (n = 20) did not receive any supplement. PPB severity was quantitated by the elevation in depressed mood on a visual analog scale following the sad mood induction procedure (MIP). Following the MIP, there was a robust induction of depressed mood in the control group, but no effect in the supplement group [43.85 ± 18.98 mm vs. 0.05 ± 9.57 mm shift; effect size: 2.9; F(1,39) = 88.33, P < 0.001].

Five TR-MDD outpatients who had previously not responded to at least four different antidepressant medication trials were initiated on 300 mg/day of nefazodone, 7.5 mg/day of pindolol and 1 g/day of tryptophan. Pindolol doses remained the same throughout the 20 weeks, while tryptophan and nefazodone dosages were gradually increased to 8 g/day and 450 mg/day, respectively. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) was used to evaluate outcome. By week 4, all cases demonstrated at least 50% decrease in HAM-D scores. At the end of the trial, the group mean HAM-D score had significantly decreased from 26.8 (+/- 1.9) to 1.8 (+/- 0.8) (p < 0.001). No significant adverse effects were reported. These results suggest that if serotonin availability and release is further enhanced by tryptophan in the presence of nefazodone and pindolol, an antidepressant effect may be produced in patients who are otherwise treatment-resistant.

It has been proposed that drugs that change nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) activity can affect mood- and anxiety-related behaviors. Also, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is closely associated with the pathophysiology of these disorders. To limit the potential adverse effects of alteration in cholinergic and nitric oxide (NO) systems, we investigated the combined efficacy of subthreshold doses of nAChR antagonist mecamylamine and NO ligands (L-arginine as agonist and l-NAME as an antagonist) on depression- and anxiety-related behaviors in male NMRI mice. Depression-related behaviors using the forced swim test (FST) and anxiety-like activity using the hole-board test were assessed. In our results, mecamylamine (3 mg/kg) showed antidepressant-like properties, and it also tended to have anxiolytic-like effects, though not significant. Concomitant treatment of subthreshold doses of mecamylamine (1 mg/kg) and l-arginine (25 mg/kg), l-NAME (1 mg/kg), or l-arginine/L-NAME were antidepressive. In contrast, l-arginine/L-NAME alone or in associated with mecamylamine showed anxiogenic-like efficacy. Isobolographic analysis exhibited an additive antidepressant effect of the combined subthreshold doses of mecamylamine and l-arginine, and a synergistic antidepressant effect of the combined subthreshold doses of mecamylamine and l-NAME. It should be noted that mecamylamine (3 mg/kg) elicited hypolocomotion. Our results suggest that mecamylamine produces a better antidepressant efficacy in combination with l-NAME than with l-arginine.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ebrahimi-Ghiri M ; Mohammadi-Mahdiabadi-Hasani MH ; Nasehi M ; Zarrindast MR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2020.112604 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnimals, Outbred Strains\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology\r\nAnxiety/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nArginine/metabolism/pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nCholinergic Agents/pharmacology\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination/methods\r\nMale\r\nMecamylamine/metabolism/*pharmacology\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nNG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester/metabolism/*pharmacology\r\nNicotinic Antagonists/pharmacology\r\nNitric Oxide/metabolism\r\nNitric Oxide Synthase/drug effects/metabolism\r\nReceptors, Nicotinic/drug effects/metabolism\r\nAnxiety\r\nDepression\r\nMice\r\nNicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)\r\nNitric oxide (NO) agents","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ebrahimi-Ghiri M, Mohammadi-Mahdiabadi-Hasani MH, Nasehi M, and Zarrindast MR (2020) Better antidepressant efficacy of mecamylamine in combination with L-NAME than with L-arginine..

The depression was treated first with desipramine and later with trazodone. The dyskinesia improved significantly on both drugs. The response of the dyskinesias to antidepressant medication may be due to the fact that antidepressants decrease beta-adrenoreceptor sensitivity and density which in turn may result in a diminished release of dopamine since beta-adrenoceptors mediate the noradrenaline-stimulated release of dopamine.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"el-Awar M ; Freedman M ; Seeman P ; Goldenberg L ; Little J ; Solomon P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy\r\nDesipramine/therapeutic use\r\nDyskinesia, Drug-Induced/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nLevodopa/*adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nParkinson Disease, Secondary/*chemically induced/drug therapy\r\nTrazodone/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"el-Awar M, Freedman M, Seeman P, Goldenberg L, Little J, and Solomon P (1987) Response of tardive and L-dopa-induced dyskinesias to antidepressants..

These conditions are associated with dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota, intestinal hyperpermeability and an increase in circulating markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. They are also associated with a deregulation of the glutamine-glutamate-γ-aminobutyric acid cycle, with impairment of the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain. Our aim was to examine the impact of chronic treatment with the probiotic organism Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG, alone or in combination with glutamine and curcumin, in a validated model of anxiety-depressive disorder in mice. Six-month-old mice (n=144) were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) stimulation for 3 weeks and emotional disturbances were assessed using two tests assessing anxiety (elevated plus maze test) and depressive-like behaviour (tail suspension test). After discontinuation of CUMS, mice were force-fed once-daily with curcumin, glutamine and probiotic alone or in combination for 21 consecutive days. Emotional reactivity was assessed in two separate behavioural tests: open field test and forced swim test. The outcomes of the interventions were compared with those induced by acute intraperitoneal administration of clomipramine, one of the major tricyclic antidepressants used in humans. Two independent sets of experiment were performed in this study, in order to evaluate the effects of two different formulations based on the utilisation of the probiotic L. rhamnosus GG in its live or inactivated form. CUMS led to an impairment of the emotional state of 6-month-old mice. However, chronic treatment with a combination of glutamine, curcumin and L. rhamnosus GG rescued the anxiety and depressive-like phenotype with an efficiency similar to clomipramine. A synergistic effect of the three compounds was observed, suggesting that simultaneous action on different targets is a relevant approach for the management of anxiety-depressive disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Faucher P ; Dries A ; Mousset PY ; Leboyer M ; Dore J ; Beracochea D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3920/BM2021.0188 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nClomipramine\r\n*Curcumin/pharmacology\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\n*Depressive Disorder\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nGlutamine\r\nHumans\r\nInfant\r\n*Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus\r\nMice\r\n*Probiotics\r\nStress, Psychological/drug therapy/psychology\r\nanxiety\r\ndepression\r\ngut-brain axis\r\nmicrobiota","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Faucher P, Dries A, Mousset PY, Leboyer M, Dore J, and Beracochea D (2022) Synergistic effects of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG, glutamine, and curcumin on chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depression in a mouse model..

It has been recently postulated that SAMe may increase the dopaminergic tone in depressed patients. Since dopamine inhibits both thyrotropin (TSH) and prolactin secretion, we investigated the effects of treatment with SAMe on the TSH and prolactin response to thyrotropin-releasing-hormone (TRH) stimulation in 7 depressed outpatient women (mean age: 46.1 +/- 7.2 years) and 10 depressed outpatient men (mean age: 38.0 +/- 10.0 years) participating in a six-week open study of oral SAMe in the treatment of major depression. At the end of the study, there was a significant reduction after treatment with SAMe in the response of both prolactin and TSH to TRH stimulation in the group of depressed men compared to pre-treatment values. On the other hand, in the group of depressed women, the posttreatment prolactin response to TRH did not appear to change when compared to pre-treatment and the TSH response to TRH challenge tended even to augment slightly after treatment with SAMe. Our results, at least in depressed men, seem to support the hypothesis of a stimulating effect of SAMe on the dopaminergic system.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fava M ; Rosenbaum JF ; MacLaughlin R ; Falk WE ; Pollack MH ; Cohen LS ; Jones L ; Pill L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/0022-3956(90)90057-w ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAdult\r\n*Antidepressive Agents\r\nBrain/drug effects\r\nDepressive Disorder/blood/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nProlactin/*blood\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nReceptors, Dopamine/*drug effects\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/*administration & dosage\r\nSingle-Blind Method\r\nThyrotropin/*blood\r\nThyrotropin-Releasing Hormone","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fava M, Rosenbaum JF, MacLaughlin R, Falk WE, Pollack MH, Cohen LS, Jones L, and Pill L (1990) Neuroendocrine effects of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, a novel putative antidepressant..

DATA SOURCES: A computerized literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, SciELO, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge. No year or country restrictions were used. The Boolean terms used for the electronic database search were (NAC OR N-acetylcysteine OR acetylcysteine) AND (depression OR depressive OR depressed) AND (trial). The last search was performed in November 2014. STUDY SELECTION: The literature was searched for double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials using N-acetylcysteine for depressive symptoms regardless of the main psychiatric condition. Using keywords and cross-referenced bibliographies, 38 studies were identified and examined in depth. Of those, 33 articles were rejected because inclusion criteria were not met. Finally, 5 studies were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted independently by 2 investigators. The primary outcome measure was change in depressive symptoms. Functionality, quality of life, and manic and anxiety symptoms were also examined. A full review and meta-analysis were performed. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated. RESULTS: Five studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis, providing data on 574 participants, of whom 291 were randomized to receive N-acetylcysteine and 283 to placebo. The follow-up varied from 12 to 24 weeks. Two studies included subjects with bipolar disorder and current depressive symptoms, 1 included subjects with MDD in a current depressive episode, and 2 included subjects with depressive symptoms in the context of other psychiatric conditions (1 trichotillomania and 1 heavy smoking). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine improved depressive symptoms as assessed by Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale when compared to placebo (SMD = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.55; P < .001). Subjects receiving N-acetylcysteine had better depressive symptoms scores on the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale at follow-up than subjects on placebo (SMD = 0.22; 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.41; P < .001). In addition, global functionality was better in N-acetylcysteine than in placebo conditions. There were no changes in quality of life. With regard to adverse events, only minor adverse events were associated with N-acetylcysteine (OR = 1.61; 95% CI = 1.01 to 2.59; P = .049). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of N-acetylcysteine ameliorates depressive symptoms, improves functionality, and shows good tolerability.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fernandes BS ; Dean OM ; Dodd S ; Malhi GS ; Berk M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.15r09984 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/*therapeutic use\r\nActivities of Daily Living/*classification/*psychology\r\nDepressive Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*psychology\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fernandes BS, Dean OM, Dodd S, Malhi GS, and Berk M (2016) N-Acetylcysteine in depressive symptoms and functionality: a systematic review and meta-analysis..

The influences of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on neuroinflammation associated depression-like behavior have not been investigated yet, and associated biochemical changes are currently unclear. Therefore, we assessed the effects of NAC on neuroinflammation associated depression-like behavior induced through chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in rats. The antidepressant-like effect of NAC was depicted using the sucrose preference test and the forced swimming test (FST) while CUMS-induced alteration in the locomotor index was measured using the open field test (OFT) and actophotometer. Our results revealed that CUMS exposure markedly aggravated depression-like behavior, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and reduced the serotonin levels. One-week consecutive NAC (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, p.o., a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) treatment significantly increased sucrose preference index, reduced immobility time in the FST, and the increased the number of squares crossed, number of rearing in the OFT and locomotion in the actophotometer in the CUMS-exposed rats. Moreover, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus as well as pre-frontal cortex were suppressed, and remarkably restored the serotonin levels by NAC (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, p.o.) administration. However, NAC (25 mg/kg, p.o.) exerted insignificant protection against CUMS-induced depressive-like behavior and associated neuro-inflammation. This study demonstrates that NAC exhibited the antidepressant-like effect in the CUMS-exposed rats, which might be mediated by anti-inflammatory potential and restoring serotonergic responses in the stressed rats.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fernandes J ; Gupta GL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2019.02.025 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/metabolism/*pharmacology\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nCytokines/metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFluoxetine/pharmacology\r\nHippocampus/metabolism\r\nInflammation/drug therapy\r\nMale\r\nNeuroimmunomodulation/drug effects\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nStress, Physiological\r\nStress, Psychological\r\nChronic unpredictable mild stress\r\nCytokines\r\nInterleukin-1β\r\nInterleukin-6\r\nN-acetylcysteine\r\nNeuroinflammation associated depressive behavior\r\nTumor necrosis factor-α","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fernandes J, and Gupta GL (2019) N-acetylcysteine attenuates neuroinflammation associated depressive behavior induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress in rat..

At baseline total HAM-D score was greater in patients with IPD. Overall, BPRS score did not differ between the two groups; however, patients with IPD scored higher on anxiety items of the BPRS, and patients with MSA had higher scores on the item indicating blunted affect. After levodopa, both groups improved significantly in UPDRS and HAM-D total scores (just significant for patients with MSA). Patients with IPD improved significantly in total BPRS score but patients with MSA did not. At baseline patients with IPD were more depressed and anxious than patients with MSA who, by contrast, showed blunted affect. After levodopa, depression and anxiety of patients with IPD improved significantly whereas the affective detachment of patients with MSA did not change. Major neuronal loss in the caudate and ventral striatum, which are part of the lateral orbitofrontal and limbic circuits, may be responsible for the blunted affect not responsive to levodopa therapy found in patients with MSA.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fetoni V ; Soliveri P ; Monza D ; Testa D ; Girotti F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1136/jnnp.66.4.541 ","Keywords":"Antiparkinson Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/diagnosis/etiology/prevention & control\r\nHumans\r\nLevodopa/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMood Disorders/diagnosis/etiology/*prevention & control\r\nMultiple System Atrophy/complications/*drug therapy\r\nParkinson Disease/complications/*drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fetoni V, Soliveri P, Monza D, Testa D, and Girotti F (1999) Affective symptoms in multiple system atrophy and Parkinson's disease: response to levodopa therapy..

DATA SOURCES: The majority of information was obtained from primary published literature identified through MEDLINE search (1966-February 2001). Information was also obtained through secondary and tertiary sources when available. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All articles identified from data sources were evaluated and all relevant information included in this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: The majority of clinical trial evidence surrounds the application of SAMe for various depressive disorders, osteoarthrits, and fibromyalgia. Sample sizes of these trials and the dose employed have varied considerably. Several reviews and at least two meta-analyses have examined the available evidence surrounding SAMe in the therapy of depression for trials completed prior to 1994 and concluded that SAMe was superior to placebo in treating depressive disorders and approximately as effective as standard tricyclic antidepressants. Much of this information exists in the form of isolated case reports or solitary clinical trials. SAMe appears to be well tolerated, with the majority of adverse effects presenting as mild to moderate gastrointestinal complaints. However, it is apparent that this agent is not without risk of more significant psychiatric and cardiovascular adverse events. Information documenting drug or food interactions with SAMe is very limited. CONCLUSIONS: Consumers should be instructed to avoid unmonitored consumption of this dietary supplement until sufficient discussion has taken place with their primary healthcare provider. Although there exists significant potential for therapeutic application of SAMe, its uncertain risk profile precludes definitive recommendation at this time. Healthcare providers and consumers should likely temper their enthusiasm for this dietary supplement until sufficient information becomes available.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fetrow CW ; Avila JR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1345/aph.1Z443 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nContraindications\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy\r\nDiet\r\n*Dietary Supplements/adverse effects\r\nDrug Interactions\r\nFibromyalgia/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nOsteoarthritis/drug therapy\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fetrow CW, and Avila JR (2001) Efficacy of the dietary supplement S-adenosyl-L-methionine..

In the present study, we combined bilateral olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) with a variety of procedures of intravenous cocaine self-administration and extinction/reinstatement in rats. We also investigated the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on rewarding and seeking behaviors for cocaine in OBX rats and compared the drug's effects in sham-operated control animals (SHAM). The occurrence of depressive symptoms before introduction to cocaine self-administration enhanced subsequent cocaine-seeking behaviors but did not significantly influence cocaine's rewarding properties or extinction training. NAC (25-100mg/kg) given acutely or repeatedly did not alter the co-occurrence of cocaine reward and depression but effectively reduced the cocaine-seeking behavior observed in both phenotypes. Our results indicate that depression behavior is linked to more pronounced drug craving and a higher propensity to relapse in rats. We also show the lack of efficacy of repeated NAC treatment on SHAM or OBX animals in terms of cocaine self-administration, while the drug was an effective blocker of cocaine-seeking behavior in both studied phenotypes, with a more pronounced drug effect observed in OBX animals. The last finding demonstrates the potential clinical utility of NAC to reduce cocaine seeking enhanced by co-existing depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Frankowska M ; Jastrzębska J ; Nowak E ; Białko M ; Przegaliński E ; Filip M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2014.02.044 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAnimals\r\nCocaine/*administration & dosage\r\nConditioning, Operant/drug effects\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDopamine Uptake Inhibitors/*administration & dosage\r\nDrug-Seeking Behavior/*drug effects\r\nExtinction, Psychological/drug effects\r\nFree Radical Scavengers/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nOlfactory Bulb/surgery\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\n*Reward\r\nSelf Administration\r\nBulbectomy\r\nCocaine\r\nDepression\r\nN-acetylcysteine\r\nSeeking-behavior\r\nSelf-administration","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Frankowska M, Jastrzębska J, Nowak E, Białko M, Przegaliński E, and Filip M (2014) The effects of N-acetylcysteine on cocaine reward and seeking behaviors in a rat model of depression..

Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) treatments are widely used, accessible, and understudied for well-defined psychiatric indications. Women are more likely than men to both suffer from MDD and use CAM. METHODS: A PubMed/Medline search was conducted to assess the evidence base for commonly utilized CAM treatments, MDD, and perinatal depression. RESULTS: Among CAM treatments, omega-3 fatty acids have received the most specific study in terms of epidemiological, preclinical, and clinical research for perinatal depression. Three randomized placebo-controlled trials have been conducted in which investigators assessed omega-3 fatty acids vs. placebo for perinatal depression, with conflicting results. CAM interventions that can be easily added to a treatment plan with little risk and general health benefits for most women include omega-3 fatty acids, exercise, and folate, although data are insufficient at this time to recommend any of these as monotherapy for perinatal depression. S-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe) and bright light therapy may be reasonable to consider based on the evidence in MDD. St. John's Wort requires further study with regard to safety in pregnancy, and drug interactions can be a potential problem. DISCUSSION: Further study is required to elucidate the role of CAM treatments for perinatal depression, and the clinical context of perinatal depression requires safe, effective, and accessible treatment options.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Freeman MP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2008.06.017 ","Keywords":"Acupuncture Therapy\r\nComplementary Therapies/*methods\r\nDepression, Postpartum/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHerbal Medicine\r\nHumans\r\nHypericum/chemistry\r\nPhototherapy\r\nPhytotherapy/methods\r\nPlant Extracts/therapeutic use\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Freeman MP (2009) Complementary and alternative medicine for perinatal depression..

PARTICIPANTS: Authors of this report were invited participants in the American Psychiatric Association's Task Force on Complementary and Alternative Medicine. EVIDENCE: The group reviewed the literature on individual CAM treatments for MDD, methodological considerations, and future directions for CAM in psychiatry. Individual CAM treatments were reviewed with regard to efficacy in MDD, as well as risks and benefits. Literature searches included MEDLINE and PsycINFO reviews and manual reference searches; electronic searches were limited to English-language publications from 1965 to January 2010 (but manual searches were not restricted by language). Treatments were selected for this review on the basis of (1) published randomized controlled trials in MDD and (2) widespread use with important clinical safety or public health significance relevant to psychiatric practice. An action plan is presented based on needs pertaining to CAM and psychiatry. CONSENSUS PROCESS: Consensus was reached by group conferences. Written iterations were drafted and sent out among group members prior to discussion, resolution of any differences of interpretation of evidence, and final approval. CONCLUSIONS: A review of randomized controlled trials for commonly used CAM treatments such as omega-3 fatty acids, St John's wort (Hypericum), folate, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), acupuncture, light therapy, exercise, and mindfulness psychotherapies revealed promising results. More rigorous and larger studies are recommended. Each CAM treatment must be evaluated separately in adequately powered controlled trials. At this time, several CAM treatments appear promising and deserve further study. The greatest risk of pursuing a CAM therapy is the possible delay of other well-established treatments. Clinical, research, and educational initiatives designed to focus on CAM in psychiatry are clearly warranted due to the widespread use of CAM therapies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Freeman MP ; Fava M ; Lake J ; Trivedi MH ; Wisner KL ; Mischoulon D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.10cs05959blu ","Keywords":"Acupuncture Therapy\r\nAdvisory Committees\r\nComplementary Therapies/*methods\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nHerbal Medicine\r\nHumans\r\nHypericum\r\nMeditation/methods\r\nMethionine/therapeutic use\r\nPhototherapy\r\nPsychiatry/methods\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nUnited States","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Freeman MP, Fava M, Lake J, Trivedi MH, Wisner KL, and Mischoulon D (2010) Complementary and alternative medicine in major depressive disorder: the American Psychiatric Association Task Force report..

STUDY SELECTION: We selected RCTs for MDD that included validated diagnostic assessment and baseline/outcome measures of illness severity. Assessment was limited to widely used CAM agents most frequently studied in RCTs with pill placebo: St John's wort, omega-3 fatty acids, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe). DATA SYNTHESIS: Of eligible publications, 173 reported results of 1 trial, and 5 included > 1 trial, representing a total of 185 RCTs. Patient variables, including illness severity, were similar across CAM and antidepressant RCTs, except for a higher proportion of women in CAM studies (P = .0003). Random-effects meta-analysis indicated that both antidepressant and CAM monotherapy resulted in superior response rates compared with placebo. Placebo-response rates were significantly lower for patients enrolled in CAM versus antidepressant RCTs (P = .002). Meta-regression analyses yielded no significant differences in the relative risk of prematurely discontinuing therapy due to any reason between active treatment and placebo for antidepressant and CAM RCTs, although discontinuation due to adverse events was higher in antidepressant RCTs compared to CAM RCTs (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Participants in CAM trials were more likely to be female and to have a lower placebo-response rate compared to those in standard antidepressant trials for MDD. Trials of standard antidepressants and CAM therapies were composed of patients with similar depression severity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Freeman MP ; Mischoulon D ; Tedeschini E ; Goodness T ; Cohen LS ; Fava M ; Papakostas GI ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.10r05976blu ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nComplementary Therapies/*methods/standards\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nPlacebos\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use\r\nSample Size\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Freeman MP, Mischoulon D, Tedeschini E, Goodness T, Cohen LS, Fava M, and Papakostas GI (2010) Complementary and alternative medicine for major depressive disorder: a meta-analysis of patient characteristics, placebo-response rates, and treatment outcomes relative to standard antidepressants..

It is of fundamental importance in a number of biochemical reactions involving enzymatic transmethylation, contributing to the synthesis, activation and/or metabolism of such compounds as hormones, neurotransmitters, nucleic acids, proteins, phospholipids and certain drugs. The administration of a stable salt of SAMe, either orally or parenterally, has been shown to restore normal hepatic function in the presence of various chronic liver diseases (including alcoholic and non-alcoholic cirrhosis, oestrogen-induced and other forms of cholestasis), to prevent or reverse hepatotoxicity due to several drugs and chemicals such as alcohol, paracetamol (acetaminophen), steroids and lead, and to have antidepressant properties. In all of these studies SAMe has been very well tolerated, a finding of great potential benefit given the well-known adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants with which it has been compared in a few trials. Thus, with its novel mechanisms of action and good tolerability, SAMe is an interesting new therapeutic agent in several diverse disease conditions, but its relative value remains to be determined in appropriate comparisons with other treatment modalities in current use.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Friedel HA ; Goa KL ; Benfield P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2165/00003495-198938030-00004 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nHumans\r\nLiver Diseases/drug therapy\r\nMood Disorders/drug therapy\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Friedel HA, Goa KL, and Benfield P (1989) S-adenosyl-L-methionine.

Herein, we report the improvement of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia through the adjustment of L-dopa treatment in a 78-year-old woman with probable DLB. Her marked mood swings were improved by changing L-dopa administration from three to five times per day while maintaining the same total daily dosage. This observation suggests that there may be an association between plasmatic L-dopa levels and mood fluctuation in patients with DLB. This pharmacological approach may be useful in the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia without the use of antipsychotic agents to avoid severe neuroleptic sensitivity, which is one of the suggestive clinical features in the Third Consortium on DLB clinical criteria.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fujishiro H ; Kasanuki K ; Nakamura S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/psyg.12025 ","Keywords":"Affect/drug effects\r\nAged\r\nComorbidity\r\nDopamine Agents/administration & dosage/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nLevodopa/administration & dosage/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nLewy Body Disease/blood/*drug therapy/*epidemiology\r\nMood Disorders/blood/*drug therapy/*epidemiology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nBPSD\r\nParkinson's disease\r\ndementia\r\ndopamine\r\npharmacotherapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fujishiro H, Kasanuki K, and Nakamura S (2013) Levodopa treatment and mood fluctuation in dementia with Lewy bodies: a case report..

Selective inhibitors of serotonin uptake, which enhance serotonergic function by preventing the removal of serotonin from the synaptic cleft via the membrane transporter, have been introduced for the treatment of depression and may be effective in other disorders. Precursor loading can increase serotonin concentrations in the synaptic cleft, and tryptophan--which has been available in health food stores and drug stores--had become increasingly used for self-medication of depression, insomnia, and premenstrual syndrome. Conversion to serotonin is not the major metabolic pathway for tryptophan, and large increases in other tryptophan metabolites (such as quinolinic acid, a substance that is excitotoxic at high concentrations) accompany small increases in extracellular serotonin. The recent epidemic of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with tryptophan now appears due to a trace contaminant in the product from a single manufacturer. A major advance in serotonin pharmacology has been the elucidation of serotonin receptor heterogeneity. At least seven receptor subtypes (5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4) have been identified in brain. Direct-acting agonists and antagonists can have selective affinity for specific receptor subtypes. Selective activation of 5-HT1A receptors seems to cause anxiolytic and possibly antidepressive effects. Selective antagonists of 5-HT2 or 5-HT3 receptors may be useful in treating anxiety and schizophrenia. Drugs that enhance serotonergic function suppress aggression in animals, but the specific receptor subtypes involved are not known. The advances being made in serotonin pharmacology will help define the role of this brain neurotransmitter in psychiatric and other disorders and can be expected to lead to further therapeutic advances.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fuller RW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Aggression/psychology\r\nAnimals\r\nAnti-Anxiety Agents/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nPremenstrual Syndrome/drug therapy\r\nReceptors, Serotonin/drug effects/physiology\r\nSelf Medication\r\nSerotonin/*physiology\r\nSleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/drug therapy\r\nTryptophan/pharmacology/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fuller RW (1991) Role of serotonin in therapy of depression and related disorders..

Opposite changes in mood, such as mania or depression, have been reported after surgery, but it is not known whether these side effects are specifically related to STN DBS. To learn whether STN DBS also influences the limbic loop, we investigated acute subjective psychotropic effects related to levodopa or bilateral STN DBS. After a median postoperative follow-up of 12 months, 50 PD patients completed the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI), assessing subjective psychotropic effects in four conditions: off-drug/on-stimulation; off-drug/off-stimulation; on-drug/off-stimulation; and on-drug/on-stimulation. Both levodopa and STN DBS improved all the ARCI subscales, indicating subjective feelings of well being, euphoria, increase in motivation, and decrease in fatigue, anxiety, and tension. A suprathreshold dose of levodopa was significantly more effective than STN DBS, using the same electrical parameters as for chronic stimulation, on four of the five ARCI subscales. We concluded that 1) both STN DBS and levodopa have synergistic acute beneficial psychotropic effects in PD, 2) the psychotropic effects of both treatments need to be considered in the long-term management of chronic STN DBS, and 3) the results indicate an involvement of the limbic STN in mood disorders of PD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Funkiewiez A ; Ardouin C ; Krack P ; Fraix V ; Van Blercom N ; Xie J ; Moro E ; Benabid AL ; Pollak P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/mds.10441 ","Keywords":"Activities of Daily Living\r\nAged\r\nAntiparkinson Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nCognition Disorders/diagnosis/physiopathology\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis\r\nElectric Stimulation Therapy/*instrumentation\r\nFemale\r\nFrontal Lobe/physiopathology\r\nFunctional Laterality\r\nHumans\r\nLevodopa/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNeuropsychological Tests\r\nParkinson Disease/drug therapy/psychology/*therapy\r\nPsychological Tests\r\nPsychomotor Disorders/*diagnosis\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSubthalamic Nucleus/*physiology\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nTime","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Funkiewiez A, Ardouin C, Krack P, Fraix V, Van Blercom N, Xie J, Moro E, Benabid AL, and Pollak P (2003) Acute psychotropic effects of bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation and levodopa in Parkinson's disease..

Effects of both treatments on cognition and affective status are less well understood. Motor, cognitive, and affective symptoms may relate to the dysfunctioning of parallel cortico-striatal loops. The aim of this study was to assess cognition, behavior, and mood, with and without both treatments in the same group of PD patients. A group of 22 nondemented PD patients was included in this study. Patients were tested twice before surgery (off and on levodopa) and twice 3 months after surgery (OFF and ON STN stimulation, off levodopa). Cognitive and affective effects of STN stimulation and levodopa had some common, but also different, effects. STN stimulation improved performance on the planning test, associated with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. However, the treatments had opposite effects on tests associated with the orbitofrontal cortex; specifically, levodopa impaired while STN stimulation improved performance on the extinction phase of a reversal/extinction task. Acutely, both treatments improved motivation and decreased fatigue and anxiety. On chronic treatment (3 months after surgery), depression improved, whereas apathy worsened 3 months after surgery. To conclude, there were significant but contrasting effects of levodopa and STN stimulation on cognition and affective functions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Funkiewiez A ; Ardouin C ; Cools R ; Krack P ; Fraix V ; Batir A ; Chabardès S ; Benabid AL ; Robbins TW ; Pollak P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/mds.21029 ","Keywords":"Affect/*drug effects/*physiology\r\nAntiparkinson Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nCerebral Cortex/drug effects/physiopathology\r\nCognition/*drug effects/*physiology\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nCorpus Striatum/drug effects/physiopathology\r\n*Deep Brain Stimulation\r\nDepressive Disorder/physiopathology/therapy\r\nExtinction, Psychological/drug effects/physiology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLevodopa/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMotivation\r\nNeural Pathways/drug effects/physiopathology\r\nNeurologic Examination/drug effects\r\nNeuropsychological Tests\r\nProblem Solving/drug effects/physiology\r\nReversal Learning/drug effects/physiology\r\nSubthalamic Nucleus/*physiopathology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Funkiewiez A, Ardouin C, Cools R, Krack P, Fraix V, Batir A, Chabardès S, Benabid AL, Robbins TW, and Pollak P (2006) Effects of levodopa and subthalamic nucleus stimulation on cognitive and affective functioning in Parkinson's disease..

Given the implication of certain nutrients in the onset of bipolar disorder, it has been hypothesized that nutraceuticals might be effective in improving symptoms of the condition (i.e. mania or depression). Our systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of adjunctive nutraceuticals compared to placebo. METHODS: We searched the following databases from inception to February 2019: Web of Science, CINAHL, Embase, and PsycINFO. We included only original randomized controlled trials written in English, testing the efficacy of nutraceuticals in add-on to standard care, compared to placebo, in patients with bipolar disorder. RESULTS: After identifying 6584 potentially relevant publications, we finally included 25 studies, among which six used fatty acids, seven micronutrients, seven amino acids. One study tested probiotics, while in four trials a combination of different types of nutraceuticals was used. Even if some compounds have shown promising results (i.e. fatty acids and N-acetyl cysteine for depression, amino acid drinks and folic acid for mania), the majority of nutraceuticals did not cause significant improvements in comparison to placebo. LIMITATIONS: We could not perform a meta-analysis due to the high heterogeneity of trials, which were also affected by some methodological caveats. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence regarding the efficacy of adjunctive nutraceuticals in bipolar disorder is inconsistent. Nevertheless, they appear generally free from relevant side effects. Well-designed trials are needed to further explore the potential role of nutraceuticals in different mood episodes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fusar-Poli L ; Surace T ; Vanella A ; Meo V ; Patania F ; Furnari R ; Signorelli MS ; Aguglia E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2019.04.039 ","Keywords":"Amino Acids/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/psychology/*therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMicronutrients/*therapeutic use\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nDepression\r\nFatty acids\r\nMania\r\nNutraceuticals\r\nSystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fusar-Poli L, Surace T, Vanella A, Meo V, Patania F, Furnari R, Signorelli MS, and Aguglia E (2019) The effect of adjunctive nutraceuticals in bipolar disorder: A systematic review of randomized placebo-controlled trials..

There is evidence in the literature that S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe), a naturally occurring compound in the human body, has antidepressant efficacy. This product may be an important addition to the armamentarium of antidepressant agents. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of SAMe in comparison with placebo or antidepressants for the treatment of depression in adults. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Specialised Register (CCMDCTR Studies and Reference Register), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, international trial registers ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization trials portal (ICTRP). We checked reference lists, performed handsearching and contacted experts in the field. The CCMDCTR literature search was last updated on 5 February 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing SAMe with placebo or antidepressants in adults with a diagnosis of major depression. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently performed extraction of data and assessment of risk of bias. We contacted trialists of included studies for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: This systematic review included eight trials comparing SAMe with either placebo, imipramine, desipramine or escitalopram. We accepted trials that used SAMe as monotherapy or as add-on therapy to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and we accepted both oral and parenteral administration. The review involved 934 adults, of both sexes, from inpatient and outpatient settings.The trials were at low risk of reporting bias. We judged the risk of selection, performance, detection and attrition bias as unclear or low, and one study was at high risk of attrition bias.There was no strong evidence of a difference in terms of change in depressive symptoms from baseline to end of treatment between SAMe and placebo as monotherapy (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.54 to 0.46; P = 0.29; 142 participants; 2 studies; very low quality evidence). There was also no strong evidence of a difference in terms of drop-out rates due to any reason between SAMe and placebo, when used as monotherapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.29; P = 0.52; 142 participants; 2 studies; low quality evidence).Low quality evidence showed that the change in depressive symptoms from baseline to end of treatment was similar between SAMe and imipramine, both as monotherapy (SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.27; P = 0.82; 619 participants; 4 studies). There was also no strong evidence of a difference between SAMe and a tricyclic antidepressant in terms of drop-outs due to any reason (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.31; P = 0.2; 78 participants; 3 studies; very low quality evidence).There was little evidence of a difference in terms of change in depressive symptoms from baseline to end of treatment between SAMe and escitalopram, both as monotherapy (MD 0.12, 95% CI -2.75 to 2.99; P = 0.93; 129 participants; 1 study; low quality evidence). There was no strong evidence of a difference between SAMe and escitalopram in terms of drop-outs due to any reason (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.16; P = 0.26; 129 participants; 1 study; low quality evidence).There was low quality evidence that SAMe is superior to placebo as add-on to SSRIs in terms of change in depressive symptoms from baseline to end of treatment (MD -3.90, 95% CI -6.93 to -0.87; P = 0.01; 73 participants; 1 study). There was no strong evidence of a difference between SAMe and placebo as adjunctive therapy to an SSRI in terms of drop-outs due to any reason (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.56; P = 0.38; 73 participants; 1 study; very low quality evidence).For all comparisons, secondary outcome measures of response and remission rates were consistent with these primary outcome measures.With regard to all extractable measures of the acceptability of SAMe, the quality of the evidence was low to very low. SAMe was not different from placebo and established antidepressants. The exception was that compared to imipramine, fewer participants experienced troublesome adverse effects when treated with parenteral SAMe.The specific adverse effects were not detailed in most of the included studies. There were two reports of mania/hypomania recorded for 441 participants in the SAMe arm. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Given the absence of high quality evidence and the inability to draw firm conclusions based on that evidence, the use of SAMe for the treatment of depression in adults should be investigated further. Future trials should be in the form of large randomised controlled clinical trials of high methodological quality, with particular attention given to randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding and the handling of missing data. Comparator antidepressants from all classes should be used. Adverse events should be detailed for each participant, bearing in mind that induction of mania is of particular interest.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Galizia I ; Oldani L ; Macritchie K ; Amari E ; Dougall D ; Jones TN ; Lam RW ; Massei GJ ; Yatham LN ; Young AH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD011286.pub2 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nCitalopram/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nImipramine/therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/*therapeutic use\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Galizia I, Oldani L, Macritchie K, Amari E, Dougall D, Jones TN, Lam RW, Massei GJ, Yatham LN, and Young AH (2016) S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) for depression in adults..

Chronic stress is a risk factor for development of depression, anxiety and deterioration of cognitive performance. Compelling evidences indicate an involvement of nitric oxide (NO) pathway in these disorders. Hence, investigation of the beneficial effects of agmatine on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression, anxiety and cognitive performance with the involvement of nitrergic pathway was undertaken. Mice were subjected to a battery of stressors for 28days. Agmatine (20 and 40mg/kg, i.p.) alone and in combination with NO modulators like L-NAME (15mg/kg, i.p.) and l-arginine (400mg/kg i.p.) were administered daily. The results showed that 4-weeks CUMS produces significant depression and anxiety-like behaviour. Stressed mice have also shown a significant high serum corticosterone (CORT) and low BDNF level. Chronic treatment with agmatine produced significant antidepressant-like behaviour in forced swim test (FST) and sucrose preference test, whereas, anxiolytic-like behaviour in elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field test (OFT) with improved cognitive impairment in Morris water maze (MWM). Furthermore, agmatine administration reduced the levels of acetylcholinesterase and oxidative stress markers. In addition, agmatine treatment significantly increased the BDNF level and inhibited serum CORT level in stressed mice. Treatment with L-NAME (15mg/kg) potentiated the effect of agmatine whereas l-arginine abolished the anxiolytic, antidepressant and neuroprotective effects of agmatine. Agmatine showed marked effect on depression and anxiety-like behaviour in mice through nitrergic pathway, which may be related to modulation of oxidative-nitrergic stress, CORT and BDNF levels.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gawali NB ; Bulani VD ; Gursahani MS ; Deshpande PS ; Kothavade PS ; Juvekar AR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.brainres.2017.03.004 ","Keywords":"Agmatine/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAnimals\r\nAnti-Anxiety Agents/pharmacology\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology\r\nAnxiety/drug therapy/etiology/metabolism\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nChronic Disease\r\nCognition Disorders/drug therapy\r\nCognitive Dysfunction\r\nCorticosterone/blood\r\nDepression/drug therapy/etiology\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy\r\nHippocampus/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMaze Learning/drug effects\r\nMice\r\nNG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester/metabolism/pharmacology\r\nSignal Transduction/drug effects\r\nStress, Psychological/metabolism\r\nAgmatine\r\nAnxiety\r\nBDNF\r\nCUMS\r\nDepression\r\nHPA axis","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gawali NB, Bulani VD, Gursahani MS, Deshpande PS, Kothavade PS, and Juvekar AR (2017) Agmatine attenuates chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced anxiety, depression-like behaviours and cognitive impairment by modulating nitrergic signalling pathway..

Tyrosine administration to animals increases rates at which brain neurons synthesise both dopamine and noradrenaline.1-4 Oral administration of an aqueous solution of tyrosine, 100 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg in a single dose, to normal volunteers resulted in significant, dose-related increases in both plasma tyrosine concentrations and the ratio of the concentration of tyrosine to the concentrations of\nother large neutral aminoacids (LNAA). This ratio determines tyrosine uptake in the brain.6 Similarly, tyrosine administered in aqueous solution at a total daily dose of 100 mg/kg, divided into three separate portions over the course of a day, significantly increased plasma tyrosine and the tyrosine: LNAA ratio. 7 In neither these human studies nor in experiments in normal rats8 did tyrosine ever raise the blood pressure; thus it seems unlikely that tyrosine\nadministration increases blood tyramine levels.\nWe treated a depressed woman with tyrosine, 100 mg/kg/day, in three daily doses. Tyrosine was administered as 500 mg tablets. The patient’s plasma tyrosine 2 h after a tyrosine dose had approximately doubled, and a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial suggested that her depression responded favourably to tyrosine therapy.  \n We believe that orally administered tyrosine can raise plasma tyrosine concentrations and the plasma tyrosine: LNAA ratio. There is also or reason to believe that this may lead to increased cerebral catecholamine synthesis, which might benefit patients with certain disease states, such as depression.

Until recently, all drugs used to treat depression appeared to enhance neurotransmission in one or both of these systems, which was used to explain their antidepressant actions (Gelenberg and Klerman, 1978). In fact, it was this action of antidepressants that gave rise to the models of depression. Another way to increase brain levels of NE and 5-HT, and potentially to increase presynaptic activity, would be the systemic administration of the precursors of the neurotransmitters, an approach something like organic gardening in the brain. For this purpose, the 5-HT precursors tryptophan and 5-hydroxtryptophan (5-HTP), and the NE precursors tyrosine and dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), have been administered to depressed patients. This paper reviews some of the theoretical background and clinical experience with the precursor strategy, focusing primarily on work with L-tyrosine. All four precursors as possible antidepressants have been recently reviewed (Gelenberg, 1982).","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gelenberg AJ ; Gibson CJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/026010618400300305 ","Keywords":"5-Hydroxytryptophan/metabolism\r\nAdult\r\nAnimals\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDihydroxyphenylalanine/therapeutic use\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMethoxyhydroxyphenylglycol/urine\r\nTryptophan/metabolism\r\nTyrosine/blood/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gelenberg AJ, and Gibson CJ (1984) Tyrosine for the treatment of depression..

SAMe is essential for the synthesis of polyamines, which have a key role in protein synthesis, cell proliferation, and neuronal plasticity. On the other hand, accumulating data indicate that depression is associated with a reduction in regional brain volume and that antidepressants increase neurogenesis in defined brain regions and also influence neuronal plasticity. Here we show that in a validated rat model of depression (chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced anhedonia) there is a significant reduction of putrescine, spermidine and spermine in the hippocampus, and of only putrescine in the nucleus accumbens septi. SAMe, at a fully antidepressant dose (300 mg/kg i.m., daily for 7 days), completely restores the levels of putrescine in the nucleus accumbens, and restores in part the levels of both spermidine and spermine in the hippocampus. These results may suggest (i) a role for brain polyamines in depression and in reward processes, and (ii) that the antidepressant effect of SAMe may be due, at least in part, to a normalization of putrescine levels in the nucleus accumbens septi.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Genedani S ; Saltini S ; Benelli A ; Filaferro M ; Bertolini A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00001756-200112210-00017 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology\r\nBiogenic Polyamines/*metabolism\r\nBrain Chemistry/drug effects\r\nChronic Disease\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/*metabolism\r\nDietary Sucrose/pharmacology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nEating/drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nHippocampus/metabolism\r\nNucleus Accumbens/metabolism\r\nRats\r\nRats, Inbred Strains\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/*pharmacology\r\nStress, Physiological/drug therapy/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Genedani S, Saltini S, Benelli A, Filaferro M, and Bertolini A (2001) Influence of SAMe on the modifications of brain polyamine levels in an animal model of depression..

METHODS: The therapeutic effects of light versus tryptophan on SAD were studied in a repeated measures design in 13 SAD patients (11 women, 2 men). Light therapy for 2 weeks or tryptophan for 4 weeks was given, separated by a one week washout period. All were assessed with the modified Hamilton Depression Rating scale (SIGH-SAD) at the beginning and end of each treatment. RESULTS: Four (31%) of the patients did not respond to either therapy. Four tryptophan-resistant patients responded to light therapy, while one light therapy-resistant patient responded to tryptophan. Relapse occurred rapidly after stopping light therapy but not after stopping tryptophan therapy. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant therapeutic effects of both light (p = 0.012) and tryptophan (p = 0.014) on SAD, which were not significantly different from each other. There may be a time difference between the residual pharmacokinetic effects after stopping therapy. LIMITATIONS: The groups studied were small. This was an open study. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Tryptophan was equally effective to light therapy in treating SAD, but relapse after withdrawal of tryptophan probably occurs more slowly.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ghadirian AM ; Murphy BE ; Gendron MJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0165-0327(98)00053-6 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\n*Phototherapy\r\nSeasonal Affective Disorder/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nTryptophan/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ghadirian AM, Murphy BE, and Gendron MJ (1998) Efficacy of light versus tryptophan therapy in seasonal affective disorder..

This review examines the evidence that serotonin-related genotypes may moderate the behavioural effects of supplementation with the serotonin precursor amino acid l-tryptophan (TRP), on which synthesis of serotonin (or 5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) depends. However, 95 % of serotonin is synthesised and used in the periphery, and TRP is also metabolised via non-5-HT routes such as the kynurenine pathway. Moreover, understanding of genotypes involved in regulation of serotonin raises questions over the generalisability of TRP effects on behaviour across individuals with varied serotonergic genotypes. To date, only differences between variants of the 5-HT transporter-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR) have been investigated in relation to behavioural effects of TRP supplementation. Effects of 5-HTTLPR genotypes are usually compared between the alleles that are either high (L/L') or low (S/S') expressing of mRNA for the 5-HT transporter receptor. Yet, another key genetic variable is sex: in women, the S/S' genotype predicts sensitivity to improved mood and reduced cortisol by TRP supplementation, during stressful challenges, whereas the L/L' genotype protects against stress-induced mood deterioration. In men, the L/L' genotype may confer risk of stress-induced increases in negative affect; there are insufficient data to assess effects on male S/S' genotypes. However, better-powered studies to detect sex by genotype by stress by TRP interactions, as well as consideration of more genotypes, are needed before strong conclusions and recommendations for behavioural effects of TRP treatment can be reached.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gibson EL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S0029665117004451 ","Keywords":"Affect/drug effects\r\nAlleles\r\nBehavior\r\nDepression/drug therapy/*genetics\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFemale\r\n*Genetic Variation\r\n*Genotype\r\nHumans\r\nHydrocortisone/blood\r\nMale\r\nReceptors, Serotonin/genetics\r\nSerotonin/blood/*genetics\r\nStress, Psychological/drug therapy/*genetics\r\nTryptophan/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\n5-HT 5-hydroxytryptamine\r\n5-HTTLPR 5-HT transporter-linked promoter region\r\nATD acute tryptophan depletion\r\nCNS central nervous systems\r\nCSF cerebrospinal fluid\r\nLNAA large neutral amino acids\r\nMAO monoamine oxidase\r\nTDO tryptophan 2\r\nTPH TRP hydroxylase\r\nTRP l-tryptophan\r\n3-dioxygenase\r\n5-HT transporter-linked promoter region\r\nGenetic polymorphism\r\nSerotonin and behaviour\r\nStress\r\nTryptophan supplementation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gibson EL (2018) Tryptophan supplementation and serotonin function: genetic variations in behavioural effects..

The dosages were equal to those found to be therapeutic in parkinson's disease. Changes in cerebrospinal fluid, urinary catecholamine and indoleamine metabolites, and cortical evoked potential measurements suggest that l-dopa altered catecholamines both in the brain and the periphery. An antidepressant therapeutic response was observed in only 4 of the ss. All ss who responded had retarded depressions; none of the ss with agitated depressions improved. Substitution of a placebo led to relapses into depression in 3 of the 4 responders. A consistent induction of hypomania or mania in all 5 of the depressed patients who had a prior history of mania suggests that catecholamines, especially dopamine, may be directly involved in the genesis or triggering of manic behavior in susceptible individuals.

METHODS: PubMed, PsycInfo and Central were searched for meta-analyses of randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) until 30 June 2018. Outcomes included depression severity, response, remission, relapse and adverse events. The quality of evidence was assessed according to Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) considering the methodological quality of the RCTs and meta-analyses, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision of the evidence and the potential risk of publication bias. RESULTS: The literature search revealed 26 meta-analyses conducted between 2002 and 2018 on 1-49 RCTs in major, minor and seasonal depression. In patients with mild to moderate major depression, moderate quality evidence suggested the efficacy of St. John's wort towards placebo and its comparative effectiveness towards standard antidepressants for the treatment for depression severity and response rates, while St. John's wort caused significant less adverse events. In patients with recurrent major depression, moderate quality evidence showed that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy was superior to standard antidepressant drug treatment for the prevention of depression relapse. Other CAM evidence was considered as having low or very low quality. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of all but two CAM treatments found in studies on clinical depressed patients based on low to very low quality of evidence. The evidence has to be downgraded mostly due to avoidable methodological flaws of both the original RCTs and meta-analyses not following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

METHODS: We embarked on a 12-week clinical trial of NAC (2000 mg/day compared with placebo) as an adjunctive treatment for unipolar depression. A follow-up visit was conducted 4 weeks following the completion of treatment. We collected serum samples at baseline and the end of the treatment phase (week 12) to determine changes in interleukin-6 (IL6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) following NAC treatment. RESULTS: NAC treatment significantly improved depressive symptoms on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) over 16 weeks of the trial. Serum levels of IL6 were associated with reductions of MADRS scores independent of treatment response. However, we found no significant changes in IL6, CRP and BDNF levels following NAC treatment. CONCLUSION: Overall, this suggests that our results failed to support the hypothesis that IL6, CRP and BDNF are directly involved in the therapeutic mechanism of NAC in depression. IL6 may be a useful marker for future exploration of treatment response.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hasebe K ; Gray L ; Bortolasci C ; Panizzutti B ; Mohebbi M ; Kidnapillai S ; Spolding B ; Walder K ; Berk M ; Malhi G ; Dodd S ; Dean OM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/neu.2017.2 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/*therapeutic use\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBiomarkers/blood\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*blood\r\nC-Reactive Protein/*analysis\r\nDepressive Disorder/blood/*drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInterleukin-6/*blood\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult\r\nN-acetylcysteine\r\nclinical trial\r\ndepression\r\ninflammation\r\nneurotrophic factor","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hasebe K, Gray L, Bortolasci C, Panizzutti B, Mohebbi M, Kidnapillai S, Spolding B, Walder K, Berk M, Malhi G, Dodd S, and Dean OM (2017) Adjunctive N-acetylcysteine in depression: exploration of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and brain-derived neurotrophic factor..

Reduced brain phosphocreatine levels have been shown to be lower in female methamphetamine users compared to males, and, of relevance, studies have demonstrated an association between treatment-resistant depression and reduced brain phosphocreatine concentrations. The nutritional supplement creatine monohydrate has been reported to reduce symptoms of depression in female adolescents and adults taking antidepressants, as well as to increase brain phosphocreatine in healthy volunteers. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was to investigate creatine monohydrate as a treatment for depression in female methamphetamine users. METHODS: Fourteen females with depression and comorbid methamphetamine dependence were enrolled in an 8-week open label trial of 5 g of daily creatine monohydrate and of these 14, 11 females completed the study. Depression was measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and brain phosphocreatine levels were measured using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy pre- and post-creatine treatment. Secondary outcome measures included anxiety symptoms, measured with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), as well as methamphetamine use, monitored by twice weekly urine drug screens and self-reported use. RESULTS: The results of a linear mixed effects repeated measures model showed significantly reduced HAMD and BAI scores as early as week 2 when compared to baseline scores. This improvement was maintained through study completion. Brain phosphocreatine concentrations were higher at the second phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan compared to the baseline scan; Mbaseline = 0.223 (SD = 0.013) vs. Mpost-treatment = 0.233 (SD = 0.009), t (9) = 2.905, p <.01, suggesting that creatine increased phosphocreatine levels. Also, a reduction in methamphetamine positive urine drug screens of greater than 50% was observed by week 6. Finally, creatine was well tolerated and adverse events that were related to gastrointestinal symptoms and muscle cramping were determined as possibly related to creatine. CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that creatine treatment may be a promising therapeutic approach for females with depression and comorbid methamphetamine dependence. This study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01514630).","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hellem TL ; Sung YH ; Shi XF ; Pett MA ; Latendresse G ; Morgan J ; Huber RS ; Kuykendall D ; Lundberg KJ ; Renshaw PF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15504263.2015.1100471 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAmphetamine-Related Disorders/*complications\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBrain/metabolism\r\nCreatine/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/complications/*drug therapy\r\nDiagnosis, Dual (Psychiatry)\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy\r\n*Methamphetamine\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPhosphocreatine/metabolism\r\nPilot Projects\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult\r\nco-occurring\r\ncomorbidity\r\ndepression\r\nmethamphetamine dependence\r\nneuroimaging\r\nsubstance use disorders\r\nwomen's health","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hellem TL, Sung YH, Shi XF, Pett MA, Latendresse G, Morgan J, Huber RS, Kuykendall D, Lundberg KJ, and Renshaw PF (2015) Creatine as a Novel Treatment for Depression in Females Using Methamphetamine: A Pilot Study..

The apparently rapid conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine, as reported from studies in animals, is consistent with the 20-30 min onset of effects seen in our study. Unipolar and bipolar depressed patients responded differently to the alterations in brain biogenic amines and also to the nonspecific stress of the experiment. Intravenous L-DOPA given acutely had effects on the AER that were similar to those documented with oral dopa given chronically--an augmentation of amplitude--intensity slopes in unipolar patients and a relative reduction of slopes in bipolar patients. In contrast, intravenous L-DOPA did not enhance verbal learning as did chronic oral treatment, but rather was associated with reduced learning compared with placebo infusions. Different neurochemical changes following L-DOPA given in single intravenous doses may be responsible for the different learning and behavioral changes form those found previously with oral dopa administered chronically.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Henry GM ; Buchsbaum M ; Murphy DL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00006842-197603000-00003 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nBehavior/*drug effects\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nCarbidopa/*administration & dosage/pharmacology\r\nCognition/drug effects\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nEmotions/drug effects\r\nEvoked Potentials/*drug effects\r\nHumans\r\nHydrazines/*administration & dosage\r\nInfusions, Parenteral\r\nLevodopa/*administration & dosage/pharmacology\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nPlacebos\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nTime Factors\r\nVerbal Learning/*drug effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Henry GM, Buchsbaum M, and Murphy DL (1976) Intravenous l-DOPA plus carbidopa in depressed patients: average evoked response, learning, and behavioral changes..

METHOD: Eleven treatment-resistant patients with chronic schizophrenia completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, six-week, randomly assigned, crossover treatment trial of 0.8 g/kg body weight/day of glycine, added to their prior antipsychotic treatment. RESULTS: Glycine was well tolerated, resulted in significantly increased serum glycine levels and induced a mean 36 (7%) reduction in negative symptoms (P < 0.0001). Significant improvements were also induced in depressive and cognitive symptoms.

The antibiotic drug d-cycloserine (DCS) acts as a partial agonist at the NMDAR-GLY site. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that at dosages >or=100 mg/day DCS acts as a functional NMDAR antagonist and may have antidepressant effects. METHODS: Twenty-two treatment resistant major depression patients participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week crossover trial with 250 mg/day DCS added to their ongoing antidepressant medications. RESULTS: DCS treatment was well tolerated and resulted in symptom reductions. However, biweekly-performed clinical assessments, including the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale did not reveal statistically significant therapeutic advantages of DCS vs. placebo adjuvant treatment. LIMITATIONS: Small sample, uneven treatment resistance criteria across subjects. The exposure to DCS (dose/length of treatment) may not have been sufficient.

D-cycloserine (DCS) is a partial agonist at the NMDAR-associated glycine modulatory site that at high doses acts as a functional NMDAR antagonist. Twenty-six treatment-resistant major depressive disorder patients participated in a double blind, placebo-controlled, 6-wk parallel group trial with a gradually titrated high dose (1000 mg/d) of DCS added to their antidepressant medication. DCS treatment was well tolerated, had no psychotomimetic effects and led to improvement in depression symptoms as measured by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD; p = 0.005) and Beck Depression Inventory (p = 0.046). Of the 13 subjects treated with DCS, 54% had a ≥ 50% HAMD score reduction vs. 15% of the 13 patients randomized to placebo (p = 0.039). A significant (p = 0.043) treatment× pre-treatment glycine serum levels interaction was registered. These findings indicate that NMDAR glycine site antagonism may be a cost-effective target for development of mechanistically novel antidepressants. Larger-sized DCS trials are warranted.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Heresco-Levy U ; Gelfin G ; Bloch B ; Levin R ; Edelman S ; Javitt DC ; Kremer I ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S1461145712000910 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nCycloserine/*administration & dosage\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*psychology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Resistance/drug effects/physiology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Heresco-Levy U, Gelfin G, Bloch B, Levin R, Edelman S, Javitt DC, and Kremer I (2013) A randomized add-on trial of high-dose D-cycloserine for treatment-resistant depression..

This study aimed to examine whether l-theanine is effective for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) in an open-label clinical trial. METHODS: Subjects were 20 patients with MDD (four males; mean age: 41.0±14.1 years, 16 females; 42.9±12.0 years). l-theanine (250 mg/day) was added to the current medication of each participant for 8 weeks. Symptoms and cognitive functions were assessed at baseline, 4, and 8 weeks after l-theanine administration by the 21-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Stroop test, and Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS). RESULTS: HAMD-21 score was reduced after l-theanine administration (p=0.007). This reduction was observed in unremitted patients (HAMD-21>7; p=0.004) at baseline. Anxiety-trait scores decreased after l-theanine administration (p=0.012) in the STAI test. PSQI scores also decreased after l-theanine administration (p=0.030) in the unremitted patients at baseline. Regarding cognitive functions, response latency (p=0.001) and error rate (p=0.036) decreased in the Stroop test, and verbal memory (p=0.005) and executive function (p=0.016) were enhanced in the BACS test after l-theanine administration. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that chronic (8-week) l-theanine administration is safe and has multiple beneficial effects on depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep disturbance and cognitive impairments in patients with MDD. However, since this is an open-label study, placebo-controlled studies are required to consolidate the effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hidese S ; Ota M ; Wakabayashi C ; Noda T ; Ozawa H ; Okubo T ; Kunugi H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/neu.2016.33 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnxiety/complications/drug therapy\r\nCognition/drug effects\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/complications/*drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nGlutamates/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMental Status Schedule\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nStroop Test\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nl-theanine\r\nanxiety\r\ncognitive function\r\ndepression\r\nsleep","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hidese S, Ota M, Wakabayashi C, Noda T, Ozawa H, Okubo T, and Kunugi H (2017) Effects of chronic l-theanine administration in patients with major depressive disorder: an open-label study..

Repeated administration of the serotonin precursor tryptophan has previously been shown to increase agreeable behavior and reduce quarrelsome behavior in irritable people, who are also considered at risk for depression. METHODS: To examine the effects of tryptophan on social functioning in individuals with a family history of depression, 40 men and women with at least one first-degree relative with depression received tryptophan (1g three times a day) and placebo for 14 days each in a double-blind crossover design and recorded their social behavior and mood during everyday interpersonal encounters. Participants also provided daily ratings of their positive and negative cognitions concerning their social functioning. RESULTS: Tryptophan improved mood. Unexpectedly, tryptophan increased quarrelsome behavior and reduced agreeable behavior, specifically during interactions at home. The behavioral effects of tryptophan were not moderated by mood or by the interaction partner. Negative social cognitions were lower when tryptophan was given second and lower during placebo when placebo was given second. CONCLUSION: Overall, tryptophan may not alter social behavior in individuals with a family history of depression as it does in irritable people. However, the behavioral effects of tryptophan at home might be seen as a way for individuals with a family history of depression to achieve more control. Over time, this may positively influence the way they feel and think about themselves in a social context.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hogenelst K ; Schoevers RA ; Aan Het Rot M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/ijnp/pyv012 ","Keywords":"Activities of Daily Living/psychology\r\nAdolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAffect/drug effects\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/*administration & dosage\r\nCognition/*drug effects\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFamily\r\nFemale\r\nGenetic Predisposition to Disease\r\nHousing\r\nHumans\r\n*Interpersonal Relations\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\n*Social Behavior\r\nTryptophan/*administration & dosage\r\nYoung Adult\r\ndysfunctional attitudes\r\nmajor depressive disorder\r\nmood\r\nserotonin\r\nsocial interaction","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hogenelst K, Schoevers RA, and Aan Het Rot M (2015) The Effects of Tryptophan on Everyday Interpersonal Encounters and Social Cognitions in Individuals with a Family History of Depression..

Glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in depression. However, it is unclear whether enhancement of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype glutamate receptor can be a treatment for depression. METHODS: We studied sarcosine, a glycine transporter-I inhibitor that potentiates NMDA function, in animal models and in depressed patients. We investigated its effects in forced swim test, tail suspension test, elevated plus maze test, novelty-suppressed feeding test, and chronic unpredictable stress test in rats and conducted a 6-week randomized, double-blinded, citalopram-controlled trial in 40 patients with major depressive disorder. Clinical efficacy and side effects were assessed biweekly, with the main outcomes of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Global Assessment of Function, and remission rate. The time course of response and dropout rates was also compared. RESULTS: Sarcosine decreased immobility in the forced swim test and tail suspension test, reduced the latency to feed in the novelty-suppressed feeding test, and reversed behavioral deficits caused by chronic unpredictable stress test, which are characteristics for an antidepressant. In the clinical study, sarcosine substantially improved scores of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression, and Global Assessment of Function more than citalopram treatment. Sarcosine-treated patients were much more likely and quicker to remit and less likely to drop out. Sarcosine was well tolerated without significant side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that enhancing NMDA function can improve depression-like behaviors in rodent models and in human depression. Establishment of glycine transporter-I inhibition as a novel treatment for depression waits for confirmation by further proof-of-principle studies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Huang CC ; Wei IH ; Huang CL ; Chen KT ; Tsai MH ; Tsai P ; Tun R ; Huang KH ; Chang YC ; Lane HY ; Tsai GE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.02.020 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/administration & dosage/pharmacology\r\nCitalopram/administration & dosage/pharmacology\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nGlycine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSarcosine/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety\r\nN-methyl-D-aspartate\r\nelevated plus maze\r\nforced swimming test\r\nglutamate\r\nsarcosine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Huang CC, Wei IH, Huang CL, Chen KT, Tsai MH, Tsai P, Tun R, Huang KH, Chang YC, Lane HY, and Tsai GE (2013) Inhibition of glycine transporter-I as a novel mechanism for the treatment of depression..

However, only one-third of patients respond adequately. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a major unmet need. Interestingly, elevating 5-HT(Ext) beyond what is achieved by a SERT inhibitor appears to treat TRD. Adjunctive administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) safely elevates 5-HT(Ext) beyond the SERT inhibitor effect in humans; however, 5-HTP cannot be a clinically viable drug because of its poor pharmacokinetics. A slow-release (SR) delivery mode would be predicted to overcome the pharmacokinetic limitations of 5-HTP, substantially enhancing the pharmacological action and transforming 5-HTP into a clinically viable drug. Animal studies bear out this prediction. Thus, adjunct 5-HTP SR could be an important new treatment for TRD. Here, we review the clinical and preclinical evidence for this treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jacobsen JPR ; Krystal AD ; Krishnan KRR ; Caron MG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.tips.2016.09.001 ","Keywords":"5-Hydroxytryptophan/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/*administration & \r\n      dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nHumans\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nSerotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/pharmacology\r\n5-hydroxytryptophan\r\nAntidepressant\r\ndepression\r\ntreatment-resistant depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jacobsen JPR, Krystal AD, Krishnan KRR, and Caron MG (2016) Adjunctive 5-Hydroxytryptophan Slow-Release for Treatment-Resistant Depression: Clinical and Preclinical Rationale..

The present randomized double blind study was undertaken to assess the role of l-5-HTP as an antidepressant and to compare its antidepressant efficacy with fluoxetine in first depressive episode patients of Indian population. METHODS: A total of 70 patients of first depressive episode, all of whom were diagnosed with ICD-10 criteria, were recruited but only 60 patients completed the study and were randomly divided into two groups, receiving l-5-HTP and fluoxetine, respectively, for a period of 8weeks. All patients were administered Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) to assess severity of depression at baseline, 2weeks, 4weeks and 8weeks. The efficacy of treatment was assessed by comparing HAM-D scores obtained at these examinations with the baseline examination; final evaluation of both efficacy and tolerance was assessed using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale at the end of study. RESULTS: Both treatment groups showed significant and nearly equal reduction in HAM-D scores beginning at week two and continuing through week eight. Twenty-two patients (73.33%) in the l-5-HTP group and 24 patients (80%) in the fluoxetine group showed positive response at the end of the study. CONCLUSION: l-5-HTP has definitely got antidepressant effect in patients of depression. Antidepressant effect was seen within 2weeks of treatment and was apparent in all degrees of depression. The therapeutic efficacy of l-5-HTP was considered as equal to that of fluoxetine.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jangid P ; Malik P ; Singh P ; Sharma M ; Gulia AK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ajp.2012.05.011 ","Keywords":"5-Hydroxytryptophan/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nAdult\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFluoxetine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jangid P, Malik P, Singh P, Sharma M, and Gulia AK (2013) Comparative study of efficacy of l-5-hydroxytryptophan and fluoxetine in patients presenting with first depressive episode..

As a serotonin precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan has long been used as a nonpharmacological treatment for depression. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the antidepressant effects of 5-hydroxytryptophan in depressed patients. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Google Scholar were searched from inception to May 2018. DATA EXTRACTION: Thirteen investigations were included in the systematic review (using PRISMA guidelines), and 7 in the full meta-analysis (pre-registered on PROSPERO: CRD42018104415). DATA ANALYSIS: Analyses revealed a depression remission rate of 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.78; remission rate [k] = 13), and this was confirmed by the questionnaire results, which revealed a large Hedges' g (1.11; 95%CI, 0.53-1.69). Methodological variability (in treatment duration, type of depression studied, experimental design, 5-hydroxytryptophan dosage) contributes to heterogeneity in the results (I2 = 76%, τ2 = 0.379). In addition, the OHAT (Office of Health Assessment and Translation risk of bias rating) tool suggested that, on the whole, current studies are relatively weak (few include placebo groups). CONCLUSION: Further trials should overcome these limitations by using placebo-controlled studies that include patients with well-defined depression diagnoses, along with strong characterization of psychological and physiological patient characteristics.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Javelle F ; Lampit A ; Bloch W ; Häussermann P ; Johnson SL ; Zimmer P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/nutrit/nuz039 ","Keywords":"5-Hydroxytryptophan/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nCohort Studies\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\n5-hydroxytryptophan\r\ndepression\r\ninclusion criteria\r\nmethod variability\r\nserotonin","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Javelle F, Lampit A, Bloch W, Häussermann P, Johnson SL, and Zimmer P (2020) Effects of 5-hydroxytryptophan on distinct types of depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis..

In our model, rats housed at moderate altitude (in hypobaric hypoxia) exhibit increased depression-like behavior, altered brain serotonin and a lack of antidepressant response to most selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A forebrain deficit in the bioenergetic marker creatine is noted in people living at altitude or with MDD. METHODS: Rats housed at 4500 ft were given dietary creatine monohydrate (CRMH, 4% w/w, 5 weeks) vs. un-supplemented diet, and impact on depression-like behavior, brain bioenergetics, serotonin and SSRI efficacy assessed. RESULTS: CRMH significantly improved brain creatine in a sex-based manner. At altitude, CRMH increased serotonin levels in the female prefrontal cortex and striatum but reduced male striatal and hippocampal serotonin. Dietary CRMH was antidepressant in the forced swim test and anti-anhedonic in the sucrose preference test in only females at altitude, with motor behavior unchanged. CRMH improved fluoxetine efficacy (20 mg/kg) in only males at altitude: CRMH + SSRI significantly improved male striatal creatine and serotonin vs. CRMH alone. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary CRMH exhibits sex-based efficacy in resolving altitude-related deficits in brain biomarkers, depression-like behavior and SSRI efficacy, and may be effective clinically for SSRI-resistant depression at altitude. This is the first study to link CRMH treatment to improving brain serotonin.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kanekar S ; Ettaro R ; Hoffman MD ; Ombach HJ ; Brown J ; Lynch C ; Sheth CS ; Renshaw PF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ijms22158195 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrain/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nCreatine/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nEnergy Metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nFluoxetine/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSerotonin/*metabolism\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/administration & \r\n      dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nSex Factors\r\nSSRI efficacy\r\naltitude\r\nanimal model of depression\r\nbrain bioenergetics\r\ndietary creatine\r\nfemale depression\r\nhypobaric hypoxia\r\nserotonin\r\nsex differences in depression\r\ntreatment-resistant depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kanekar S, Ettaro R, Hoffman MD, Ombach HJ, Brown J, Lynch C, Sheth CS, and Renshaw PF (2021) Sex-Based Impact of Creatine Supplementation on Depressive Symptoms, Brain Serotonin and SSRI Efficacy in an Animal Model of Treatment-Resistant Depression..

Previously, we found that C57BL/6J mice exhibit increased depression-like behavior during a short-day condition (SD) and have lowered brain serotonin (5-HT) content. This study analyzed the effect of bright light on depression-like behaviors and the brain serotonergic system using the C57BL/6J mice. In the mice maintained under SD, bright light treatment (1000 lx, daily 1 h exposure) for 1 week reduced immobility time in the forced swimming test and increased intake of saccharin solution in a saccharin intake test. However, the light treatment did not modify 5-HT content and selective 5-HT uptake in the amygdala, or temporal patterns of core body temperature and wheel-running activity throughout a day. In the next experiment, we attempted to enhance the effect of bright light by using L-serine, a precursor of D-serine that acts as an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor coagonist. Daily subcutaneous injection of L-serine for 2 weeks prior to the bright light strongly reduced the immobility time in the forced swimming test, suggesting a synergistic effect of light and L-serine. Furthermore, bright light increased the total number of 5-HT-immunoreactive cells and cells that had colocalized 5-HT and c-Fos immunosignals in several subregions of the raphe nuclei. These effects were potentiated by prior injection of L-serine. These data suggest that the bright light may elicit an antidepressant-like effect via enhanced 5-HT signals in the brain and L-serine can enhance these effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kawai M ; Goda R ; Otsuka T ; Iwamoto A ; Uotsu N ; Furuse M ; Yasuo S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.brainresbull.2015.08.010 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBrain/drug effects\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFluoxetine/pharmacology\r\nLight\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nPhototherapy/*methods\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nSeasonal Affective Disorder/drug therapy/metabolism/*therapy\r\nSerine/*pharmacology\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/pharmacology\r\nDepression-like behavior\r\nMouse\r\nRaphe nuclei\r\nSeasonal affective disorder\r\nSerotonin\r\nc-Fos","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kawai M, Goda R, Otsuka T, Iwamoto A, Uotsu N, Furuse M, and Yasuo S (2015) Antidepressant-like effect of bright light is potentiated by L-serine administration in a mouse model of seasonal affective disorder..

Only 15-20% of patients require hospitalisation, most of them because their depression has proved resistant to therapy. To overcome therapy-resistance, the following methods of treatment are available: In therapy-resistant endogenous and psychogenic depressions, mono-infusion therapy is the treatment of choice; it can also be administered on an out-patient basis. In extremely intractable cases, it is advisable to resort to combined infusion therapy, preceded by five days of relaxation therapy with oral doses of a neuroleptic, and possibly reinforced by medication with 5-hydroxytryptophan (the precursor of serotonin) or by sleep deprival. In therapy-resistant cases of so-called masked depression, marked by overtones of anxiety and hypochondriasis, infusions of maprotiline are indicated, because this anti-depressant exerts a relaxing and mildly anxiolytic action, has a stabilising influence on the autonomic nervous system, and produces a mood-brightening effect. In patients who are apathetic and devoid of drive and suffering from involutional depression or depression of old age, infusion therapy plus administration of an MAO inhibitor can be recommended. Combination of an antidepressant with a neuroleptic agent also displaying certain antidepressive properties is really indicated only in the rare cases of schizo-affective psychosis. Electroconvulsive therapy should be employed only as a last resort in extremely retarded and apathetic patients with strong suicidal tendencies, and the indication for ECT should be established with the utmost reserve.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kielholz P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000285154 ","Keywords":"5-Hydroxytryptophan/therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nAntipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/*therapy\r\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\r\nHumans\r\nInfusions, Intravenous\r\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/therapeutic use\r\nSleep Deprivation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kielholz P (1986) Treatment for therapy-resistant depression..

The normal stress (NS) group demonstrated decreased movement than the control (CON) group; movements in the CRE/TAU-treated group (particularly 0.15/0.5%) returned to the CON levels. Antidepressant effects of CRE/TAU mixtures were confirmed in a depressive mouse model induced by chronic mild stress. In behavioural assessments, movement and sucrose preference of the CRE/TAU group increased to a similar level as in the positive control group; hippocampal catecholamine and serotonin levels increased significantly. Stress-related hormones (adrenocorticotropic and corticotropin-releasing hormones) and inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) increased in the NS group but significantly decreased in the CRE/TAU-treated group. Brain signalling protein expression ratio of phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt)/Akt, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK)/ERK, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) significantly increased in the CRE/TAU-treated group. These results indicate that CRE/TAU-induced antidepressant effects are associated with increased behavioural patterns and downregulation of stress hormones and cytokines, mediated through Akt and ERK/BDNF pathways in vertebrate models.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kim S ; Hong KB ; Kim S ; Suh HJ ; Jo K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-020-68424-1 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nCatecholamines/analysis/metabolism\r\nCreatine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDown-Regulation/drug effects\r\nDrosophila melanogaster\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination/methods\r\nHippocampus/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism/pathology\r\nHumans\r\nMAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nProto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism\r\nSerotonin/analysis/metabolism\r\nStress, Psychological/complications\r\nTaurine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kim S, Hong KB, Kim S, Suh HJ, and Jo K (2020) Creatine and taurine mixtures alleviate depressive-like behaviour in Drosophila melanogaster and mice via regulating Akt and ERK/BDNF pathways..

There are significant regional variations in the rates of MDD and suicide in the United States, suggesting that sociodemographic and environmental conditions contribute. Here, we review epidemiological evidence that increases in the altitude of residence are linked to the increased risk of depression and suicide. We consider the possibility that chronic hypobaric hypoxia (low blood oxygen related to low atmospheric pressure) contributes to suicide and depression, which is suggested by animal models, short-term studies in humans, and the effects of hypoxic medical conditions on suicide and depression. We argue that hypobaric hypoxia could promote suicide and depression by altering serotonin metabolism and brain bioenergetics; both of these pathways are implicated in depression, and both are affected by hypoxia. Finally, we briefly examine treatment strategies to address hypoxia-related depression and suicidal ideation that are suggested by these findings, including creatine monohydrate and the serotonin precursors tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kious BM ; Kondo DG ; Renshaw PF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/HRP.0000000000000158 ","Keywords":"*Altitude\r\nCreatinine/*therapeutic use\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\n*Hypoxia/complications/epidemiology/metabolism\r\n*Residence Characteristics/statistics & numerical data\r\n*Suicide/statistics & numerical data\r\nTryptophan/*therapeutic use\r\nUnited States/epidemiology\r\n*Suicide Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kious BM, Kondo DG, and Renshaw PF (2018) Living High and Feeling Low: Altitude, Suicide, and Depression..

Conventional treatments are not effective for a significant proportion of patients and interventions that are often beneficial for treatment-refractory depression are not widely available. There is, therefore, an immense need to identify novel antidepressant strategies, particularly strategies that target physiological pathways that are distinct from those addressed by conventional treatments. There is growing evidence from human neuroimaging, genetics, epidemiology, and animal studies that disruptions in brain energy production, storage, and utilization are implicated in the development and maintenance of depression. Creatine, a widely available nutritional supplement, has the potential to improve these disruptions in some patients, and early clinical trials indicate that it may have efficacy as an antidepressant agent.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kious BM ; Kondo DG ; Renshaw PF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/biom9090406 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/pathology\r\nBrain/metabolism\r\nClinical Studies as Topic\r\nCreatine/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/pathology\r\nEnergy Metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nNutritional Support\r\nPhosphocreatine/metabolism\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ncreatine\r\nmajor depressive disorder\r\nphosphocreatine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kious BM, Kondo DG, and Renshaw PF (2019) Creatine for the Treatment of Depression..

Treatment resistance is common, and the illness burden is disproportionately borne by females. 31-Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P MRS) is a translational method for in vivo measurement of brain energy metabolites. METHODS: We recruited 5 female adolescents who had been on fluoxetine (Prozac®) for ≥ 8 weeks, but continued meet diagnostic criteria for MDD with a Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) raw score ≥ 40. Treatment response was measured with the CDRS-R. (31)P MRS brain scans were performed at baseline, and repeated following adjunctive creatine 4 g daily for 8 weeks. For comparison, 10 healthy female adolescents underwent identical brain scans performed 8 weeks apart. RESULTS: The mean CDRS-R score declined from 69 to 30.6, a decrease of 56%. Participants experienced no Serious Adverse Events, suicide attempts, hospitalizations or intentional self-harm. There were no unresolved treatment-emergent adverse effects or laboratory abnormalities. MDD participants' baseline CDRS-R score was correlated with baseline pH (p=0.04), and was negatively correlated with beta-nucleoside triphosphate (β-NTP) concentration (p=0.03). Compared to healthy controls, creatine-treated adolescents demonstrated a significant increase in brain Phosphocreatine (PCr) concentration (p=0.02) on follow-up (31)P MRS brain scans. LIMITATIONS: Lack of placebo control; and small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Further study of creatine as an adjunctive treatment for adolescents with SSRI-resistant MDD is warranted.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kondo DG ; Sung YH ; Hellem TL ; Fiedler KK ; Shi X ; Jeong EK ; Renshaw PF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2011.07.010 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nCreatine/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/chemically induced/drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nFluoxetine/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\r\n*Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy\r\nMagnetics\r\nPhosphocreatine/metabolism/therapeutic use\r\nPhosphorus/therapeutic use\r\nRadionuclide Imaging\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kondo DG, Sung YH, Hellem TL, Fiedler KK, Shi X, Jeong EK, and Renshaw PF (2011) Open-label adjunctive creatine for female adolescents with SSRI-resistant major depressive disorder: a 31-phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy study..

However their mutual interaction, if any, in regulation of depression remain largely unexplored. In the present study we explored the possible interaction between agmatine and neuropeptide Y in regulation of depression like behavior in forced swim test. We found that acute intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of agmatine (20-40μg/rat), NPY (5 and 10μg/rat) and NPY Y1 receptor agonist, [Leu(31), Pro(34)]-NPY (0.4 and 0.8ng/rat) dose dependently decreased immobility time in forced swim test indicating their antidepressant like effects. In combination studies, the antidepressant like effect of agmatine (10μg/rat) was significantly potentiated by NPY (1 and 5μg/rat, icv) or [Leu(31), Pro(34)]-NPY (0.2 and 0.4ng/rat, icv) pretreatment. Conversely, pretreatment of animals with NPY Y1 receptor antagonist, BIBP3226 (0.1ng/rat, i.c.v.) completely blocked the antidepressant like effect of agmatine (20-40μg/rat) and its synergistic effect with NPY (1μg/rat, icv) or [Leu(31), Pro(34)]-NPY (0.2ng/rat, icv). The results of the present study showed that, agmatine exerts antidepressant like effects via NPYergic system possibly mediated by the NPY Y1 receptor subtypes and suggest that interaction between agmatine and neuropeptide Y may be relevant to generate the therapeutic strategies for the treatment of depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kotagale NR ; Paliwal NP ; Aglawe MM ; Umekar MJ ; Taksande BG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.peptides.2013.04.018 ","Keywords":"Agmatine/*pharmacology\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nArginine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nInjections, Intraventricular\r\nMale\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nNeuropeptide Y/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nReceptors, Neuropeptide Y/*agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism\r\nSwimming\r\nAgmatine\r\nDepression\r\nFST\r\nImmobility time\r\nNPY Y1 receptors\r\nNeuropeptide Y","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kotagale NR, Paliwal NP, Aglawe MM, Umekar MJ, and Taksande BG (2013) Possible involvement of neuropeptide Y Y1 receptors in antidepressant like effect of agmatine in rats..

The magnitude of the effect was slightly smaller than that of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (15 mg/kg). Agmatine did not change the locomotion of mice in the open field.

With the rising cost of prescription medications and their production of unwanted side effects, patients are exploring herbal and other natural remedies for the management and treatment of psychological conditions. Psychological disorders are one of the most frequent conditions seen by clinicians, and often require a long-term regimen of prescription medications. Approximately 6.8 million Americans suffer from generalized anxiety disorder. Many also suffer from the spectrum of behavioural and physical side effects that often accompany its treatment. It is not surprising that there is universal interest in finding effective natural anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) treatments with a lower risk of adverse effects or withdrawal. METHODS: An electronic and manual search was performed through MEDLINE/PubMed and EBSCO. Articles were not discriminated by date of publication. Available clinical studies published in English that used human participants and examined the anxiolytic potential of dietary and herbal supplements were included. Data were extracted and compiled into tables that included the study design, sample population, intervention, control, length of treatment, outcomes, direction of evidence, and reported adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 24 studies that investigated five different CAM monotherapies and eight different combination treatments and involved 2619 participants met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. There were 21 randomized controlled trials and three open-label, uncontrolled observational studies. Most studies involved patients who had been diagnosed with either an anxiety disorder or depression (n = 1786). However, eight studies used healthy volunteers (n = 877) who had normal levels of anxiety, were undergoing surgery, tested at the upper limit of the normal range of a trait anxiety scale, had adverse premenstrual symptoms or were peri-menopausal, reported anxiety and insomnia, or had one month or more of elevated generalized anxiety. Heterogeneity and the small number of studies for each supplement or combination therapy prevented a formal meta-analysis. Of the randomized controlled trials reviewed, 71% (15 out of 21) showed a positive direction of evidence. Any reported side effects were mild to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available evidence, it appears that nutritional and herbal supplementation is an effective method for treating anxiety and anxiety-related conditions without the risk of serious side effects. There is the possibility that any positive effects seen could be due to a placebo effect, which may have a significant psychological impact on participants with mental disorders. However, based on this systematic review, strong evidence exists for the use of herbal supplements containing extracts of passionflower or kava and combinations of L-lysine and L-arginine as treatments for anxiety symptoms and disorders. Magnesium-containing supplements and other herbal combinations may hold promise, but more research is needed before these products can be recommended to patients. St. John's wort monotherapy has insufficient evidence for use as an effective anxiolytic treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lakhan SE ; Vieira KF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1475-2891-9-42 ","Keywords":"Anti-Anxiety Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety/*drug therapy\r\nAnxiety Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nArginine/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nHypericum\r\nKava\r\nLysine/therapeutic use\r\nMagnesium/therapeutic use\r\nPassiflora\r\n*Phytotherapy\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nVitamin B 6/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lakhan SE, and Vieira KF (2010) Nutritional and herbal supplements for anxiety and anxiety-related disorders: systematic review..

Given the evidence for serotonergic dysregulation in SAD, we examined the possible role of l-tryptophan as an augmentation strategy for nonresponders and partial responders to light therapy. METHOD: Eligible drug-free patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for SAD were treated for 2 weeks using a standard morning light therapy regimen (10,000 lux cool-white fluorescent light for 30 minutes). Partial and nonresponders were treated for 2 weeks with open-label l-tryptophan (1 g 3 times daily) while light therapy was continued. Ratings at baseline and follow-up included the 29-item Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, SAD version (SIGH-SAD) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. RESULTS: Sixteen patients began the l-tryptophan augmentation phase. Two patients discontinued medications within 3 days because of side effects. In the 14 patients completing treatment, the addition of l-tryptophan resulted in significant reduction of mean depression scores. Nine of 14 patients (64%) showed very good clinical responses to combined treatment and minimal side effects. CONCLUSION: This open-label study suggests that l-tryptophan may be an effective augmentation strategy for those patients with SAD who show limited or poor response to bright ligh therapy. Further placebo-controlled studies are warranted to demonstrate efficacy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lam RW ; Levitan RD ; Tam EM ; Yatham LN ; Lamoureux S ; Zis AP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/070674379704200309 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPersonality Inventory\r\n*Phototherapy\r\nSeasonal Affective Disorder/diagnosis/psychology/*therapy\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nTryptophan/*administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lam RW, Levitan RD, Tam EM, Yatham LN, Lamoureux S, and Zis AP (1997) L-tryptophan augmentation of light therapy in patients with seasonal affective disorder..

METHODS: Nutraceutical-focused systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines identified the more commonly studied augmentation strategies for depression.

We showed that daily treatment with the IDO1 inhibitor 1-methyl-D-tryptophan partially rescues UCMS-induced KP alterations as does the antidepressant fluoxetine. More importantly we demonstrated that 1-methyl-D-tryptophan was able to alleviate most of the behavioural changes resulting from UCMS exposure. We also showed that both fluoxetine and 1-methyl-D-tryptophan robustly reduced peripheral levels of proinflammatory cytokines in UCMS mice suggesting that their therapeutic effects might occur through anti-inflammatory processes. KP inhibition might be involved in the positive effects of fluoxetine on mice behaviour and could be a relevant strategy to counteract depressive-like symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Laugeray A ; Launay JM ; Callebert J ; Mutlu O ; Guillemin GJ ; Belzung C ; Barone PR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164337 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/pharmacology\r\nChronic Disease\r\nCytokines/metabolism\r\nDepression/physiopathology/prevention & control\r\nFluoxetine/*pharmacology\r\nIndoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism\r\nInflammation Mediators/metabolism\r\nKynurenine/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMice, Inbred BALB C\r\nSignal Transduction/drug effects\r\nStress, Psychological/physiopathology/*prevention & control\r\nTime Factors\r\nTryptophan/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Laugeray A, Launay JM, Callebert J, Mutlu O, Guillemin GJ, Belzung C, and Barone PR (2016) Chronic Treatment with the IDO1 Inhibitor 1-Methyl-D-Tryptophan Minimizes the Behavioural and Biochemical Abnormalities Induced by Unpredictable Chronic Mild Stress in Mice - Comparison with Fluoxetine..

METHOD: Medline searches and reviews of bibliographies were used to identify relevant articles. Each treatment was reviewed with particular attention paid to empirical support, as well as to potential mechanisms of action that might affect not only depression but also CHD endpoints. RESULTS: Nearly all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of depression treatments have been conducted with non-CHD patients. These studies have provided the most support for psychological treatments, particularly CBT and IPT. Aerobic exercise, SJW, and SAMe also have considerable empirical support in otherwise healthy persons, but SJW may have undesirable side effects for CHD patients. Data for EFAs, CP, and acupuncture are limited; however, the use of aerobic exercise shows considerable promise for cardiac patients. CONCLUSIONS: There are few RCTs of patients with clinical depression and CHD, and those that exist have significant methodological limitations. Nonetheless, there is preliminary evidence that nonpharmacologic treatments are effective for cardiac patients with depression. In terms of reducing depression, the most evidence exists for psychological treatments, particularly CBT and IPT. However, there is little evidence that such treatment would also improve CHD risk factors. Aerobic exercise offers more promise to improve both mental and physical health due to its effect on cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes and thus warrants particular attention in future trials.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lett HS ; Davidson J ; Blumenthal JA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/01.psy.0000163453.24417.97 ","Keywords":"Acupuncture Therapy\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nCoronary Disease/*etiology\r\nDepression/complications/*therapy\r\n*Exercise\r\nFatty Acids, Essential/economics/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nHypericum\r\nPhytotherapy\r\nPicolinic Acids/therapeutic use\r\n*Psychotherapy\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lett HS, Davidson J, and Blumenthal JA (2005) Nonpharmacologic treatments for depression in patients with coronary heart disease..

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. PATIENTS: Thirty individuals with major depressive disorder. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment over 8 weeks with 20 mg of fluoxetine per day and either tryptophan (2 to 4 g per day) or placebo. OUTCOME MEASURES: Mood was assessed using the 29-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-29) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Laboratory sleep studies were done at baseline and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment using standard procedures. RESULTS: During the first week of treatment, there was a significantly greater decrease in HDRS-29 depression scores, and a similar trend in BDI scores, in the tryptophan/fluoxetine group than in the placebo/fluoxetine group. No significant differences were noted at later time points. With respect to sleep measures, there was a significant group-by-time interaction for slow-wave sleep at week 4. Further analysis revealed a significant decrease in slow-wave sleep after 4 weeks of treatment in the placebo/fluoxetine group, but not in the tryptophan/fluoxetine group. No cases of serotonin syndrome occurred, and the combination was well tolerated, although the 4 g per day dosage of tryptophan produced daytime drowsiness. CONCLUSIONS: Combining 20 mg of fluoxetine with 2 g of tryptophan daily at the outset of treatment for major depressive disorder appears to be a safe protocol that may have both a rapid antidepressant effect and a protective effect on slow-wave sleep. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm these initial findings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Levitan RD ; Shen JH ; Jindal R ; Driver HS ; Kennedy SH ; Shapiro CM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nFluoxetine/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nHypnotics and Sedatives/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nTryptophan/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Levitan RD, Shen JH, Jindal R, Driver HS, Kennedy SH, and Shapiro CM (2000) Preliminary randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of tryptophan combined with fluoxetine to treat major depressive disorder: antidepressant and hypnotic effects..

S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a naturally occurring molecule which serves as a major methyl-donor in human cellular metabolism, is required for the synthesis and maintenance of several neurotransmitters that have been implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MDD. OBJECTIVES: This study is a secondary analysis of a clinical trial involving the use of adjunctive SAMe for MDD. METHODS: Forty-six serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SRI) non-responders with MDD enrolled in a 6-week, double-blind, randomized trial of adjunctive oral SAMe were administered the self-rated cognitive and physical symptoms questionnaire (CPFQ), a validated measure of cognitive as well as physical symptoms of MDD, before and after treatment. RESULTS: There was a greater improvement in the ability to recall information (P=0.04) and a trend towards statistical significance for greater improvement in word-finding (P=0.09) for patients who received adjunctive SAMe than placebo. None of the remaining five items reached statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest that SAMe can improve memory-related cognitive symptoms in depressed patients, and warrant replication.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Levkovitz Y ; Alpert JE ; Brintz CE ; Mischoulon D ; Papakostas GI ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.eurpsy.2011.03.006 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nCognition/*drug effects\r\nCognition Disorders/complications/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/complications/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMental Recall/drug effects\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNeuropsychological Tests\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nSelf Report\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Levkovitz Y, Alpert JE, Brintz CE, Mischoulon D, and Papakostas GI (2012) Effects of S-adenosylmethionine augmentation of serotonin-reuptake inhibitor antidepressants on cognitive symptoms of major depressive disorder..

However, whether GlyRs in the LHb contribute to alcohol-related behaviors is unknown. Here, we report that rats experiencing withdrawal from chronic alcohol consumption showed higher anxiety and sensitivity to stress compared to their alcohol-naïve counterparts. Intra-LHb injection of glycine attenuated these aberrant behaviors and reduced alcohol intake upon alcohol re-access. Glycine's effect was blocked by strychnine, a GlyR antagonist, indicating that it was mediated by strychnine-sensitive GlyRs. Conversely, intra-LHb strychnine elicited anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in Naïve rats but not in withdrawal rats. Additionally, both the frequency and the amplitude of the spontaneous IPSCs were lower in LHb neurons in slices of withdrawal rats compared to naïve rats. Also, there were sporadic strychnine-sensitive synaptic events in some LHb neurons. Bath perfusion of strychnine induced a depolarizing inward current and increased action potential firings in LHb neurons. By contrast, bath perfusion of glycine or sarcosine, a glycine transporter subtype 1 inhibitor, inhibited LHb activity. Collectively, these data reveal that LHb neurons are under the tonic glycine inhibition both in physiological and pathological conditions. Activation of GlyRs reverses LHb hyperactivity, alleviates aberrant behaviors, and reduces alcohol intake, thus highlighting the GlyRs in the LHb as a potential therapeutic target for alcohol-use disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Li W ; Zuo W ; Wu W ; Zuo QK ; Fu R ; Wu L ; Zhang H ; Ndukwe M ; Ye JH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuropharm.2019.107688 ","Keywords":"Action Potentials/physiology\r\nAlcohol Drinking/*prevention & control\r\nAnimals\r\nAnxiety/chemically induced/complications/*prevention & control\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects/physiology\r\nDepression/chemically induced/complications/*prevention & control\r\nGlycine/administration & dosage/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology\r\nHabenula/*physiology\r\nInhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials/physiology\r\nMale\r\nMicroinjections\r\nNeural Inhibition/physiology\r\nNeurons/*physiology\r\nRats\r\nReceptors, Glycine/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology\r\nSarcosine/pharmacology\r\nStrychnine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/complications/*prevention & control\r\nAlcohol exposure and withdrawal\r\nAversion\r\nElectrophysiology\r\nElevated plus maze test\r\nForced swimming test\r\nStrychnine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Li W, Zuo W, Wu W, Zuo QK, Fu R, Wu L, Zhang H, Ndukwe M, and Ye JH (2019) Activation of glycine receptors in the lateral habenula rescues anxiety- and depression-like behaviors associated with alcohol withdrawal and reduces alcohol intake in rats..

However, their pharmacological effects, especially antidepressant-like effects, have not been reported so far. In this study, one of the gardenia blue pigments, was obtained from the reaction of genipin with tyrosine (genipin-tyrosine derivant (GTD)), and its antidepressant-like effects were investigated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) models. The results showed that GTD could attenuate depressive-like behaviors in both animal models. GTD reversed the LPS-induced cytokine increase of TNF-α, IL-6, and corticosterone (CORT) in mice plasma and hippocampus. In CUMS rats, GTD treatment significantly reduced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-related stress hormone levels in plasma including those of CORT, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Besides, GTD increased plasma testosterone and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in CUMS rats. GTD increased serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE) in rat hippocampus and corpus striatum. Consistently, hippocampal metabolomic analysis demonstrated that GTD restored monoamine neurotransmitter metabolism, mitochondrial oxidative function, and membrane structural integrity. Our data suggested that GTD produced antidepressant-like activity through the restoration of the HPA axis hormone balance and the regulation of neurotransmitter release.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Li KD ; Yan K ; Wang QS ; Tian JS ; Xu D ; Zhang WY ; Cui YL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1039/c9fo00480g ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage/chemistry\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nCorticosterone/metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/psychology\r\nGardenia/*chemistry\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nInterleukin-6/genetics/metabolism\r\nIridoids/*chemistry\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nPigments, Biological/*administration & dosage/chemistry\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System/drug effects/metabolism\r\nPlant Extracts/*administration & dosage/chemistry\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nTyrosine/*chemistry","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Li KD, Yan K, Wang QS, Tian JS, Xu D, Zhang WY, and Cui YL (2019) Antidepressant-like effects of dietary gardenia blue pigment derived from genipin and tyrosine..

Tryptophan metabolites, such as serotonin and melatonin, are thought to participate in the regulation of mood and sleep and tryptophan is used to treat insomnia, sleep apnea, and depression. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the intake of tryptophan and its associations with biochemical, behavioral, sleep, and health and safety outcomes in adults in a secondary analysis of a large, publicly available database of the US population. METHODS: Data from the NHANES 2001-2012 (n = 29,687) were used to determine daily intakes of tryptophan and its associations with biochemical markers of health- and safety-related outcomes, self-reported depression, and sleep-related variables. Data were adjusted for demographic factors and protein intake. Linear trends were computed across deciles of intake for each outcome variable, and P-trends were determined. RESULTS: The usual tryptophan intake by US adults was 826 mg/d, severalfold higher than the Estimated Average Requirement for adults of 4 mg/(kg ⋅ d) (∼280 mg/d for a 70-kg adult). Most health- and safety-related biochemical markers of liver function, kidney function, and carbohydrate metabolism were not significantly (P-trend > 0.05) associated with deciles of tryptophan intake and were well within normal ranges, even for individuals in the 99th percentile of intake. Usual intake deciles of tryptophan were inversely associated with self-reported depression measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire raw score (0-27; P-trend < 0.01) and calculated level (1 = no depression, 5 = severe depression; P-trend < 0.01) and were positively associated with self-reported sleep duration (P-trend = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Tryptophan intake was not related to most markers of liver function, kidney function or carbohydrate metabolism.

However, it still inevitably induces psychotomimetic side effects. N,N-dimethylglycine (DMG) is a derivative of the amino acid glycine and is used as a dietary supplement. Recently, DMG has been found acting at glycine binding site of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). As blockade of NMDARs is one of the main mechanisms responsible for the action of ketamine on central nervous system, DMG might modulate the behavioral responses to ketamine. The present study determined the effects of DMG on the ketamine-induced psychotomimetic, anesthetic and antidepressant-like effects in mice. DMG pretreatment reversed the ketamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity and impairment in the rotarod performance, novel location and novel object recognition tests, and prepulse inhibition. In addition, DMG alone exhibited antidepressant-like effects in the forced swim test and produced additive effects when combined with ketamine. However, DMG did not affect ketamine-induced anesthesia. These results reveal that DMG could antagonize ketamine's psychotomimetic effects, yet produce additive antidepressant-like effects with ketamine, suggesting that DMG might have antipsychotic potential and be suitable as an add-on therapy to ketamine for patients with treatment-resistant depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lin JC ; Chan MH ; Lee MY ; Chen YC ; Chen HH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2016.06.002 ","Keywords":"Acoustic Stimulation\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nExcitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nExploratory Behavior/drug effects\r\nFear/drug effects/psychology\r\nHyperkinesis/chemically induced/drug therapy\r\nImmobility Response, Tonic/drug effects\r\nKetamine/*adverse effects/*pharmacology\r\nLocomotion/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMemory Disorders/chemically induced/drug therapy\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred ICR\r\nPrepulse Inhibition/drug effects\r\nSarcosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAnesthesia\r\nForced swimming\r\nGlycine\r\nNMDA receptor\r\nPrepulse inhibition","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lin JC, Chan MH, Lee MY, Chen YC, and Chen HH (2016) N,N-dimethylglycine differentially modulates psychotomimetic and antidepressant-like effects of ketamine in mice..

In this integrative narrative review, we aimed to appraise and further discuss the effects of (L)-theanine administration on anxiety disorders and psychological stress. Published data suggests that (L)-theanine administered at daily doses ranging from 200 to 400 mg for up to 8 weeks are safe and induce anxiolytic and anti-stress effects in acute and chronic conditions. (L)-theanine at doses lower and higher than these may also show promising therapeutic potential; however, a more thorough investigation through randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover clinical trials are necessary to elucidate its effects for longer periods, providing further insights for meta-analyses and the development of recommendation guidelines. Additionally, animal studies investigating a higher dosage, its combination with other pharmacological compounds and associated metabolic comorbidities are recommended, as cases of hepatotoxicity associated with the consumption of green tea extract have been reported.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lopes Sakamoto F; Metzker Pereira Ribeiro R; Amador Bueno A; Oliveira Santos H; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.phrs.2019.104395 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntihypertensive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety/drug therapy\r\nBlood Pressure/drug effects\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\nGlutamates/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use\r\nSchizophrenia/drug therapy\r\nSleep Aids, Pharmaceutical/*therapeutic use\r\nStress, Psychological/drug therapy\r\n(L)-theanine\r\nAnxiety\r\nCamellia sinensis\r\nGreen tea\r\nPsychological stress\r\nSchizophrenia","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lopes Sakamoto F, Metzker Pereira Ribeiro R, Amador Bueno A, and Oliveira Santos H (2019) Psychotropic effects of (L)-theanine and its clinical properties: From the management of anxiety and stress to a potential use in schizophrenia..

In this narrative review, studies examining the antidepressant effects of individual nutritional supplements in child and adolescent populations are appraised. Epidemiological studies examining the relationship between nutritional status and paediatric depression, or depressive symptoms are also reviewed. Nutrients covered in this article include: omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, s-adenosylmethionine, vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, iron and B-vitamins. Although several of these nutrients present as promising treatments for paediatric depression, there is a lack of high-quality studies examining the antidepressant effects of all the aforementioned ingredients.

The authors propose a strategy of adding creatine monohydrate (creatine) to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder. Such augmentation may lead to a more rapid onset of antidepressant effects and a greater treatment response, potentially by restoring brain bioenergetics at the cellular level. METHOD: Fifty-two women with major depressive disorder were enrolled in an 8-week double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial and randomly assigned to receive escitalopram in addition to either creatine (5 g/day, N=25) or placebo (N=27). Efficacy was primarily assessed by changes in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score. RESULTS: In comparison to the placebo augmentation group, patients receiving creatine augmentation showed significantly greater improvements in HAM-D score, as early as week 2 of treatment. This differential improvement favoring creatine was maintained at weeks 4 and 8. There were no differences between treatment groups in the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment prematurely (creatine: N=8, 32.0%; placebo: N=5, 18.5%) or in the overall frequency of all reported adverse events (creatine: 36 events; placebo: 45 events). CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that creatine augmentation of SSRI treatment may be a promising therapeutic approach that exhibits more rapid and efficacious responses in women with major depressive disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lyoo IK ; Yoon S ; Kim TS ; Hwang J ; Kim JE ; Won W ; Bae S ; Renshaw PF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.12010009 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nCitalopram/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nCreatine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination/methods/*psychology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\n*Women's Health","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lyoo IK, Yoon S, Kim TS, Hwang J, Kim JE, Won W, Bae S, and Renshaw PF (2012) A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of oral creatine monohydrate augmentation for enhanced response to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in women with major depressive disorder..

In bipolar disorder, there is evidence for glutathione depletion and increased oxidative stress, as well as dysregulation of glutamate; N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) has effects on both of these systems. Add-on NAC has been shown to have a significant benefit on depressive symptoms in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. In this report, we explore the effects of this compound in a subset of patients with bipolar II disorder from that trial. METHODS: Individuals were randomized to NAC or placebo in addition to treatment as usual, in a double-blind fashion. Mood and functional outcomes were assessed up to 24 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Fourteen individuals were available for this report, seven in each group. Six people achieved full remission of both depressive and manic symptoms in the NAC group; this was true for only two people in the placebo group (χ(2)=4.67, p=0.031). LIMITATIONS: Subgroup analyses in a small subsample of patients. Not all participants had elevated depression scores at baseline. CONCLUSION: Notwithstanding all the limitations that subgroup analysis of trials carry, this data could serve as a hypothesis-generating stimulus for further clinical trials of pharmacologic treatment for bipolar II depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Magalhães PV ; Dean OM ; Bush AI ; Copolov DL ; Malhi GS ; Kohlmann K ; Jeavons S ; Schapkaitz I ; Anderson-Hunt M ; Berk M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2010.08.001 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/*therapeutic use\r\nAdult\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Magalhães PV, Dean OM, Bush AI, Copolov DL, Malhi GS, Kohlmann K, Jeavons S, Schapkaitz I, Anderson-Hunt M, and Berk M (2011) N-acetyl cysteine add-on treatment for bipolar II disorder: a subgroup analysis of a randomized placebo-controlled trial..

Medical comorbidity is not only more prevalent in mood disorders, but is associated with increased costs, cognitive impairment and, ultimately, premature mortality. Oxidative stress and inflammation may mediate part of this association. To further investigate the association between medical comorbidity status and clinical improvement with adjuvant N acetyl cysteine (NAC) in the context of a placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial assessing the effect of NAC over 24 weeks. Symptomatic and functional outcomes were collected over the study period. Medical comorbidities were self-reported, and we took special interest in cardiovascular and endocrine conditions. We evaluated change from baseline to endpoint and the interaction between change and reported medical comorbidities. RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of patients reported have a cardiovascular or endocrine comorbidity. Although not found for depressive symptoms or quality of life, a significant interaction between medical comorbidity and change scores was consistently found for all functional outcomes. This indicated an advantage of NAC over placebo in those with a clinical comorbidity. CONCLUSION: Systemic illness moderated only the effect of NAC on functioning, not on depression. Demonstrating an improvement in functional outcomes with an agent that modulates redox and inflammatory pathways, this study lends empirical support to the idea that medical and psychiatric comorbidity are additive in contributing to allostatic states. One intriguing possibility is that comorbid clinical illness could be a marker for more severe oxidative stress states--and thus guide antioxidant use--in BD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Magalhães PV ; Dean OM ; Bush AI ; Copolov DL ; Weisinger D ; Malhi GS ; Kohlmann K ; Jeavons S ; Schapkaitz I ; Anderson-Hunt M ; Berk M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2011.11.011 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAdult\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*epidemiology/metabolism\r\nCardiovascular Diseases/drug therapy/epidemiology/metabolism\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nEndocrine System Diseases/drug therapy/epidemiology/metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nFree Radical Scavengers/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nInflammation/drug therapy/epidemiology/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOxidative Stress/drug effects/physiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Magalhães PV, Dean OM, Bush AI, Copolov DL, Weisinger D, Malhi GS, Kohlmann K, Jeavons S, Schapkaitz I, Anderson-Hunt M, and Berk M (2012) Systemic illness moderates the impact of N-acetyl cysteine in bipolar disorder..

Ketamine, a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, exerts rapid antidepressant effects in approximately 70% of patients. Glutamate evokes the release of D-serine from astrocytes and neurons, which then acts as a co-agonist and binds at the glycine site on the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors. Several studies have implicated glial deficits as one of the underlying facets of the neurobiology of depression. The present study tested the hypothesis that D-serine modulates behaviours related to depression. The behavioural effects of a single, acute D-serine administration were examined in several rodent tests of antidepressant-like effects, including the forced swim test (FST), the female urine sniffing test (FUST) following serotonin depletion, and the learned helplessness (LH) paradigm. D-serine significantly reduced immobility in the FST without affecting general motor function. Both D-serine and ketamine significantly rescued sexual reward-seeking deficits caused by serotonin depletion in the FUST. Finally, D-serine reversed LH behaviour, as measured by escape latency, number of escapes, and percentage of mice developing LH. Mice lacking NR1 expression in forebrain excitatory neurons exhibited a depression-like phenotype in the same behavioural tests, and did not respond to D-serine treatment. These findings suggest that D-serine produces antidepressant-like effects and support the notion of complex glutamatergic dysfunction in depression. It is unclear whether D-serine has a convergent influence on downstream synaptic plasticity cascades that may yield a similar therapeutic profile to NMDA antagonists like ketamine.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Malkesman O ; Austin DR ; Tragon T ; Wang G ; Rompala G ; Hamidi AB ; Cui Z ; Young WS ; Nakazawa K ; Zarate CA ; Manji HK ; Chen G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S1461145711001386 ","Keywords":"Analysis of Variance\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nCalcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2/genetics/metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/*physiopathology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nEscape Reaction/drug effects\r\nExcitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/pharmacology\r\nExploratory Behavior/drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nHelplessness, Learned\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nImmobility Response, Tonic/drug effects\r\nKetamine/pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nMice, Knockout\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects/genetics\r\nPhenylenediamines/pharmacology\r\nRNA, Messenger/metabolism\r\nRats\r\nRats, Inbred WKY\r\nReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/deficiency/genetics\r\nSerine/*administration & dosage\r\nSwimming","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Malkesman O, Austin DR, Tragon T, Wang G, Rompala G, Hamidi AB, Cui Z, Young WS, Nakazawa K, Zarate CA, Manji HK, and Chen G (2012) Acute D-serine treatment produces antidepressant-like effects in rodents..

Research has shown the involvement of dysfunctional brain serotonin (5-HT) biochemistry as a vulnerable biological factor in the onset of mood disturbances. Since the production of brain serotonin is limited by the availability of its plasma dietary amino acid precursor tryptophan, different foods and dietary amino acids that influence tryptophan availability are thought to alter affective behavior by changing brain 5-HT synthesis. Most dietary manipulation studies, however, reveal only modest affective changes, and note that these particularly occur in stress-prone or affected (sub-clinical) subjects. The current paper briefly summarizes evidence for the involvement of diminished brain serotonin function in affective disorders, discusses how this can be assessed and influenced by dietary manipulation procedures, and also notes how beneficial effects of dietary brain serotonin manipulation on affective behavior may be mediated by stress-induced brain serotonin vulnerability.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Markus CR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s12017-008-8039-9 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBrain Chemistry/*physiology\r\nDietary Carbohydrates/metabolism\r\nFood, Formulated/standards\r\nHumans\r\nLactalbumin/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nLimbic System/*metabolism/physiopathology\r\nMood Disorders/*diet therapy/*metabolism/physiopathology\r\nSerotonin/*deficiency\r\nStress, Psychological/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nTryptophan/*metabolism/*pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Markus CR (2008) Dietary amino acids and brain serotonin function; implications for stress-related affective changes..

Although serotonin production directly depends on the availability of its plasma dietary amino acid precursor tryptophan (TRP), previously described effects of tryptophan-rich food sources on stress-related behavior are rather modest. Recently, an egg protein hydrolysate (EPH) was developed that showed a much greater effect on brain TRP availability than pure TRP and other TRP-food sources and therefore may be more effective for performance under stress. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of EPH compared to placebo protein on plasma amino acids, stress coping and performance in subjects with high and low chronic stress vulnerabilities. METHODS: In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study, 17 participants with high and 18 participants with low chronic stress vulnerabilities were monitored for mood and performance under acute stress exposure either following intake of EPH or placebo. RESULTS: EPH significantly increased plasma TRP availability for uptake into the brain, decreased depressive mood in all subjects and improved perceptual-motor and vigilance performance only in low chronic stress-vulnerable subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The acute use of a TRP-rich egg protein hydrolysate (EPH) is an adequate method to increase plasma TRP for uptake into the brain and may be beneficial for perceptual-motor and vigilance performance in healthy volunteers.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Markus CR ; Verschoor E ; Firk C ; Kloek J ; Gerhardt CC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.clnu.2010.01.003 ","Keywords":"Affect\r\nAmino Acids/blood/metabolism\r\nBrain/*metabolism\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\nDepression/diet therapy\r\nDietary Proteins/*metabolism\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nEggs\r\nFemale\r\n*Food, Fortified\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nProtein Hydrolysates/*metabolism\r\nPsychomotor Performance\r\nSerotonin/blood/metabolism\r\n*Stress, Psychological\r\nTryptophan/*blood/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Markus CR, Verschoor E, Firk C, Kloek J, and Gerhardt CC (2010) Effect of tryptophan-rich egg protein hydrolysate on brain tryptophan availability, stress and performance..

An adequate intake of nutrients contributes to better overall health and mental health in particular. Major depression is a severe mental illness with a high prevalence for which effective treatments exist but not in all cases the patient&#8217;s remission is achieved. Therefore, it is increasingly aimed at optimizing the supply of nutrients necessary for adequate brain functioning as adjunctive therapy to antidepressant treatment in depressive disorders. In this article we review those nutrients that have been related to depression: Omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, s-adenosylmethionine, tryptophan, magnesium, zinc and probiotics.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Martínez-Cengotitabengoa M ; González-Pinto A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Depressive Disorder/*diet therapy\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFolic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nTryptophan/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Martínez-Cengotitabengoa M, and González-Pinto A (2017) Nutritional supplements in depressive disorders..

To further examine this relationship, we repeated the study in a new cohort of patients while they remained on dopaminergic medications, conducted follow-up interviews and examinations in our original cohort, and conducted an open trial of the serotonin precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan in a group of new patients with depression. We were again able to demonstrate a significant reduction in cerebrospinal 5-HIAA in depressed patients in comparison to controls and patients without depression. Demented patients with Parkinson's disease, particularly those with concurrent depression, had the lowest values of 5-HIAA. No new cases of depression occurred in our original cohort after 2 1/2 years of follow-up, and depression remitted following conventional or experimental treatment in four patients. Depression improved in six of the seven new patients following oral 5-hydroxytryptophan. Three of these patients allowed a repeat lumbar puncture, and the concentration of 5-HIAA increased following 5-hydroxytryptophan. These three studies support our hypothesis that depression in idiopathic Parkinson's disease is associated with a reduction in brain serotonin.

To date, there has been inconsistent research on the use of 5-HTP in PD. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 5-HTP with those of placebo on apathy and depressive symptoms in patients with PD. METHODS: A single-center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial was employed; 25 individuals were subsequently enrolled into the study. Patients received placebo and 50 mg of 5-HTP daily over a period of 4 weeks. For the assessment of efficacy on depressive and apathy symptoms the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Apathy Scale (AS) were respectively administered at screening, baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16. Primary efficacy outcomes were the comparison of 5-HTP to placebo in mean change from baseline to weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 in total score on the AS, BDI-II and HDRS. RESULTS: Repeated-measures analysis revealed a significant improvement of depressive symptoms during the 50-mg 5-HTP treatment compared with placebo as assessed by the HDRS. No effect of 5-HTP was seen on apathy symptoms assessed by the AS. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence of clinical benefit of 5-HTP for treating depressive symptoms in PD. Larger studies with a longer treatment duration are needed to corroborate these early findings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Meloni M ; Puligheddu M ; Carta M ; Cannas A ; Figorilli M ; Defazio G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/ene.14179 ","Keywords":"5-Hydroxytryptophan/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAged\r\n*Apathy\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\nDepression/*complications/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nParkinson Disease/*complications/*psychology\r\n5-hydroxytryptophan\r\nParkinson's disease\r\napathy\r\ndepression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Meloni M, Puligheddu M, Carta M, Cannas A, Figorilli M, and Defazio G (2020) Efficacy and safety of 5-hydroxytryptophan on depression and apathy in Parkinson's disease: a preliminary finding..

These results are consistent with the hypothesis that lithium carbonate may enhance serotonin (5-HT) receptor sensitivity, whereas TCA and second-generation antidepressants diminish 5-HT receptor sensitivity.

A diet enriched with alpha-lactalbumin increases the ratio of tryptophan to the other large neutral amino acids, which may in turn increase brain serotonin content. In stress-vulnerable individuals, alpha-lactalbumin improved mood and attenuated the cortisol response after experimental stress. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of an alpha-lactalbumin-enriched diet on mood and stress response in recovered depressed subjects and healthy controls. Forty-three subjects (twenty-three recovered depressed and twenty healthy subjects) received alpha-lactalbumin and casein (placebo) on separate days, in a double-blind randomised crossover design. On both occasions, subjects underwent a stress test (an unsolvable mental arithmetic task with loud noise). The stress test affected mood in both conditions. Although the alpha-lactalbumin diet led to the expected rises in tryptophan and tryptophan:large neutral amino acids ratio, only minimal effects were found on mood and cortisol response to experimental stress. The results were the same for recovered depressed patients and controls. A 1 d diet enriched with alpha-lactalbumin is not sufficient to prevent a stress-induced mood deterioration or a cortisol response in unmedicated, recovered depressed subjects. Future studies may investigate the effects of longer-term diets or may investigate different samples (e.g. medicated patients).","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Merens W ; Booij L ; Markus R ; Zitman FG ; Onkenhout W ; Van der Does AJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1079/bjn20051492 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*Affect\r\nAmino Acids/blood\r\nAnalysis of Variance\r\nCase-Control Studies\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\nDepression/*diet therapy/metabolism/psychology\r\n*Diet\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nHydrocortisone/analysis/*blood\r\nLactalbumin/*administration & dosage/blood\r\nMale\r\nSaliva/chemistry\r\nStatistics, Nonparametric\r\nTryptophan/blood","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Merens W, Booij L, Markus R, Zitman FG, Onkenhout W, and Van der Does AJ (2005) The effects of a diet enriched with alpha-lactalbumin on mood and cortisol response in unmedicated recovered depressed subjects and controls..

It has recently been shown that antidepressant treatment has immediate effects on emotional information processing, which is much faster than any clinically significant effects. This review aims to investigate whether the effects on emotional information processing are reliable, and whether these effects are related to eventual clinical outcome. Treatment-efficiency may be greatly improved if early changes in emotional information processing are found to predict clinical outcome following antidepressant treatment. METHODS: Review of studies investigating the short-term effects of serotonin manipulations (including medication) on the processing of emotional information, using PubMed and PsycInfo databases. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies were identified. Serotonin manipulations were found to affect attentional bias, facial emotion recognition, emotional memory, dysfunctional attitudes and decision making. The sequential link between changes in emotional processing and mood remains to be further investigated. LIMITATIONS: The number of studies on serotonin manipulations and emotional information processing in currently depressed subjects is small. No studies yet have directly tested the link between emotional information processing and clinical outcome during the course of antidepressant treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Serotonin function is related to several aspects of emotional information processing, but it is unknown whether these changes predict or have any relationship with clinical outcome.

In the late 1970s and 1980s, numerous studies were performed in which depressed patients were treated with the serotonin precursors L-tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), and the dopamine and norepinephrine precursors tyrosine and L-phenylalanine. This article briefly reviews the published research on the efficacy of neurotransmitter precursors in treating depression, highlights the findings of studies, and discusses issues regarding the interpretation of those findings. The nature of the studies makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the efficacy of neurotransmitter precursors for treating depression. While there is evidence that precursor loading may be of therapeutic value, particularly for the serotonin precursors 5-HTP and tryptophan, more studies of suitable design and size might lead to more conclusive results.

In an attempt to improve the efficacy of antidepressants, new drugs that also modify dopamine levels are being developed. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of l-DOPA administration on the effect elicited by antidepressants on serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission. To this end, single-unit extracellular recordings of the noradrenergic nucleus, locus coeruleus (LC), and the serotonergic nucleus, dorsal raphe (DRN) combined with behavioural approaches were performed. l-DOPA did not modify the basal neuronal activity in either the LC or the DRN or induce any change in the modified forced swimming test. However, l-DOPA enhanced the neuronal response to reboxetine in the LC and increased its antidepressant-like effects but counteracted the effect of fluoxetine on neurons in the LC and decreased its antidepressant-like effect. The sensitivity of neurons in the DRN to reboxetine and fluoxetine was not altered by the administration of l-DOPA. Taken together, these results indicate that l-DOPA modifies the effect of SSRI and NRI antidepressants in opposing ways.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Miguelez C ; Berrocoso E ; Mico JA ; Ugedo L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuropharm.2012.11.016 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nContraindications\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFluoxetine/*administration & dosage\r\nLevodopa/*administration & dosage\r\nLocus Coeruleus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMorpholines/*administration & dosage\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects/physiology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nReboxetine\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Miguelez C, Berrocoso E, Mico JA, and Ugedo L (2013) L-DOPA modifies the antidepressant-like effects of reboxetine and fluoxetine in rats..

Brain NE and dopamine levels can be rapidly reduced by blocking synthesis with the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT). In the current investigation, AMPT was administered to drug-free depressed patients to evaluate the effect on mood of diminished catecholamine levels. Seventeen drug-free patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive episode were tested with AMPT and an active placebo control, diphenhydramine. Testing was accomplished in a double-blind, crossover fashion, with random assignment to test conditions. Each test included baseline evaluation, 2 days with administration of either AMPT or diphenhydramine, and a follow-up day. Diphenhydramine was used as an active control because of the significant sedation associated with AMPT. Behavioral ratings, including visual analogue scales for a variety of feeling states, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and plasma for 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenelethyleneglycol (MPHG) and homovanillic acid (HVA) levels, were obtained. AMPT significantly reduced plasma HVA by 70% and MHPG by 50%, but it had no significant effects on the HDRS. AMPT also significantly increased visual analogue ratings of \"tired\" and decreased ratings of \"energetic.\" Diphenhydramine significantly decreased HDRS scores, but the change was small and was not clinically apparent. The lack of AMPT effects on depressed mood, in conjunction with a prior report that large reductions in plasma tryptophan do not systematically alter depressed mood, indicate that monoamine deficiency by itself is insufficient explanation of the cause of depression. The role of the noradrenergic system needs to be considered in relationship to the many other neurobiologic factors that could be involved in the pathophysiology of depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Miller HL ; Delgado PL ; Salomon RM ; Heninger GR ; Charney DS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/0893-133X(95)00072-L ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nDiphenhydramine/therapeutic use\r\nEnzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethyltyrosines/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nTime Factors\r\nalpha-Methyltyrosine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Miller HL, Delgado PL, Salomon RM, Heninger GR, and Charney DS (1996) Effects of alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT) in drug-free depressed patients..

In recent years there has been a surge in the popularity of natural or alternative medications. Despite this growing popularity, there is limited evidence for the effectiveness of many of these natural treatments. S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) is one of the better studied of the natural remedies. SAMe is a methyl donor and is involved in the synthesis of various neurotransmitters in the brain. Derived from the amino acid L-methionine through a metabolic pathway called the one-carbon cycle, SAMe has been postulated to have antidepressant properties. A small number of clinical trials with parenteral or oral SAMe have shown that, at doses of 200-1600 mg/d, SAMe is superior to placebo and is as effective as tricyclic antidepressants in alleviating depression, although some individuals may require higher doses. SAMe may have a faster onset of action than do conventional antidepressants and may potentiate the effect of tricyclic antidepressants. SAMe may also protect against the deleterious effects of Alzheimer disease. SAMe is well tolerated and relatively free of adverse effects, although some cases of mania have been reported in bipolar patients. Overall, SAMe appears to be safe and effective in the treatment of depression, but more research is needed to determine optimal doses. Head-to-head comparisons with newer antidepressants should help to clarify SAMe's place in the psychopharmacologic armamentarium.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mischoulon D ; Fava M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/ajcn/76/5.1158S ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mischoulon D, and Fava M (2002) Role of S-adenosyl-L-methionine in the treatment of depression: a review of the evidence..

METHOD: Subjects were randomized from June 4, 2004, until August 8, 2008, to adjunctive placebo or SAMe 800-1600 mg/d for 6 weeks. Primary outcome measures included changes in one-carbon cycle intermediates within each treatment arm (by paired t test) and between treatment arms (by independent samples t test). Univariate analysis of variance and Fisher Protected Least Significant Difference were carried out to compare posttreatment levels of each one-carbon cycle intermediate. Secondary outcome measures included associations between clinical improvement and change in plasma intermediate levels, examined by linear regression (for change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores) and logistic regression (for response or remission). RESULTS: We found significant differences in pretreatment plasma levels of tHCY (P = .03) between the SAMe and placebo arms. Following 6 weeks of treatment, plasma SAMe (P = .002) and SAH (P < .0001) levels increased significantly in the SAMe arm; no intermediates in the placebo group changed significantly. Posttreatment plasma SAMe (P = .0035), SAH (P < .0001), and tHCY (P = .0016) levels differed significantly between the SAMe and placebo groups. No significant associations were found between plasma intermediate levels and clinical improvement, response, or remission. CONCLUSIONS: Despite concerns about the impact that SAMe therapy may have on homocysteine levels and risk of adverse cardiovascular effects, the lack of significant increase in tHCY levels after treatment suggests that no toxic effects from SAMe should be expected. Our findings, however, have some significant limitations and should be interpreted with caution.

In a randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel trial, fifty-nine mentally and physically healthy women aged 45-65 years received placebo (n 30) or the supplement (n 29) (both as 0.5 g twice per d) for 19 d. Emotional processing was significantly changed by supplementation, exhibiting a shift in bias away from negative stimuli. The results for the Affective Go/No-Go Task exhibited a slowing of responses to negative words, suggesting reduced attention to negative emotional stimuli. The results for the Facial Emotional Expression Rating Task also supported a shift away from attention to negative emotions and a bias towards happiness. An increase in arousal-like symptoms, labelled 'high energy', shorter reaction times and a slight benefit to sustained attention were observed in the treated subjects. Finally, when the supplement was taken 60-90 min before bedtime, a feeling of happiness before going to bed was consistently reported. In summary, daily consumption of a low-dose supplement containing bioavailable Trp may have beneficial effects on emotional and cognitive functions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mohajeri MH ; Wittwer J ; Vargas K ; Hogan E ; Holmes A ; Rogers PJ ; Goralczyk R ; Gibson EL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S0007114514003754 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/blood/metabolism/therapeutic use\r\nBeverages\r\nCognitive Dysfunction/blood/metabolism/*prevention & control\r\nCohort Studies\r\nDepression/blood/metabolism/prevention & control\r\n*Dietary Supplements/adverse effects\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nEgg Proteins, Dietary/adverse effects/metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nEnergy Metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMental Fatigue/blood/metabolism/*prevention & control\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNootropic Agents/adverse effects/blood/metabolism/therapeutic use\r\nProtein Hydrolysates/adverse effects/metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nReaction Time\r\nSerotonin Agents/adverse effects/blood/metabolism/therapeutic use\r\nSleep Wake Disorders/blood/metabolism/prevention & control\r\nStress, Psychological/blood/metabolism/*prevention & control\r\nTryptophan/adverse effects/blood/metabolism/*therapeutic use\r\nCognition\r\nDepression\r\nEmotion\r\nLumiVida™\r\nSerotonin\r\nTryptophan\r\nWell-being","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mohajeri MH, Wittwer J, Vargas K, Hogan E, Holmes A, Rogers PJ, Goralczyk R, and Gibson EL (2015) Chronic treatment with a tryptophan-rich protein hydrolysate improves emotional processing, mental energy levels and reaction time in middle-aged women..

Thirty-two patients were subsequently treated with L-tryptophan. In the patients who showed a particularly low plasma ratio of tryptophan to competing amino acids a remission frequency of 80% was observed on day 14. The efficacy of L-tryptophan in the patients who showed a plasma ratio within the upper normal range was extremely poor. The results suggest that the ratio in the plasma of tryptophan to competing amino acids is a useful predictor of the course of treatment of depressed subjects with L-tryptophan.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Møller SE ; Kirk L ; Honoré P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/0165-0327(80)90021-x ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAmino Acids/*blood\r\nBipolar Disorder/blood/*drug therapy\r\nDepressive Disorder/blood/*drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nTryptophan/*blood/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Møller SE, Kirk L, and Honoré P (1980) Relationship between plasma ratio of tryptophan to competing amino acids and the response to L-tryptophan treatment in endogenously depressed patients..

We have recently found that polyI:C treatment in neonatal mice induced abnormalities of emotional, cognitive, and sensorimotor gating and dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission in adulthood. In this study, we investigated the effect of the NMDA-receptor co-agonist D-serine on polyI:C-induced behavioral abnormalities in mice. Neonatal ICR mice were repeatedly injected with polyI:C for 5 days from postnatal day 2 to 6. At 10 weeks, sensorimotor gating function was analyzed in the prepulse inhibition (PPI) test. Emotional function was analyzed in open field and social interaction tests. Cognitive function was analyzed by novel object recognition tests. D-Serine dose-dependently improved polyI:C-induced impairment of emotional and cognitive behaviors whereas it had no effect on PPI deficit in adults. The ameliorating effects of D-serine were antagonized by pretreatment with an NMDA-receptor antagonist, MK-801. Although the mRNA level of D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) was increased in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of neonatal polyI:C-treated mice in adulthood, no changes were observed in D-serine content and DAAO enzymatic activity. These results suggest that D-serine ameliorates emotional and cognitive impairments of the polyI:C-treated mice through potentiating NMDA receptor activity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nagai T ; Yu J ; Kitahara Y ; Nabeshima T ; Yamada K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1254/jphs.12142fp ","Keywords":"Affective Symptoms/etiology/*prevention & control\r\nAnimals\r\nAnimals, Newborn\r\nAnti-Anxiety Agents/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nCentral Nervous System Viral Diseases/immunology/*physiopathology\r\nCerebral Cortex/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism\r\nCognition Disorders/etiology/*prevention & control\r\nD-Amino-Acid Oxidase/genetics/metabolism\r\n*Disease Models, Animal\r\nExploratory Behavior/drug effects\r\nGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred ICR\r\nNerve Tissue Proteins/agonists/genetics/metabolism\r\nNeurons/drug effects/immunology/metabolism\r\nNootropic Agents/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/therapeutic use\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/*agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism\r\nSerine/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/therapeutic use\r\nSpecific Pathogen-Free Organisms","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nagai T, Yu J, Kitahara Y, Nabeshima T, and Yamada K (2012) D-Serine ameliorates neonatal PolyI:C treatment-induced emotional and cognitive impairments in adult mice..

Therefore, we hypothesised that the consumption of animal products, especially eggs, may have positive effects on mental health, especially on major depression, because a previous study reported that egg consumption produces numerous beneficial effects in humans. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of chronic whole-egg treatment on depression-like behaviours in Wistar rats, a control strain, and Wistar Kyoto rats, an animal model of depression. METHODS: In both the rats, either whole-egg solution (5 ml/kg) or distilled water (5 ml/kg) was orally administrated for 35 days. During these periods, the open-field test (OFT) was conducted on the 21st day, and a forced swimming test (FST) was enforced on the 27th and 28th days. On the 36th day, the plasma and brain were collected. RESULTS: Chronic whole-egg treatment did not affect line crossing in the OFT, whereas it reduced the total duration of immobility in the FST on both strains. Furthermore, interestingly, the results indicated the possibility that whole-egg treatment elevated the incorporation of tryptophan into the brain, and the tryptophan concentration in the prefrontal cortex was actually increased by the treatment.

Both single and chronic L-serine treatments decreased the duration of immobility, which is an index of a depressive-like state, in the forced swimming test in both strains. However, the decreases in the duration of immobility appear to be regulated differently by the different mechanisms involved in single and chronic L-serine treatments. In the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, single L-serine treatment increased the concentrations of L-serine, but not D-serine, while chronic L-serine treatment increased those of D-serine, but not L-serine. These data suggest that the antidepressant-like effects of single and chronic L-serine treatments may have been induced by the increased L-serine and D-serine concentrations, respectively, in the brain. In addition, chronic L-serine treatment increased cystathionine concentrations in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in Wistar rats, but not in Wistar Kyoto rats, suggesting that Wistar Kyoto rats have an abnormality in the serine-cystathionine metabolic pathway. In conclusion, single and chronic L-serine treatments may induce antidepressant-like effects via the different mechanisms related to serine metabolism in the brain.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nagasawa M ; Otsuka T ; Togo Y ; Yamanaga M ; Yoshida J ; Uotsu N ; Teramoto S ; Yasuo S ; Furuse M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00726-017-2448-8 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nCystathionine/metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nHippocampus/*drug effects/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nMale\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/*drug effects/metabolism/physiopathology\r\nRats\r\nRats, Inbred WKY\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSerine/metabolism/*pharmacology\r\nStereoisomerism\r\nSwimming\r\nAntidepressant-like effect\r\nForced swimming test\r\nL-Serine\r\nWistar Kyoto rats","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nagasawa M, Otsuka T, Togo Y, Yamanaga M, Yoshida J, Uotsu N, Teramoto S, Yasuo S, and Furuse M (2017) Single and chronic L-serine treatments exert antidepressant-like effects in rats possibly by different means..

QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: PubMed was searched from January 1966 to February 2010 using the term depressive disorder in combination with St John's wort, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e), exercise, acupuncture, omega-3 fatty acids, and folate. Only relevant human trials were selected. MAIN MESSAGE: In a large meta-analysis, St John's wort was found to be equivalent to antidepressant drugs with fewer side effects. Exercise reduced depressive scores in 3 meta-analyses. Omega-3 fatty acids reduced depressive scores in a meta-analysis of 16 trials, but publication bias was identified. Oral SAM-e monotherapy reduced depressive scores in 4 of 5 small randomized controlled trials. Folate deficiency is associated with more severe and refractory depression, and supplementation reduced depressive scores in 2 of 3 randomized controlled trials. Acupuncture demonstrated limited efficacy in 1 meta-analysis and 5 other trials. CONCLUSION: St John's wort and regular exercise appear effective in the treatment of depression. Acupuncture appears ineffective for depression, but it might offer other health benefits. Other promising therapies include SAM-e, omega-3 fatty acid, and folic acid supplementation in selected patients; further study is warranted.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nahas R ; Sheikh O ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Acupuncture Therapy\r\n*Complementary Therapies\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nExercise Therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFolic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nHypericum\r\nPhytotherapy\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nahas R, and Sheikh O (2011) Complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of major depressive disorder..

Previous creatine augmentation studies in patients with major depression showed a beneficial effect. Eighteen patients (14 women) with major depression not responding to previous 3 weeks of antidepressant treatment were enrolled into a pilot, dose finding, 4-week double-blind parallel augmentation study where creatine monohydrate 5 or 10 g daily or placebo was added to ongoing SSRIs/SNRIs/NASA treatment. Rating scales included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impression Severity scale. Overall, there was no difference between creatine administered at 5 or 10 g daily and its corresponding placebos. Two female patients on creatine augmentation, but none on the placebo, showed early improvement of more than 50% reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale after 2 weeks of creatine treatment. No clinically relevant side effects were reported. This preliminary study seems to suggest that the strategy using creatine augmentation in major depressive women showing no 'real-life response' to 3 weeks of treatment with SSRIs/SNRIs/NASA treatment is of no advantage compared with placebo. However, such creatine augmentation may still induce a more rapid response in a small subgroup of these female patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nemets B ; Levine J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/YIC.0b013e32835ff20f ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nCreatine/*administration & dosage/chemistry\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/epidemiology/psychology\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPilot Projects\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/*administration & dosage\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nemets B, and Levine J (2013) A pilot dose-finding clinical trial of creatine monohydrate augmentation to SSRIs/SNRIs/NASA antidepressant treatment in major depression..

However, more recent data, including two larger trials, found that NAC was no more effective than placebo. We conducted a meta-analysis to appraise the possible efficacy of NAC in treating bipolar depression. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of NAC as a treatment augmentation strategy for bipolar depression was carried out in PubMed (1966-2020). We utilized random-effect analysis to evaluate improvement in depressive symptoms from baseline to endpoint as the primary efficacy measure. RESULTS: Six trials including 248 patients were included. Treatment augmentation with NAC showed a moderate effect size favoring NAC over placebo (d = 0.45, 95% C.I.: 0.06-0.84). There was substantial heterogeneity (I(2) = 49%). Meta-regression analyses did not identify any moderator that might explain variation in heterogeneity, including baseline depressive symptom scores, mean NAC dose, or duration of study. CONCLUSIONS: Results from six clinical trials suggest that treatment augmentation with NAC for bipolar depression appears to be superior to placebo, with a moderate effect size, but a large confidence interval. Larger clinical trials, investigating possible moderating factors, such as NAC dose, treatment duration, baseline depression severity, or chronicity of illness, are warranted.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nery FG ; Li W ; DelBello MP ; Welge JA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/bdi.13039 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/therapeutic use\r\n*Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis/drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nN-acetylcysteine\r\nbipolar disorder\r\ndepression\r\nmeta-analysis\r\nrandomized clinical trials\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nery FG, Li W, DelBello MP, and Welge JA (2021) N-acetylcysteine as an adjunctive treatment for bipolar depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials..

Mice were kindled by administering sub-convulsive doses of PTZ (35 mg/kg i.p.) at interval of 48 h. The naïve group (n = 7) constituted group 1, while successfully kindled mice were randomly assigned to five groups (n = 7). Group II served as vehicle treated group; groups III-V were treated with creatine 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg/day, p.o; Group V was given 25 mg/kg/day of phenytoin p.o. The treatment was for 15 consecutive days. The intensity of convulsion was scored according to a seven-point scale ranging from stage 0-7. Tail suspension test (TST) and Elevated plus maze (EPM) were utilized to assess depression and anxiety-like behavior respectively. After behavioral evaluation on day 15th, their brain was isolated and assayed for catalase, superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, and malondialdehyde. There was a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the seizure scores, anxiety and depression-like behaviors in mice from the 5th day of treatment. The antioxidant assays revealed significant (p < 0.05) increase in catalase and reduced glutathione, and significant (p < 0.05) reduction in lipid peroxidation in treated mice.

There is substantial evidence to suggest that D-serine is the most relevant co-agonist in forebrain regions and that alterations in D-serine levels contribute to psychiatric disorders. D-serine is produced through isomerization of L-serine by serine racemase (Srr), either in neurons or in astrocytes. It is released by astrocytes by an activity-dependent mechanism involving secretory vesicles. In the present study we generated transgenic mice (SrrTg) expressing serine racemase under a human GFAP promoter. These mice were biochemically and behaviorally analyzed using paradigms of anxiety, depression and cognition. Furthermore, we investigated the behavioral effects of long-term administration of D-serine added to the drinking water. Elevated brain D-serine levels in SrrTg mice resulted in specific behavioral phenotypes in the forced swim, novelty suppression of feeding and olfactory bulbectomy paradigms that are indicative of a reduced proneness towards depression-related behavior. Chronic dietary D-serine supplement mimics the depression-related behavioral phenotype observed in SrrTg mice. Our results suggest that D-serine supplementation may improve mood disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Otte DM ; Barcena de Arellano ML; Bilkei-Gorzo A ; Albayram O ; Imbeault S ; Jeung H ; Alferink J ; Zimmer A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0067131 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnxiety Disorders/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nGlial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/genetics\r\nHumans\r\nMice\r\nMice, Transgenic\r\nPromoter Regions, Genetic\r\nRacemases and Epimerases/genetics/metabolism\r\n*Serine/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Otte DM, Barcena de Arellano ML, Bilkei-Gorzo A, Albayram O, Imbeault S, Jeung H, Alferink J, and Zimmer A (2013) Effects of Chronic D-Serine Elevation on Animal Models of Depression and Anxiety-Related Behavior..

Several clinical trials have shown that SAMe possesses an antidepressant activity. This multicentre study was carried out to confirm both efficacy and safety of SAMe in the treatment of major depression. SAMe was given intramuscularly (i.m.) at a dose of 400 mg/d, double-blind, vs. 150 mg/d oral Imipramine (IMI) in patients with a diagnosis of major depressive episode, with a baseline score on the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) of >or=18. A total of 146 patients received SAMe whereas 147 received IMI for a period of 4 wk. The two main efficacy measures were endpoint HAMD score and percentage of responders to Clinical Global Impression (CGI) at week 4. Secondary efficacy measures were the final Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores and the response rate intended as a fall in HAMD scores of at least 50% with respect to baseline. The analysis of safety and tolerability was conducted in all treated patients. SAMe and IMI did not differ significantly on any efficacy measure, either main or secondary. Adverse events were significantly less in patients treated with SAMe compared to those treated with IMI. These data show 400 mg/d i.m. SAMe to be comparable to 150 mg/d oral IMI in terms of antidepressive efficacy, but significantly better tolerated. These findings suggest interesting perspectives for the use of SAMe in depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pancheri P ; Scapicchio P ; Chiaie RD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S1461145702003085 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAntidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/administration & dosage/adverse \r\n      effects/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nImipramine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & \r\n      derivatives/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pancheri P, Scapicchio P, and Chiaie RD (2002) A double-blind, randomized parallel-group, efficacy and safety study of intramuscular S-adenosyl-L-methionine 1,4-butanedisulphonate (SAMe) versus imipramine in patients with major depressive disorder..

The current practice is to increase the dose, switch to another antidepressant, or to combine the initial antidepressant with an antidepressant of a different class or a non-antidepressant agent. A growing number of studies have also been directed toward exploring the potential use of augmenting traditional antidepressants with nonpharmaceutic supplements, or even using such supplements as monotherapy for depression. S-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe) is one such compound. Compared with many other nonpharmaceutic supplements, SAMe has been extensively studied, and impressive literature extending back three decades suggests the antidepressant efficacy of SAMe. In the present work, the authors summarize the literature, focusing on the potential role of SAMe and its precursors in the pathophysiology of MDD, followed by a review of studies examining the use of SAMe for the treatment of MDD. Finally, the authors propose a model that would explain the actions of SAMe in the central nervous system.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Papakostas GI ; Alpert JE ; Fava M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11920-003-0085-2 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBrain/drug effects\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Papakostas GI, Alpert JE, and Fava M (2003) S-adenosyl-methionine in depression: a comprehensive review of the literature..

In addition, patients may experience adverse side effects from pharmacotherapy that not only hinder treatment compliance and adherence but, in some cases, may also contribute to increased disability, patient suffering, morbidity, and mortality. In order to enhance treatment efficacy and tolerability, patients and clinicians have become increasingly interested in nonpharmaceutical supplements for treating depression. One of the best-studied of these supplements is S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM-e), a naturally occurring molecule present in all living cells and a major methyl group donor in the human body. Controlled trials have found SAM-e to be more efficacious than placebo and equal in efficacy to the tricyclic antidepressants for treating major depressive disorder (MDD) when administered parenterally (either intravenously or intramuscularly). Less evidence supports the use of oral SAM-e, although some trials have demonstrated its efficacy as well. In addition, there is a paucity of evidence examining whether oral forms of SAM-e can be safe, well tolerated, and efficacious when used as adjunctive treatment for antidepressant nonresponders with MDD. Although preliminary data suggest SAM-e may be useful as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants, controlled studies are needed to confirm or refute these preliminary findings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Papakostas GI ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.8157su1c.04 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nHumans\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/*therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Papakostas GI (2009) Evidence for S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM-e) for the treatment of major depressive disorder..

Clearly, there is an urgent need to develop better tolerated and more effective treatments for this disorder. The use of S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe), a naturally occurring molecule that serves as a methyl donor in human cellular metabolism, as adjunctive treatment for antidepressant nonresponders with major depressive disorder represents one such effort toward novel pharmacotherapy development. METHOD: Participants were 73 serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) nonresponders with major depressive disorder enrolled in a 6-week, double-blind, randomized trial of adjunctive oral SAMe (target dose: 800 mg/twice daily). Patients continued to receive their SRI treatment at a stable dose throughout the 6-week trial. The primary outcome measure for the study was the response rates according to the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). RESULTS: The HAM-D response and remission rates were higher for patients treated with adjunctive SAMe (36.1% and 25.8%, respectively) than adjunctive placebo (17.6% versus 11.7%, respectively). The number needed to treat for response and remission was approximately one in six and one in seven, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of SAMe- versus placebo-treated patients who discontinued the trial for any reason (20.6% versus 29.5%, respectively), due to adverse events (5.1% versus 8.8%, respectively), or due to inefficacy (5.1% versus 11.7%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that SAMe can be an effective, well-tolerated, and safe adjunctive treatment strategy for SRI nonresponders with major depressive disorder and warrant replication.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Papakostas GI ; Mischoulon D ; Shyu I ; Alpert JE ; Fava M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ajp.2009.09081198 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPatient Dropouts\r\nPlacebos\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales/statistics & numerical data\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Papakostas GI, Mischoulon D, Shyu I, Alpert JE, and Fava M (2010) S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) augmentation of serotonin reuptake inhibitors for antidepressant nonresponders with major depressive disorder: a double-blind, randomized clinical trial..

In this article, we review the literature on folates and S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), 2 natural compounds linked in the 1-carbon cycle metabolic pathway, for which substantial evidence supports their involvement in mood disorders. Background information, efﬁcacy data, proposed mechanisms of action, and side effects are reviewed. Based on existing data, supplementation with SAMe, as well as with various formulations of folates, appears to be efficacious and well tolerated in reducing depressive symptoms. Compared with other forms of folates, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-methylfolate or 5-MTHF) may represent a preferable treatment option for MDD given its greater bioavailability in patients with a genetic polymorphism, and the lower risk of specific side effects associated with folic acid. Although further randomized controlled trials in this area appear warranted, SAMe and L-methylfolate may represent a useful addition to the AD armamentarium.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Papakostas GI ; Cassiello CF ; Iovieno N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/070674371205700703 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology\r\nDepressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine\r\nHumans\r\nOne-Carbon Group Transferases/physiology\r\nPteroylpolyglutamic Acids/adverse effects/physiology/*therapeutic use\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/adverse effects/physiology/*therapeutic use\r\nTetrahydrofolates/adverse effects/physiology/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Papakostas GI, Cassiello CF, and Iovieno N (2012) Folates and S-adenosylmethionine for major depressive disorder..

The decreased binding switches the metabolism in PBMLs towards serotonin synthesis, resulting in the reduced production of melatonin. The ingestion of L-tryptophan during the day is hypothesized to increase the levels of melatonin, released from the gastrointestinal tract, in patients with winter seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Due to the relative shortage of light, coincident with a predisposed metabolic error, there would be no switch towards serotonin synthesis among winter SAD patients in winter. The rate of serotonin synthesis could thus remain inadequately low to maintain optimal mood in winter SAD patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Partonen T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/s0306-9877(98)90042-1 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nCells, Cultured\r\nDigestive System/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nLeukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism\r\nLight\r\nMelatonin/*biosynthesis/therapeutic use\r\nPineal Gland/*metabolism\r\nSeasonal Affective Disorder/drug therapy/*metabolism\r\nSerotonin/*biosynthesis/therapeutic use\r\nTryptophan/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Partonen T (1998) Extrapineal melatonin and exogenous serotonin in seasonal affective disorder..

In an attempt to investigate a safer compound that may afford an antidepressant effect similar to ketamine, this study examined the effects of the ergogenic compound creatine in a model of depression, and the involvement of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) pathway in its effect. In order to induce a depressive-like behavior, mice were administered with corticosterone (20 mg/kg, per os (p.o.)) for 21 days. This treatment increased immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST), an effect abolished by a single administration of creatine (10 mg/kg, p.o.) or ketamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.), but not by fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, p.o., conventional antidepressant). Treatment of mice with wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor, 0.1 μg/site, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)) or rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor, 0.2 nmol/site, i.c.v.) abolished the anti-immobility effect of creatine and ketamine. None of the treatments affected locomotor activity of mice. The immunocontents of p-mTOR, p-p70S6 kinase (p70S6K), and postsynaptic density-95 protein (PSD95) were increased by creatine and ketamine in corticosterone or vehicle-treated mice. Moreover, corticosterone-treated mice presented a decreased hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level, an effect abolished by creatine or ketamine. Altogether, the results indicate that creatine shares with ketamine the ability to acutely reverse the corticosterone-induced depressive-like behavior by a mechanism dependent on PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and modulation of the synaptic protein PSD95 as well as BDNF in the hippocampus, indicating the relevance of targeting these proteins for the management of depressive disorders. Moreover, we suggest that creatine should be further investigated as a possible fast-acting antidepressant.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pazini FL ; Cunha MP ; Rosa JM ; Colla AR ; Lieberknecht V ; Oliveira Á ; Rodrigues AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s12035-015-9580-9 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\n*Behavior, Animal\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nCorticosterone/blood\r\nCreatine/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/blood/*drug therapy/pathology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFemale\r\nFluoxetine\r\nKetamine/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nMice\r\nModels, Biological\r\nPhosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism\r\nProto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism\r\nSignal Transduction/*drug effects\r\nTOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism\r\nAkt\r\nCorticosterone\r\nCreatine\r\nKetamine\r\nTail suspension test\r\nmTOR","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pazini FL, Cunha MP, Rosa JM, Colla AR, Lieberknecht V, Oliveira Á, and Rodrigues AL (2016) Creatine, Similar to Ketamine, Counteracts Depressive-Like Behavior Induced by Corticosterone via PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway..

In the present study, we investigated the ability of creatine to counteract the morphological and behavioral effects elicited by chronic administration of corticosterone (CORT, 20 mg/kg, p.o.) for 21 days to mice, a pharmacological model of depression that mimics exposure to stress. CORT treatment increased immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swim test (FST), as well as latency to immobility in the FST, and decreased the sucrose consumption in the sucrose preference test (SPT). These behavioral effects were associated with decreased hippocampal cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation and increased glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) immunostaining (suggestive of astrogliosis) in dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. These CORT-induced alterations were abolished by treatment with either fluoxetine (a conventional antidepressant) or creatine for 21 days (both 10 mg/kg, p.o.). In addition, fluoxetine, but not creatine, was able to reverse the CORT-induced reduction in serum CORT levels. Collectively, our results suggest that creatine produces morphological alterations that contribute to the improvement of depressive-like behaviors triggered by chronic CORT administration in mice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pazini FL ; Cunha MP ; Azevedo D ; Rosa JM ; Colla A ; de Oliveira J ; Ramos-Hryb AB ; Brocardo PS ; Gil-Mohapel J ; Rodrigues ALS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s12035-016-0148-0 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nCell Differentiation/*drug effects\r\nCell Proliferation/*drug effects\r\nCorticosterone/*pharmacology\r\nCreatine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nFeeding Behavior/drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nFluoxetine/pharmacology\r\nGlial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism\r\nHippocampus/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nMice\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nNeurons/cytology/drug effects/metabolism\r\nSucrose\r\nAdult neurogenesis\r\nCell proliferation\r\nCorticosterone\r\nCreatine\r\nDepression\r\nHippocampus\r\nNeuronal differentiation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pazini FL, Cunha MP, Azevedo D, Rosa JM, Colla A, de Oliveira J, Ramos-Hryb AB, Brocardo PS, Gil-Mohapel J, and Rodrigues ALS (2017) Creatine Prevents Corticosterone-Induced Reduction in Hippocampal Proliferation and Differentiation: Possible Implication for Its Antidepressant Effect..

In this context, several nutraceuticals have been investigated regarding their possible beneficial effects for the management of this neuropsychiatric disorder. Creatine stands out as a supplement frequently used for ergogenic purpose, but it also is a neuroprotective compound with potential to treat or mitigate a broad range of central nervous systems diseases, including depression.

The focus is given on the possible molecular mechanisms underlying its effects based on the results obtained with different animal models of depression.

Although this strain of mouse is sensitive to stress, daily administration of Arg at 3 mg/kg significantly suppressed aging-related cognitive decline and behavioral depression at nine months of age and counteracted stress-induced shortened lifespan. To investigate the mechanism of the anti-stress effect of Arg in the brain, early changes in oxidative damage and gene expression levels were measured using SAMP10 mice that were stress-loaded for three days. Increased lipid peroxidation in the brains of stressed mice was significantly lowered by Arg intake. Several genes associated with oxidative stress response and neuronal excitotoxic cell death, including Nr4a1, Arc, and Cyr61, remarkably increased in response to psychosocial stress; however, their expression was significantly suppressed in mice that ingested Arg even under stress conditions. In contrast, the genes that maintain mitochondrial functions and neuronal survival, including Hba-a2 and Hbb-b2, were significantly increased in mice that ingested Arg. These results indicate that Arg reduces oxidative damage and enhances mitochondrial functions in the brain. We suggest that the daily intake of Arg plays important roles in reducing stress-induced brain damage and slowing aging.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pervin M ; Unno K ; Konishi T ; Nakamura Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ijms22020508 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nArginine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nCognitive Dysfunction/physiopathology/*prevention & control\r\nCysteine-Rich Protein 61/genetics\r\nDepression/physiopathology/*prevention & control\r\nGene Expression Profiling/methods\r\nGene Expression Regulation/drug effects\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism/physiology\r\nLearning/drug effects\r\nLongevity/*drug effects/physiology\r\nMale\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL\r\nNuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1/genetics\r\nOxidative Stress/drug effects\r\nStress, Physiological/*drug effects/physiology\r\nSurvival Analysis\r\naging\r\narginine\r\nbrain\r\nchronic psychosocial stress\r\ndepression\r\noxidative damage\r\nshortened lifespan","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pervin M, Unno K, Konishi T, and Nakamura Y (2021) L-Arginine Exerts Excellent Anti-Stress Effects on Stress-Induced Shortened Lifespan, Cognitive Decline and Depression..

A wide array of measures were made. The 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17); the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A); Sheehan Disability Scale; Quality of Life; Clinical Global Impression (CGI); anthropometrics measures; and vital signs and biochemical laboratory. There were no significant differences among the groups regarding demographic, clinical features, use of medication, metabolic syndrome and comorbidities. From baseline to week 12, individuals receiving NAC, versus placebo, had a statistically significant reduction in depressive symptoms on HDRS(17) (p < 0.01) and anxiety symptoms on HAM-A (p = 0.04), but only for individuals with levels of hs-CRP > 3 mg/L at baseline. Individuals receiving NAC with baseline levels of hs-CRP > 3 mg/L, had more significant reduction in uric acid levels compared to individuals with baseline levels of hs-CRP ≤ 3 mg/L on week 12. Participants receiving placebogained significantly more weight during the 12 weeks for baseline levels of hs-CRP ≤ 3 mg/L and hs-CRP > 3 mg/L, and individuals receiving NAC in both groups did not have significant weight change during the 12 weeks. No individuals were withdrawn from the study because of adverse event. NAC group exhibited significantly greater reduction on hs-CRP levels than placebo group from baseline to week 12.

In preclinical studies, antidepressants had significant effects on 5-HT receptor sensitivity. In the clinical setting, the pharmacologic challenge paradigm has generated interest as a means of studying 5-HT function. Most frequently used in these studies has been intravenous L-tryptophan (L-TRP), which increases serum prolactin (PRL). The authors review the neuroendocrine effects of intravenous L-TRP in depression and other conditions, as well as the effects of thymoleptic drugs on the PRL response to L-TRP. Findings are discussed in light of recent evidence that experimentally reduced plasma TRP can reverse the therapeutic effects of some antidepressants.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Price LH ; Charney DS ; Delgado PL ; Goodman WK ; Krystal JH ; Woods SW ; Heninger GR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/diagnosis/drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nHumans\r\nProlactin/blood\r\nReceptors, Serotonin/drug effects/physiology\r\nSerotonin/*physiology\r\nSerotonin Antagonists/pharmacology\r\nTryptophan/pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Price LH, Charney DS, Delgado PL, Goodman WK, Krystal JH, Woods SW, and Heninger GR (1990) Clinical data on the role of serotonin in the mechanism(s) of action of antidepressant drugs..

METHOD: One hundred twenty-six drug-free patients with DSM-III-R major depression (109 unipolar, 17 bipolar; 68 melancholic, 58 nonmelancholic; 28 psychotic, and 98 nonpsychotic patients) and 58 healthy comparison subjects participated. After an overnight fast, subjects received an intravenous infusion of L-tryptophan, 7 g. Blood was obtained for determination of serum prolactin, serum growth hormone (GH), and plasma tryptophan levels. Visual analogue scales were used to assess mood. RESULTS: Prolactin responses were blunted in nonmelancholic and higher in melancholic and psychotic depressed patients, while GH responses were blunted in combined unipolar, nonmelancholic, and nonpsychotic depressed patients. Controlling for baseline biological, clinical, and demographic factors eliminated the higher prolactin response in the melancholic and psychotic patients, attenuated the blunted GH response in the unipolar patients, and revealed a blunted GH response in the melancholic patients. Patients and comparison subjects differed on five of 13 mood responses, primarily because of baseline differences. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with previous studies demonstrating blunted neuroendocrine responses to intravenous L-tryptophan in depression. Restriction of these findings to specific subtypes of depression may reflect a differential role of serotonergic abnormalities in these subtypes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Price LH ; Charney DS ; Delgado PL ; Heninger GR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/ajp.148.11.1518 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAffect/drug effects/*physiology\r\nBipolar Disorder/blood/physiopathology/psychology\r\nDepressive Disorder/blood/*physiopathology/psychology\r\nFemale\r\nGrowth Hormone/blood\r\nHumans\r\nInfusions, Intravenous\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nProlactin/blood\r\nSerotonin/*physiology\r\nTryptophan/administration & dosage/*pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Price LH, Charney DS, Delgado PL, and Heninger GR (1991) Serotonin function and depression: neuroendocrine and mood responses to intravenous L-tryptophan in depressed patients and healthy comparison subjects..

In addition to these symptoms, depression is a common finding affecting 40% of patients with IPD. This study evaluates the effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, citalopram, on motor and nonmotor symptoms of depressed and nondepressed patients with IPD. Forty-six nondemented patients with IPD (24 men, 22 women; mean age 64 +/- 5.3 years; mean +/- SD disease duration, 6.4 +/- 3.2 years; mean +/- SD Hoehn-Yahr stage, 2.8 +/- 1.2) were included in the study. Patients were divided in two subgroups: depressed (n = 18) and nondepressed (n = 28). Citalopram was added in an unblinded manner, starting with 10 mg/d, and, after a week, increased up to 20 mg/d in the depressed subgroup (n = 18) and in half of the nondepressed subgroup (n = 14). Parkinsonian and depressive symptoms were evaluated before and after 1 and 4 months of treatment. Statistical evaluation was made by analysis of variance for repeated measures. Citalopram did not worsen motor performance in IPD, but improved bradykinesia and finger taps after 1 month and 4 months of treatment both in patients with and without depression (p < 0.05 versus baseline). A clear improvement in mood was also observed in 15 of 16 patients with depression. Although case reports indicate that citalopram can potentially worsen the motor symptoms in patients with PD, to date this effect has not been confirmed. Many of the symptoms, typically associated with depression, can be observed in nondepressed patients with IPD, because signs thought to represent depression can be produced by Parkinson's disease. In this study, we observed that when combined with levodopa, citalopram induces an improvement of motor performance, in particular of subscores 23 and 31 of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale both in depressed and in nondepressed patients with IPD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rampello L ; Chiechio S ; Raffaele R ; Vecchio I ; Nicoletti F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/00002826-200201000-00004 ","Keywords":"Affect/drug effects\r\nAntiparkinson Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nCarbidopa/therapeutic use\r\nCitalopram/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/complications/drug therapy\r\nDopamine Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDrug Combinations\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nHypokinesia/*drug therapy/etiology/psychology\r\nLevodopa/*therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nParkinson Disease/complications/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nPsychomotor Performance/drug effects\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rampello L, Chiechio S, Raffaele R, Vecchio I, and Nicoletti F (2002) The SSRI, citalopram, improves bradykinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease treated with L-dopa..

The pro-inflammatory cytokines like interferon-γ induce the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. The induction of IDO reduces the availability of tryptophan for serotonin synthesis. Furthermore, the metabolites of kynurenine pathway have neurotoxic property, which along with decreased serotonin may account for depression-like illness. METHODS: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of treatment with fluoxetine and 1-methyl-L-tryptophan (1-MT) on Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-induced inflammatory model of depression in mice. Behavioral tests included locomotor activity, forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). Oxidative stress was assessed by examining the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) and non-protein thiols (NP-SH) in homogenized whole brain samples. Comet assays were performed to assess neurotoxicity. RESULTS: The results of this study demonstrate that BCG treatment resulted in an increase in duration of immobility in FST and TST as compared to the saline group. Further, it produced a significant increase in the brain TBARS levels and decrease in the brain NP-SH levels. The hippocampal tissue from BCG group had significantly more comet cells than the saline group. 1-MT and fluoxetine were able to reverse the BCG-induced depression-like behavior and the derangement in oxidative stress parameters.

While conventional antipsychotics are relatively effective on positive symptoms, their impact on negative and cognitive symptoms is limited. Recent studies have established a link between oxidative stress and neurocognitive deficits in psychosis. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a glutathione precursor with glutamatergic properties, has shown efficacy on negative symptoms and functioning in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, respectively. However, there are few evidence-based approaches for managing cognitive impairment in psychosis. The present study aims to examine the cognitive effects of adjunctive NAC treatment in a pooled subgroup of participants with psychosis who completed neuropsychological assessment in two trials of both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. METHOD: A sample of 58 participants were randomized in a double fashion to receive 2 g/day of NAC (n = 27) or placebo (n = 31) for 24 weeks. Attention, working memory and executive function domains were assessed. Differences between cognitive performance at baseline and end point were examined using Wilcoxon's test. The Mann-Whitney test was used to examine the differences between the NAC and placebo groups at the end point. RESULTS: Participants treated with NAC had significantly higher working memory performance at week 24 compared with placebo (U = 98.5, p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: NAC may have an impact on cognitive performance in psychosis, as a significant improvement in working memory was observed in the NAC-treated group compared with placebo; however, these preliminary data require replication. Glutamatergic compounds such as NAC may constitute a step towards the development of useful therapies for cognitive impairment in psychosis.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rapado-Castro M ; Dodd S ; Bush AI ; Malhi GS ; Skvarc DR ; On ZX ; Berk M ; Dean OM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S0033291716002932 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nAdult\r\nAttention/*drug effects\r\nBipolar Disorder/*complications\r\nCognitive Dysfunction/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nExecutive Function/*drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nFree Radical Scavengers/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMemory, Short-Term/*drug effects\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychotic Disorders/*complications\r\nSchizophrenia/*complications\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nN-acetyl cysteine\r\nCognition\r\nglutathione\r\npsychosis\r\nworking memory","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rapado-Castro M, Dodd S, Bush AI, Malhi GS, Skvarc DR, On ZX, Berk M, and Dean OM (2017) Cognitive effects of adjunctive N-acetyl cysteine in psychosis..

A revision of these guidelines was undertaken by CANMAT in 2008-2009 to reflect advances in the field. There is widespread interest in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: The CANMAT guidelines are based on a question-answer format to enhance accessibility to clinicians. An evidence-based format was used with updated systematic reviews of the literature and recommendations were graded according to Level of Evidence using pre-defined criteria. Lines of Treatment were identified based on criteria that included evidence and expert clinical support. This section on \"Complementary and Alternative Medicine Treatments\" is one of 5 guideline articles. RESULTS: There is Level 1 evidence to support light therapy in seasonal MDD and St. John's wort in mild to moderate MDD. There is also some evidence for the use of exercise, yoga and sleep deprivation, as well as for omega-3 fatty acids and SAM-e . Support for other natural health products and therapies is still limited. LIMITATIONS: The evidence base remains limited and studies often have methodological problems, including small samples, variability in dose, short duration of treatment, unknown quality of the agent and limited long-term data. Safety data are also sparse with little information about drug interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Some CAM treatments have evidence of benefit in MDD. However, problems with standardization and safety concerns may limit their applicability in clinical practice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ravindran AV ; Lam RW ; Filteau MJ ; Lespérance F ; Kennedy SH ; Parikh SV ; Patten SB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2009.06.040 ","Keywords":"Acupuncture Therapy\r\nAdult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\n*Complementary Therapies\r\nDehydroepiandrosterone/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nExercise Therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nHerbal Medicine\r\nHumans\r\nHypericum\r\nPhototherapy\r\nPhytotherapy\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use\r\nSleep Deprivation/psychology\r\nTryptophan/therapeutic use\r\nYoga","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ravindran AV, Lam RW, Filteau MJ, Lespérance F, Kennedy SH, Parikh SV, and Patten SB (2009) Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Clinical guidelines for the management of major depressive disorder in adults.

The benefits and risks of such combination strategies have not been fully evaluated. This paper evaluates the risk-benefit profile of CAM augmentation to antidepressants in affective conditions. METHODS: PubMed was searched for all available clinical reports published in English up to December 2012. Data were evaluated based on graded levels of evidence for efficacy and safety. RESULTS: Generally, the evidence base is significantly larger for depression than for anxiety disorder. In unipolar depression, there is Level 2 evidence for adjunctive sleep deprivation (SD) and Free and Easy Wanderer Plus (FEWP), and Level 3 for exercise, yoga, light therapy (LT), omega-3 fatty acids, S-adenosylmethionine and tryptophan. In bipolar depression, there is Level 1 evidence for adjunctive omega-3s, Level 2 for SD, and Level 3 for LT and FEWP. In anxiety conditions, exercise augmentation has Level 3 support in generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Though mostly well-tolerated, these therapies can only be recommended as third-line interventions due to the quality of available evidence. LIMITATIONS: Overall, the literature is limited. Studies often had methodological weaknesses, with little information on long-term use and on potential drug-CAM interactions. Many CAM studies were not published in English. CONCLUSIONS: While several CAM therapies show some evidence of benefit as augmentation in depressive disorders, such evidence is largely lacking in anxiety disorders. The general dearth of adequate safety and tolerability data encourages caution in clinical use.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ravindran AV ; da Silva TL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2013.05.042 ","Keywords":"Anxiety Disorders/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nComplementary Therapies/adverse effects/*methods\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMeditation\r\nMood Disorders/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nPhototherapy\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/therapeutic use\r\nTryptophan/therapeutic use\r\nYoga\r\nAnxiety disorders\r\nAugmentation\r\nCombination\r\nComplementary and alternative medicine\r\nDepressive disorders\r\nSystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ravindran AV, and da Silva TL (2013) Complementary and alternative therapies as add-on to pharmacotherapy for mood and anxiety disorders: a systematic review..

Women who are depressed during pregnancy are at a higher risk for preterm delivery, preeclampsia, birth difficulties, and postpartum depression. The treatment of depression in conventional medicine has focused on physiological factors that lead to impaired neurotransmitter function and treatments to improve neurotransmitter function. Pharmaceutical substances pose risks for pregnant and lactating women, and lower risk options are preferred. Micronutrients, including certain B vitamins, folate, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), play a role in the synthesis and absorption of neurotransmitters. Experimental studies suggest that supplementation with specific micronutrients may alleviate depressive symptoms and improve birth outcomes in patients with perinatal depression. Alternative treatments for depression, including nutritional supplements, are an important treatment option for depressive symptoms while limiting potential side effects and treatment costs. This article explores the biological basis of perinatal depression and reviews the potential benefits of non-pharmacological interventions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rechenberg K ; Humphries D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Brain/physiopathology\r\nDepression/*diet therapy/drug therapy\r\nDepression, Postpartum/*diet therapy/drug therapy\r\nFatty Acids, Unsaturated/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHomocysteine/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\n*Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nPregnancy\r\ndepression\r\nnutrition\r\nperinatal depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rechenberg K, and Humphries D (2013) Nutritional interventions in depression and perinatal depression..

Oral creatine supplementation may modify brain high-energy phosphate metabolism in depressed subjects. METHODS: Eight unipolar and two bipolar patients with treatment-resistant depression were treated for four weeks with 3-5 g/day of creatine monohydrate in an open add-on design. Outcome measures were the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and Clinical Global Impression scores, recorded at baseline and at weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4. RESULTS: One patient improved considerably after one week and withdrew. Both bipolar patients developed hypomania/mania. For the remaining seven patients, all scale scores significantly improved. Adverse reactions were mild and transitory. CONCLUSIONS: This small, preliminary, open study of creatine monohydrate suggests a beneficial effect of creatine augmentation in unipolar depression, but possible precipitation of a manic switch in bipolar depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Roitman S ; Green T ; Osher Y ; Karni N ; Levine J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1399-5618.2007.00532.x ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAdult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/chemically induced/*drug therapy/*metabolism/psychology\r\nBrain/drug effects/metabolism\r\nCreatine/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\r\nDrug Resistance\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nEnergy Metabolism/drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPhosphates/metabolism\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Roitman S, Green T, Osher Y, Karni N, and Levine J (2007) Creatine monohydrate in resistant depression: a preliminary study..

Taking into account that oxidative stress has been associated with depressive disorders, this study investigated the possibility that GSH, a major cell antioxidant, elicits an antidepressant-like effect in mice. Thus, GSH was administered by i.c.v. route to mice that were tested in the forced swimming test and in the tail suspension test, two predictive tests for antidepressant drug activity. In addition, GSH metabolism and the redox environment were modulated in order to study the possible mechanisms underlying the effects of GSH in the forced swimming test. The administration of GSH decreased the immobility time in the forced swimming test (300-3000nmol/site) and tail suspension test (100-1000nmol/site), consistent with an antidepressant-like effect. GSH depletion elicited by l-buthionine sulfoximine (3.2μmol/site, i.c.v.) did not alter the antidepressant-like effect of GSH, whereas the inhibition of extracellular GSH catabolism by acivicin (100nmol/site, i.c.v.) prevented the antidepressant-like effect of GSH. Moreover, a sub-effective dose (0.01nmol/site, i.c.v.) of the oxidizing agent DTNB (5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) potentiated the effect of GSH (100nmol/site, i.c.v.), while the pretreatment (25-100mg/kg, i.p.) with the reducing agent DTT (dl-dithiothreitol) prevented the antidepressant-like effect of GSH (300nmol/site, i.c.v.). DTNB (0.1nmol/site, i.c.v.), produced an antidepressant-like effect, per se, which was abolished by DTT (25mg/kg, i.p.). The results show, for the first time, that centrally administered GSH produces an antidepressant-like effect in mice, which can be modulated by the GSH metabolism and the thiol/disulfide reagents.

In addition, non-cognitive symptoms are reported in AD patients, such as anxiety, apathy and depressed mood. The current antidepressant drugs present reduced efficacy to improve depressive symptoms in AD patients. Here, we investigated the ability of creatine, a compound with neuroprotective and antidepressant properties, to counteract amyloid β(1-40) peptide-induced depressive-like behavior in mice. Moreover, we addressed the participation of the intracellular signaling pathway mediated by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)/nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf(2)) in the creatine effects. Aß(1-40) administration (400 pmol/mouse, i.c.v.) increased the immobility time in the tail suspension test and decreased the grooming time and increased latency to grooming in the splash test, indicative of depressive-like behavior. These impairments were attenuated by creatine (0.01 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) and fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, p.o., positive control). No significant alterations on locomotor performance were observed in the open field. Aß(1-40) administration did not alter hippocampal phospho-GSK-3β (Ser(9))/total GSK-3β, total GSK-3β and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) immunocontents. However, Aß(1-40)-infused mice treated with creatine (0.01 mg/kg) presented increased phosphorylation of GSK-3β(Ser(9)) and HO-1 immunocontent in the hippocampus. Fluoxetine per se increased GSK-3β(Ser(9)) phosphorylation, but did not alter HO-1 levels. In addition, Aß(1-40) administration increased hippocampal glutathione (GSH) levels as well as glutathione reductase (GR) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activities, and these effects were abolished by creatine and fluoxetine. This study provides the first evidence of the antidepressive-like effects of creatine in Aß(1-40)-treated mice, which were accompanied by hippocampal inhibition of GSK-3β and modulation of antioxidant defenses. These findings indicate the potential of creatine for the treatment of depression associated with AD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rosa JM ; Pazini FL ; Cunha MP ; Colla ARS ; Manosso LM ; Mancini G ; Souza ACG ; de Bem AF ; Prediger RD ; Rodrigues ALS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.05.001 ","Keywords":"Amyloid beta-Peptides\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nCreatine/*pharmacology\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nFemale\r\nFluoxetine/pharmacology\r\nGlutathione/metabolism\r\nGlutathione Reductase/metabolism\r\nGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/*metabolism\r\nHeme Oxygenase-1/metabolism\r\nHippocampus/drug effects/metabolism\r\nMembrane Proteins/metabolism\r\nMice\r\nNF-E2-Related Factor 2/*metabolism\r\nPeptide Fragments\r\nPhosphorylation/drug effects\r\nSignal Transduction/drug effects\r\nThioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase/metabolism\r\nAmyloid β(1–40) peptide\r\nAntidepressant\r\nCreatine\r\nGlycogen synthase kinase-3β\r\nHeme oxygenase","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rosa JM, Pazini FL, Cunha MP, Colla ARS, Manosso LM, Mancini G, Souza ACG, de Bem AF, Prediger RD, and Rodrigues ALS (2018) Antidepressant effects of creatine on amyloid β(1-40)-treated mice: The role of GSK-3β/Nrf(2) pathway..

METHODS: This 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included subjects aged 18-60 years with mild-to-moderate depression (according to ICD-10 diagnostic criteria) recruited from September 17, 2018, to October 5, 2018. Difference between groups in change from baseline to treatment week 6 on the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (Z-SDS) was the primary outcome. Comparisons between groups in change from baseline to treatment week 2 of the Z-SDS and from baseline to treatment weeks 2 and 6 of other scales (related to insomnia, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, and health status) were also analyzed. RESULTS: Ninety patients were randomized to SAMe plus L. plantarum HEAL9 (n = 46) or placebo (n = 44) groups. A greater reduction for the new combination compared to placebo was seen at treatment week 6 in the Z-SDS total score (P = .0165) and the core depression subdomain (P = .0247). A significant reduction in favor of the combination was shown at treatment week 2 for the Z-SDS total score (P = .0330), the cognitive and anxiety subdomains (P = .0133 and P = .0459, respectively), and the anxiety questionnaire (P = .0345). No treatment-related adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of SAMe and L. plantarum HEAL9 in adults with subthreshold or mild-to-moderate symptoms of depression resulted in fast and clinically relevant effects after 2 weeks. The combination was safe and significantly improved symptoms of depression, anxiety, and cognitive and somatic components. The effect of this novel product is independent from the severity of the symptoms unlike traditional antidepressants available on the market that have minimal benefits for subthreshold or mild-to-moderate symptoms.

The objective of this analysis was to address whether a dose increase provided further improvement in cases of insufficient response using data from an existing randomized clinical trial. METHODS: Sixty-five patients with MDD who failed to respond to SAMe 1,600 mg/day, escitalopram 10 mg/day, or placebo for 6 weeks were treated with doubled doses of the allocated treatments for the following 6 weeks. Changes in 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated, and Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events-Specific Inquiry were compared between the lower and higher dose treatments in each treatment group and among the higher dose treatments of SAMe, escitalopram, and placebo. RESULTS: Various depression severity scores decreased significantly for all three treatment arms during the higher dose treatment. No within-group and between-group differences were found in any of the efficacy measures when comparing the doses and treatments. There was a significant difference in reported abdominal discomfort among patients receiving the higher dose of SAMe (31.3%), compared to escitalopram (8.7%) and placebo (3.8%) (χ2=7.32, p = 0.026). LIMITATIONS: The sample size was relatively small. The study duration for dose increase was relatively short. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MDD failing to respond to 1,600 mg/day of SAMe may improve after increasing the dose to 3,200 mg/day, but we cannot rule out the contribution of a placebo effect and time-related improvement. The risk of abdominal discomfort may be increased with higher doses of SAMe.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sakurai H ; L Carpenter L; R Tyrka A; Price LH ; I Papakostas G; Dording CM ; Yeung AS ; Cusin C ; Ludington E ; Bernard-Negron R ; Fava M ; Mischoulon D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2019.10.040 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nCitalopram/*administration & dosage\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/*administration & dosage\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nDose escalation\r\nEscitalopram\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nS-adenosyl methionine, SAMe","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sakurai H, L Carpenter L, R Tyrka A, Price LH, I Papakostas G, Dording CM, Yeung AS, Cusin C, Ludington E, Bernard-Negron R, Fava M, and Mischoulon D (2020) Dose increase of S-Adenosyl-Methionine and escitalopram in a randomized clinical trial for major depressive disorder..

However, the mechanisms behind these effects have been poorly investigated. Since SAMe is involved in monoamine metabolism, this work aimed at 1) testing the effects induced by systemic treatment with SAMe in mice submitted to the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST); 2) investigating the involvement of serotonergic neurotransmission in the behavioral effects induced by SAMe. To do that, male Swiss mice received systemic injections (1 injection/day, 1 or 7 days) of imipramine (30 mg/kg), L-methionine (400, 800, 1600, and 3200 mg/kg), SAMe (10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg), or vehicle (10 ml/kg) and were submitted to the FST or TST, 30 min after the last injection. The effect of SAMe (50 mg/kg) was further investigated in independent groups of male Swiss mice pretreated with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, serotonin synthesis inhibitor, 150 mg/kg daily, 4 days) or with WAY100635 (5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, 0.1 mg/kg, 1 injection). One independent group was submitted to the FST and euthanized immediately after for collection of brain samples for neurochemical analyses. Serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) levels were measured in the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Furthermore, to investigate if the treatments used could induce any significant exploratory/motor effect which would interfere with the FST results, the animals were also submitted to the open field test (OFT). The administration of imipramine (30 mg/kg), L-methionine (400, 800, 1600, and 3200 mg/kg), and SAMe (10 and 50 mg/kg) reduced the immobility time in the FST, an effect blocked by pretreatment with PCPA and WAY100635. None of the treatments increased the locomotion in the OFT. In conclusion, our results suggest that the antidepressant-like effects induced by SAMe treatment are dependent on serotonin synthesis and 5-HT(1A) receptor activation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sales AJ ; Maciel IS ; Crestani CC ; Guimarães FS ; Joca SR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuint.2022.105442 ","Keywords":"Male\r\nMice\r\nAnimals\r\n*Serotonin/metabolism\r\n*S-Adenosylmethionine/pharmacology\r\nImipramine/pharmacology\r\nDepression/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nReceptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nSerotonin Antagonists/pharmacology\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors\r\nSwimming\r\n5-HT\r\n5-HT1A\r\nDepression\r\nS-adenosyl-l-methionine\r\nSAMe\r\nSerotonin\r\nStress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sales AJ, Maciel IS, Crestani CC, Guimarães FS, and Joca SR (2023) S-adenosyl-l-methionine antidepressant-like effects involve activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors..

In random order they received infusions of 800 mg SAMe and placebo, administered over 30 minutes for 7 days, with a wash-out period of 3 weeks in between. EEG recordings and psychometric tests were carried out 0, 1, 3 and 6 hours after drug administration on days 1 and 7. Multivariate analysis based on MANOVA/Hotelling T(2) tests demonstrated significant central effects of SAMe as compared with placebo after acute, subacute and superimposed drug administration. Acute SAMe-induced changes were characterized by a decrease in total power, an increase in absolute delta and a decrease in absolute alpha power, further by an increase in relative delta and a decrease in relative alpha power, a slowing of the delta/theta centroid as well as a slowing of the centroid of the total power spectrum. These changes are typical of classical antidepressants of the thymoleptic type such as imipramine and amitriptyline. After one week of daily infusions there was a marked increase in total power, reminiscent of nootropic drug effects. One additional superimposed dosage mitigated these effects in the direction of an antidepressant profile, with the inter-drug differences waning in the 6(th) hour. Our pharmaco-EEG findings suggest both inhibitory and excitatory drug effects underlying the antidepressant properties of SAMe well-documented in clinical trials. Psychometric tests concerning noopsychic and thymopsychic measures as well as critical flicker frequency generally demonstrated a lack of differences between SAMe and placebo, which again reflects a good tolerability of the drug in elderly subjects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Saletu B ; Anderer P ; Linzmayer L ; Semlitsch HV ; Lindeck-Pozza E ; Assandri A ; di Padova C ; Saletu-Zyhlarz GM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00702-002-0768-6 ","Keywords":"Aged\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nBrain/*drug effects\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nElectroencephalography/*drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMultivariate Analysis\r\nPsychometrics\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/*administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Saletu B, Anderer P, Linzmayer L, Semlitsch HV, Lindeck-Pozza E, Assandri A, di Padova C, and Saletu-Zyhlarz GM (2002) Pharmacodynamic studies on the central mode of action of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) infusions in elderly subjects, utilizing EEG mapping and psychometry..

It revealed a number of significant conclusions. Interestingly, more positive clinical trials were found to support adjuvant, rather than monotherapeutic, use of nutrients to treat depression. Much evidence exists in the area of adjuvant application of folic acid, S-adenosyl-methionine, omega-3, and L-tryptophan with antidepressants. Current evidence does not support omega-3 as an effective monotherapy to treat depression. However, this may be due, at least in part, to olive oil being used as the control intervention, some studies using docosahexaenoic acid alone or a higher docosahexaenoic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid ratio, and significant heterogeneity regarding depressive populations. Nevertheless, adjunctive prescription of omega-3 with antidepressants, or in people with dietary deficiency, may be beneficial. Inositol lacks evidence as an effective antidepressant and cannot be currently recommended. Evidence on the use of L-tryptophan for depression is inconclusive, and additional studies utilizing a more robust methodology are required.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sarris J ; Schoendorfer N ; Kavanagh DJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1753-4887.2009.00180.x ","Keywords":"Amino Acids/administration & dosage\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage\r\nChemotherapy, Adjuvant\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDocosahexaenoic Acids/administration & dosage\r\nEicosapentaenoic Acid/administration & dosage\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage\r\nFolic Acid/administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\n*Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nNutritional Status\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/administration & dosage\r\nTryptophan/administration & dosage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sarris J, Schoendorfer N, and Kavanagh DJ (2009) Major depressive disorder and nutritional medicine: a review of monotherapies and adjuvant treatments..

Recent evidence suggests that synthetic antidepressants- although effective in the treatment of severe depressed mood-may have only a weak effect against mild-moderate forms of depression. In such cases, nonpharmaceutical options may be indicated. Furthermore, research findings suggest that select natural products are effective adjuvants when combined with synthetic antidepressants. Research concerning the treatment of depression emphasizes individual monotherapies, which is often incongruent with clinical reality. In practice, clinicians often use a variety of interventions; however, this approach may not be systematic, and many interventions used may not be based on strong evidence. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: This article proposes an evidence-based prescriptive clinical model based on the biopsychosocial model to treat unipolar depression. The \"Antidepressant-Lifestyle- Psychological-Social (ALPS) depression treatment model\" integrates nonpharmacological interventions (such as complementary medicines, lifestyle advice, and psychosocial techniques) for use by clinicians. RESULTS: Initially a review of nonpharmacological mood-elevating interventions was undertaken. Evidentiary support was revealed for use of psychological techniques such as cognitive and behavioral medicine and interpersonal therapy, St John's wort, S-adenosyl methionine, and aerobic and anaerobic exercise. There were inconsistent research findings for acupuncture, omega-3 fish oils, and L-tryptophan for depressed mood. From these evidencebased interventions an integrative model was formed. Clinical recommendations in addition to a practical stepped-care decision tree are outlined. CONCLUSION: The ALPS model has the potential to improve treatment outcomes and reduce relapse rates in clinical depression and warrants research using rigorous and appropriate methodology.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sarris J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"5-Hydroxytryptophan/therapeutic use\r\nComplementary Therapies/*methods\r\nDepressive Disorder/psychology/*therapy\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFolic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nHypericum\r\nIntegrative Medicine/*methods\r\n*Life Style\r\nPhytotherapy/methods\r\nQuality of Life\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sarris J (2011) Clinical depression: an evidence-based integrative complementary medicine treatment model..

Population surveys show that persons with BD often self-medicate with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) or integrative therapies in spite of limited research evidence supporting their use. To date, no review has focused specifically on nonconventional treatments of BD. OBJECTIVES: The study objectives were to present a review of nonconventional (complementary and integrative) interventions examined in clinical trials on BD, and to offer provisional guidelines for the judicious integrative use of CAM in the management of BD. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL,(®) Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for human clinical trials in English during mid-2010 using Bipolar Disorder and CAM therapy and CAM medicine search terms. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were also calculated where data were available. RESULTS: Several positive high-quality studies on nutrients in combination with conventional mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications in BD depression were identified, while branched-chain amino acids and magnesium were effective (small studies) in attenuating mania in BD. In the treatment of bipolar depression, evidence was mixed regarding omega-3, while isolated studies provide provisional support for a multinutrient formula, n-acetylcysteine, and l-tryptophan. In one study, acupuncture was found to have favorable but nonsignificant effects on mania and depression outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supports the integrative treatment of BD using combinations of mood stabilizers and select nutrients. Other CAM or integrative modalities used to treat BD have not been adequately explored to date; however, some early findings are promising. Select CAM and integrative interventions add to established conventional treatment of BD and may be considered when formulating a treatment plan. It is hoped that the safety issues and clinical considerations addressed in this article may encourage the practice of safety-conscious and evidence-based integrative management of BD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sarris J ; Lake J ; Hoenders R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1089/acm.2010.0481 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/therapeutic use\r\nAcupuncture Therapy\r\nAmino Acids, Branched-Chain/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/therapy\r\n*Complementary Therapies/adverse effects\r\n*Dietary Supplements/adverse effects\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\n*Integrative Medicine\r\nMagnesium/therapeutic use\r\nMicronutrients/therapeutic use\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/therapeutic use\r\nTryptophan/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sarris J, Lake J, and Hoenders R (2011) Bipolar disorder and complementary medicine: current evidence, safety issues, and clinical considerations..

To date, however, no specialized systematic review of this area has been conducted. We present the first systematic review of clinical trials using nutrient-based nutraceuticals in combination with standard pharmacotherapies to treat BD. A subsequent aim of this report was to discuss posited underlying mechanisms of action. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases, and grey literature were searched during mid-2010 for human clinical trials in English using nutraceuticals such as omega-3, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), inositol, and vitamins and minerals, in combination with pharmacotherapies to treat bipolar mania and bipolar depression. A review of the results including an effect size analysis (Cohen's d) was subsequently conducted. RESULTS: In treating bipolar depression, positive evidence with large effect sizes were found for NAC (d=1.04) and a chelated mineral and vitamin formula (d=1.70). On the outcome of bipolar mania, several nutraceuticals reduced mania with strong clinical effects: a chelated mineral formula (d=0.83), L-tryptophan (d=1.47), magnesium (d=1.44), folic acid (d=0.40), and branched-chain amino acids (d=1.60). Mixed, but mainly positive, evidence was found for omega-3 for bipolar depression, while no evidentiary support was found for use in mania. No significant effect on BD outcome scales was found for inositol (possibly due to small samples). CONCLUSIONS: BD treatment outcomes may potentially be improved by additional use of certain nutraceuticals with conventional pharmacotherapies. However, caution should be extended in interpreting the large effects of several isolated studies, as they have not yet been replicated in larger trials.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sarris J ; Mischoulon D ; Schweitzer I ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1399-5618.2011.00945.x ","Keywords":"Amino Acids/therapeutic use\r\nAntimanic Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*diet therapy/*drug therapy\r\n*Clinical Trials as Topic/methods/standards\r\nDatabases, Factual/statistics & numerical data\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMinerals/therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVitamins/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sarris J, Mischoulon D, and Schweitzer I (2011) Adjunctive nutraceuticals with standard pharmacotherapies in bipolar disorder: a systematic review of clinical trials..

METHODS: We examined a subsample (n=144) from one site of a two-site study of adults with diagnosed Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), recruited from 4/13/05 to 12/22/09, who consented to the additional blood draw for serum histamine and carnitine levels. After washout, eligible subjects were randomized to SAMe (1600-3200mg/daily), escitalopram (10-20mg/daily), or matching placebo for 12 weeks of double-blind treatment (titration at week 6 in non-response). RESULTS: On the primary outcome of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), a significant difference in improvement was observed between groups from baseline to week 12 (p=0.039). The effect size from baseline to endpoint was moderate to large for SAMe versus placebo (d=0.74). SAMe was superior to placebo from week 1, and to escitalopram during weeks 2, 4, and 6. No significant effect was found between escitalopram and placebo or SAMe. Response rates (HAMD-17≥50% reduction) at endpoint were 45%, 31%, and 26% for SAMe, escitalopram, and placebo, respectively; while remission rates (HAM-D≤7) were 34% for SAMe (p=0.003), 23% for escitalopram (p=0.023), and 6% for placebo. No correlation between baseline histamine level and reduction of HAMD-17 score was found for either the SAMe or escitalopram groups. Baseline carnitine levels were also not found to moderate response to either treatment. LIMITATIONS: While SAMe appears to be an effective antidepressant agent, the overall findings from the parent study (which showed no significant difference between groups due to site differences) must be taken into consideration. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results provide encouraging evidence for the use of SAMe in the treatment of MDD. Histamine and carnitine serum level may not necessarily moderate response to SAMe.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sarris J ; Papakostas GI ; Vitolo O ; Fava M ; Mischoulon D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2014.03.041 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBiomarkers/blood\r\nCarnitine/*blood\r\nCitalopram/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/blood/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHistamine/*blood\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/*therapeutic use\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nCarnitine\r\nDepression\r\nHistamine\r\nOne-carbon cycle\r\nRCT\r\nS-adenosyl methionine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sarris J, Papakostas GI, Vitolo O, Fava M, and Mischoulon D (2014) S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) versus escitalopram and placebo in major depression RCT: efficacy and effects of histamine and carnitine as moderators of response..

METHODS: Data from a 2-site, 12-week, double-blind RCT (n=189) assessing the efficacy of SAMe vs. placebo and a comparator selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (escitalopram) were subjected to post-hoc analyses to evaluate effects of patient gender on treatment response. RESULTS: When assessing the efficacy outcomes within each gender separately, SAMe was superior to placebo among males (n=51), but not among females (n=62). Males showed a significant reduction of depression severity from baseline to study endpoint on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (4.3 point difference; p=0.034; d=0.95), while females did not show significant change. This finding emerged despite equivalence on baseline measures of depression severity between the gender groups. CONCLUSION: RESULTS of this secondary data analysis suggest that gender might impact the antidepressant efficacy of SAMe, with greater therapeutic effect found in males. The underlying mechanism is still relatively unknown. Further work is needed to replicate this observation in independent samples.Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00101452.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sarris J ; Price LH ; Carpenter LL ; Tyrka AR ; Ng CH ; Papakostas GI ; Jaeger A ; Fava M ; Mischoulon D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1055/s-0035-1549928 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/*therapeutic use\r\nCitalopram/therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/*therapeutic use\r\n*Sex Characteristics","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sarris J, Price LH, Carpenter LL, Tyrka AR, Ng CH, Papakostas GI, Jaeger A, Fava M, and Mischoulon D (2015) Is S-Adenosyl Methionine (SAMe) for Depression Only Effective in Males?

METHOD: The authors report on three patients infected with chronic hepatitis C showing severe depressive symptoms during or after IFN(alpha) treatment. Because patients had lowered tryptophan blood levels and did not response to antidepressants, they received tryptophan up to a dosage of 1,000 mg/day as mono- or add-on treatment. RESULTS: Tryptophan, used as augmentation or monotherapeutic treatment, led to a significant improvement of depressive symptoms in all three patients.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether 5-HTP and tryptophan are more effective than placebo, and whether they are safe to use to treat depressive disorders in adults. SEARCH STRATEGY: Trials were searched in computerized general (Medline, Psychlit, and Embase) and specialized databases (Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register, Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trial Register); by checking reference lists of relevant articles; by handsearching relevant specialist journals; and by contacting relevant authors where appropriate.

METHODS: A systematic review of the literature from 1966 to 2000 using the search terms 'tryptophan', 5-hydroxytryptophan', '5-HTP', '5-HT' and 'depression'. We extracted and grouped data for meta-analysis by pooling odds ratios (OR) and relative risks where possible. RESULTS: One hundred and eight studies were located of which only two studies, one of 5-HT and one of L-tryptophan, with a total of 64 patients met sufficient quality criteria to be included. These studies suggest 5-HT and L-tryptophan are better than placebo at alleviating depression (Peto OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 1.3-13.2). However, the small size of the studies, and the large number of inadmissible, poorly executed studies, casts doubt on the result from potential publication bias, and suggests that they are insufficiently evaluated to assess their effectiveness. CONCLUSION: A large body of evidence was subjected to very basic criteria for assessing reliability and validity, and was found to largely be of insufficient quality to inform clinical practice. More well-designed studies are urgently required to enable an assessment of what may be an effective class of agents.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shaw K ; Turner J ; Del Mar C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1046/j.1440-1614.2002.01046.x ","Keywords":"5-Hydroxytryptophan/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nTryptophan/adverse effects/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shaw K, Turner J, and Del Mar C (2002) Are tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan effective treatments for depression?

This study aims to investigate the effects of L-theanine (2 mg/kg) on monoamine levels in an animal model of depression. The effect of l-theanine on the symptoms of depression was examined through the open-field test, sucrose preference test, and forced swim test. The monoamine neurotransmitters that involve serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA) were measured in the limbic-cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic (LCSPT)-circuit related brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAC), striatum (ST), amygdala, and hippocampus (HIP). L-theanine ameliorated the depressive-like behaviors in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model. In the PFC, NAC, and HIP, L-theanine administration significantly increased the levels of 5-HT, NE, and DA. In the ST, the levels of 5-HT and DA were increased after the administration of L-theanine. However, in the HIP, only the level of DA significantly changed after the treatment of L-theanine. Taken together, these results indicated that L-theanine has possibly antidepressant-like effects in the CUMS rat model, which could be mediated by the monoamine neurotransmitters in the LCSPT-circuit related brain regions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shen M ; Yang Y ; Wu Y ; Zhang B ; Wu H ; Wang L ; Tang H ; Chen J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/ptr.6237 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBrain/drug effects\r\nCorpus Striatum/drug effects\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDopamine/metabolism\r\nGlutamates/*pharmacology\r\nHippocampus/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nNeurotransmitter Agents/metabolism\r\nNorepinephrine/metabolism\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nStress, Psychological/*drug therapy\r\nSwimming\r\nTea\r\nL-theanine\r\nantidepressant effect\r\nchronic unpredictable mild stress\r\nmonoamine neurotransmitters","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shen M, Yang Y, Wu Y, Zhang B, Wu H, Wang L, Tang H, and Chen J (2019) L-theanine ameliorate depressive-like behavior in a chronic unpredictable mild stress rat model via modulating the monoamine levels in limbic-cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic-circuit related brain regions..

SAM-e may be a treatment alternative for the management of depression in a population reluctant to add another \"pill\" or another set of related side effects to an already complex highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen. METHODS: The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to assess depressive symptomatology from 1,2,4,6 and 8 weeks after initiation of treatment with SAM-e. RESULTS: Data show a significant acute reduction in depressive symptomatology, as measured by both the HAM-D and the BDI instruments. CONCLUSIONS: SAM-e has a rapid effect evident as soon as week 1 (p < .001), with progressive decreases in depression symptom rating scores throughout the 8 week study.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shippy RA ; Mendez D ; Jones K ; Cergnul I ; Karpiak SE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1471-244X-4-38 ","Keywords":"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications/drug therapy/*psychology\r\nAdult\r\nAntiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nHIV Infections/complications/drug therapy/*psychology\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPersonality Inventory\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/*therapeutic use\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shippy RA, Mendez D, Jones K, Cergnul I, and Karpiak SE (2004) S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e) for the treatment of depression in people living with HIV/AIDS..

The aim of this paper was to examine N-acetylcysteine (NAC) - a putative precursor of the most important tissue antioxidant glutathione - in an animal model of depression and in ex vivo assays to detect oxidative stress parameters. Imipramine (IMI), a classical and clinically-approved antidepressant drug was also under investigation. Male Wistar rats which underwent either bulbectomy (BULB; removal of the olfactory bulbs) or sham surgery (SHAM; olfactory bulbs were left undestroyed) were treated acutely or repeatedly with NAC (50-100mg/kg, ip) or IMI (10mg/kg, ip). Following 10-daily injections with NAC or IMI or their solvents, or 9-daily injections with a corresponding solvent plus acute NAC or acute IMI forced swimming test on day 10, and locomotor activity were performed; immediately after behavioral tests animals were decapitated. Biochemical tests (the total antioxidant capacity - TAC and the superoxide dismutase activity - SOD) were performed on homogenates in several brain structures. In behavioral studies, chronic (but not acute) administration of NAC resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the immobility time seen only in BULB rats while chronic IMI produced a significant decrease in this parameter in both SHAM and BULB animals. On the other hand, chronic administration of NAC and IMI resulted in a significant increase in cellular antioxidant mechanisms (SOD activity) that reversed the effects of BULB in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. Our study further supports the antidepressant-like activity of NAC and links its effect as well as IMI actions with the enhancement of brain SOD activity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Smaga I ; Pomierny B ; Krzyżanowska W ; Pomierny-Chamioło L ; Miszkiel J ; Niedzielska E ; Ogórka A ; Filip M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2012.06.018 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAntioxidants/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBrain/drug effects/metabolism\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nImipramine/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nImmobility Response, Tonic/drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMotor Activity/drug effects\r\nOlfactory Bulb/surgery\r\nOxidation-Reduction/drug effects\r\nOxidative Stress/*drug effects\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nSuperoxide Dismutase/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Smaga I, Pomierny B, Krzyżanowska W, Pomierny-Chamioło L, Miszkiel J, Niedzielska E, Ogórka A, and Filip M (2012) N-acetylcysteine possesses antidepressant-like activity through reduction of oxidative stress: behavioral and biochemical analyses in rats..

METHODS: In a randomized controlled clinical trial, 37 patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder were treated with L-tryptophan 6 g per day, and 34 were given placebo. The treatments were administered under double-blind conditions for 17 days, from the time of ovulation to the third day of menstruation, during three consecutive menstrual cycles. RESULTS: The Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) revealed a significant (p = .004) therapeutic effect of L-tryptophan relative to placebo for the cluster of mood symptoms comprising the items of dysphoria, mood swings, tension, and irritability. The magnitude of the reduction from baseline in maximum luteal phase VAS-mood scores was 34.5% with L-tryptophan compared to 10.4% with placebo.

Tryptophan represents a key element for brain functioning, because of its role as a precursor for production of neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine). In clinical conditions, which involve chronic immune system activation or under cytokine therapy, lower tryptophan levels because of high catabolism of tryptophan as indicated by the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio are common and often associate with depressive mood. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies in the in vitro model of mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed that several phytocompounds, mainly antioxidants like polyphenols and vitamins, can interfere with inflammatory signaling cascades including tryptophan breakdown. If extrapolated to the in vivo situation, such compounds could increase blood and brain tryptophan availability for serotonin production. Although there is some in vivo evidence for the effect of such compounds, outcomes are hardly predictable and most likely depend on the individual's immunological state. SUMMARY: Not only a diet rich in tryptophan but also a diet rich in antioxidants can have a positive impact on mood and cognition. This could be of special relevance for individuals who present with low grade inflammation conditions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Strasser B ; Gostner JM ; Fuchs D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/MCO.0000000000000237 ","Keywords":"*Affect\r\nAntioxidants/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nBrain/drug effects\r\n*Cognition\r\nCognition Disorders/*metabolism/prevention & control\r\nDepression/*metabolism/prevention & control\r\n*Diet\r\nFeeding Behavior\r\nHumans\r\nSerotonin/*metabolism\r\nTryptophan/*metabolism/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Strasser B, Gostner JM, and Fuchs D (2016) Mood, food, and cognition: role of tryptophan and serotonin..

Since SAM-e is involved in several metabolic processes, its administration may have a role in the amelioration of several disorders. In addition, SAM-e increases catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme activity, which may ameliorate aggressive symptoms in certain patients. We have therefore investigated the efficacy of SAM-e in managing schizophrenia symptomatology in patients with the low activity COMT polymorphism. Eighteen patients with chronic schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive either SAM-e (800 mg) or placebo for 8 weeks in double-blind fashion. Results indicated some reduction in aggressive behavior and improved quality of life following SAM-e administration. Female patients showed improvement of depressive symptoms. Clinical improvement did not correlate with serum SAM-e levels. Two patients receiving SAM-e exhibited some exacerbation of irritability. This preliminary pilot short-term study cautiously supports SAM-e as an adjunct in management of aggressive behavior and quality of life impairment in schizophrenia.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Strous RD ; Ritsner MS ; Adler S ; Ratner Y ; Maayan R ; Kotler M ; Lachman H ; Weizman A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.euroneuro.2008.08.004 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAggression/*drug effects/*psychology\r\nCognition/drug effects\r\nDepression/etiology/psychology\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDopamine/metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nGenotype\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNeuropsychological Tests\r\nNorepinephrine/metabolism\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nPsychomotor Performance/drug effects\r\nQuality of Life/*psychology\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use\r\nSchizophrenia/*drug therapy\r\n*Schizophrenic Psychology\r\nSex Characteristics\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Strous RD, Ritsner MS, Adler S, Ratner Y, Maayan R, Kotler M, Lachman H, and Weizman A (2009) Improvement of aggressive behavior and quality of life impairment following S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM-e) augmentation in schizophrenia..

Alternative adjunct treatments, including nutritional therapies, may have the potential to alleviate residual symptoms and improve the outcomes of standard pharmacotherapy. The aim of this paper is to critically review the current clinical evidence and mechanisms of action of nutrient-based therapies alone or in combination with commonly used pharmacotherapies for mania and bipolar depression. METHODS: We conducted a Medline search for clinical trials conducted with humans, published in English from 1960 to 2012 using nutritional supplements such as n-3, chromium, inositol, choline, magnesium, folate and tryptophan alone or in combination with pharmacotherapies for the treatment of bipolar disorder. RESULTS: Preliminary data yields conflicting but mainly positive evidence for the use of n-3 fatty acids and chromium in the treatment of bipolar depression. Limited evidence found that inositol may be helpful for bipolar depression, but larger sample sizes are needed. Preliminary randomized, controlled trials suggest that choline, magnesium, folate and tryptophan may be beneficial for reducing symptoms of mania. CONCLUSIONS: Given the potential public health impact of identifying adjunct treatments that improve psychiatric as well as physical health outcomes, nutritional treatments appear promising for the management of bipolar disorder but require further study.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sylvia LG ; Peters AT ; Deckersbach T ; Nierenberg AA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000341309 ","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nCholine/therapeutic use\r\nChromium/therapeutic use\r\n*Dietary Supplements\r\nFatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use\r\nFolic Acid/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nInositol/therapeutic use\r\nLipotropic Agents/therapeutic use\r\nMagnesium/therapeutic use\r\nTrace Elements/therapeutic use\r\nTryptophan/therapeutic use\r\nVitamin B Complex/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sylvia LG, Peters AT, Deckersbach T, and Nierenberg AA (2013) Nutrient-based therapies for bipolar disorder: a systematic review..

A relatively small dose, 150 mg orally for seven days, was employed, and seven of 14 patients responded to the treatment with mild or moderate amelioration of their depressive symptoms. Urinary excretion levels and plasma concentrations of three 5-hydroxyindole compounds, 5-HTP, 5-HT and 5-HIAA, were measured during the drug treatment. Approximately 70% of the orally administered dose of L-5-HTP was recovered from the urine of depressed patients. Major part of urinary indoleamine metabolites was free and conjugate 5-HIAA. Excretion levels of these compounds in urine were not consistently altered in the depressed patients as compared to those in normal subjects. Clinical response to L-5-HTP treatment appeared to have some correlation with the biochemical measures in the depressed patients, that is, non-responders exhibited significantly lower excretion levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in urine, and lower plasma levels of 5-HT than responders.

There were 234 eligible subjects randomized to either MSI-195 (n = 118) or placebo (n = 116). There were no overall statistically significant differences found between MSI-195 added to ongoing ADT compared to placebo on any of 3 depression-rating instruments (HamD(17), MADRS, IDS-SR(30)) in the ITT set. MSI-195 was generally safe and well tolerated with predominantly mild gastrointestinal side effects. Post-hoc analyses examined factors that might have affected study outcome. The ITT set was divided into subjects enrolled during the 1st half (first nine months) and 2nd half of the study. MSI-195 added to ongoing ADT was significantly better than placebo on both the HamD(17) and MADRS in the 1st half (p = 0.03 and 0.02 respectively), but not in the 2nd half of the study. Several demographic and clinical characteristics were significantly different between the two study segments including body mass index, pre-randomization symptom severity fluctuation, number of lifetime depressive episodes, and anxious depression sub-type. Thus, the characteristics of the enrolled subjects changed between the 1st and 2nd half of the study. These post-hoc findings highlight the inherent challenges encountered for subject selection in double-blind, placebo controlled trials and compel further investigation of enrollment criteria and moderating factors that affect treatment. The favorable safety profile and clinical benefit observed with MSI-195 in the 1st half of this study warrant further investigation in MDD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Targum SD ; Cameron BR ; Ferreira L ; MacDonald ID ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2018.10.010 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nBody Mass Index\r\nDepressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Synergism\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Outcome Assessment, Health Care\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nAugmentation treatment\r\nBody mass index\r\nMajor depressive disorder\r\nModerating factors\r\nS-adenosylmethionine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Targum SD, Cameron BR, Ferreira L, and MacDonald ID (2018) An augmentation study of MSI-195 (S-adenosylmethionine) in Major Depressive Disorder..

The goals of this study are to analyze the changes in quality components of green tea during anaerobic treatment, and to investigate whether or not the extract of GABA present in green tea can prevent depression or improve the depressive state of animals. Results showed that GABA content in green tea had increased significantly after anaerobic treatment. The contents of tea polysaccharides, total free amino acids, and water extracts were also increased whereas tea polyphenols were reduced. More importantly, the extract of GABA green tea could alleviate mouse depression and stress from desperate environments through the forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), mRNA and protein expression levels of GABA(A) receptors. Therefore, these results indicate that GABA green tea may have a health effect on prevention and alleviation of depression, and it works on the GABAergic neurotransmission of mouse cerebral cortex via up-regulating expression of the GABA(A) receptor α1 subunit, thus ameliorating depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Teng J ; Zhou W ; Zeng Z ; Zhao W ; Huang Y ; Zhang X ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1039/c7fo01045a ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage/chemistry\r\nCamellia sinensis/*chemistry\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFemale\r\nHindlimb Suspension\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nPlant Extracts/*administration & dosage/chemistry\r\nTea/chemistry\r\ngamma-Aminobutyric Acid/*administration & dosage/chemistry","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Teng J, Zhou W, Zeng Z, Zhao W, Huang Y, and Zhang X (2017) Quality components and antidepressant-like effects of GABA green tea..

Novel treatment approaches that target clinical and cognitive aspects of bipolar depression are needed, and research on pathophysiology suggests that mitochondrial modulators such as the nutraceutical creatine monohydrate might have a therapeutic role for this condition. METHODS: Eighteen (N=18) patients with bipolar depression according to DSM-IV criteria who were enrollled in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of creatine monohydrate 6g daily as adjunctive therapy were submitted to neuropsychological assessments (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition, Stroop Color-Word Test, Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test, FAS Verbal Fluency Test) at baseline and week 6. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the treatment groups of the change on the total scores after 6 weeks in the verbal fluency test, with improvement in the group receiving adjunctive treatment with creatine. We did not find significant differences between the groups of the changes on other neuropsychological tests. LIMITATIONS: Small sample and lack of a control group of healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our trial, which was the first to investigate the cognitive effects of creatine monohydrate on bipolar depression, indicates that supplementation with this nutraceutical for 6 weeks is associated with improvement in verbal fluency tests in patients with this condition.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Toniolo RA ; Fernandes FBF ; Silva M ; Dias RDS ; Lafer B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2016.11.029 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nCognition\r\nCognitive Dysfunction/drug therapy\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nCreatine/*therapeutic use\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNeuropsychological Tests\r\nAdjunctive therapy\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nCognition\r\nCreatine monohydrate\r\nDepression\r\nRandomized controlled trial","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Toniolo RA, Fernandes FBF, Silva M, Dias RDS, and Lafer B (2017) Cognitive effects of creatine monohydrate adjunctive therapy in patients with bipolar depression: Results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial..

Currently available treatments for this condition have limited efficacy and new therapeutic options are needed. Extensive research in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder points to the existence of mitochondrial and bioenergetic dysfunction. We hypothesized that creatine monohydrate, a nutraceutical that works as a mitochondrial modulator, would be effective as an adjunctive therapy for bipolar depression. We conducted a double-blind trial in which 35 patients with bipolar disorder type I or II in a depressive episode by DSM-IV criteria and in use of regular medication for the treatment of this phase of the disease were randomly allocated into two adjunctive treatment groups for 6 weeks: creatine monohydrate 6 g daily (N = 17) or placebo (N = 18). Primary efficacy was assessed by the change in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). We did not find a statistically significant difference in the comparison between groups for the change in score on the MADRS after 6 weeks in an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (p = 0.560; Cohen's d = 0.231). However, we found significant superiority of creatine add-on vs. placebo when we considered the remission criterion of a MADRS score ≤ 12 at week 6 analyzing the outcome of the 35 randomized patients on ITT (52.9% remission in the creatine group vs. 11.1% remission in the placebo group) and of the 23 completers (66.7% remission in the creatine group vs. 18.2% remission in the placebo group) (p = 0.012; OR = 9.0 and p = 0.036; OR = 9.0, respectively). Two patients who received creatine switched to hypomania/mania early in the trial. No clinically relevant physical side-effects were reported or observed. This proof-of-concept study, aiming to restore brain bioenergetics using an adjunctive mitochondrial modulator, is not conclusive on the efficacy of creatine add-on for bipolar depression, but suggests that this compound may have a role in the adjunctive treatment of this phase of the illness. Further investigation through randomized controlled trials with larger samples should be conducted to verify the efficacy of creatine supplementation for bipolar depression and also for subsyndromal depressive symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Toniolo RA ; Silva M ; Fernandes FBF ; Amaral JAMS ; Dias RDS ; Lafer B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00702-017-1817-5 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAntioxidants/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nCreatine/*therapeutic use\r\nDietary Supplements\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nHumans\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nProof of Concept Study\r\nAdjunctive therapy\r\nBipolar disorder\r\nCreatine monohydrate\r\nDepression\r\nDouble-blind method\r\nRandomized controlled trial","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Toniolo RA, Silva M, Fernandes FBF, Amaral JAMS, Dias RDS, and Lafer B (2018) A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trial of creatine monohydrate as adjunctive treatment for bipolar depression..

This study investigated the effects of TRP, vitamin B(6), and nicotinamide-containing supplements loading between meals on mood and ANS activity in depressive young adults. Thirty depressive young adults were randomly allocated to receive TRP, vitamin B(6), and nicotinamide-containing supplements or a placebo supplements twice daily between meals for 7 d. Mood was measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). ANS activities were analyzed by heart rate variability power spectral analysis. Blood samples were assayed for plasma total TRP concentration. For analysis, TRP and placebo groups were further classified into two subgroups according to CES-D score (mild to moderate vs. severe depressive symptoms). The CES-D score significantly improved following both treatments in the severe depression subgroups, while the POMS depression score was significantly improved only in the TRP severe depression subgroup. There was no significant change in ANS activity or plasma total TRP in any group.

Unfortunately, depression is a common side effect of IFN therapy, affecting approximately a third of HCV patients receiving IFN therapy. Studies have shown that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can effectively treat IFN-induced depression in only 63-75% of cases. For the remaining percentage, depression often necessitates dose reduction of or discontinuation from IFN therapy. Emerging evidence indicates that IFN may cause depression by affecting brain serotonin. IFN has been shown to increase serotonin reuptake and to decrease serotonin synthesis. We hypothesize that SSRIs are not fully effective because they affect only serotonin reuptake, not serotonin synthesis, and that effective treatment must address both uptake and synthesis. 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) effectively increases central nervous system synthesis of serotonin. It is the immediate precursor of serotonin and is widely available as a dietary supplement, which is well absorbed after an oral dose.

In the absence of supplementation with exogenous 5-HTP, the amount of endogenous 5-HTP available for serotonin synthesis depends on the availability of tryptophan and on the activity of various enzymes, especially tryptophan hydroxylase, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). Factors affecting each of these are reviewed. The amount of 5-HTP reaching the central nervous system (CNS) is affected by the extent to which 5-HTP is converted to serotonin in the periphery. This conversion is controlled by the enzyme amino acid decarboxylase, which, in the periphery, can be blocked by peripheral decarboxylase inhibitors (PDIs) such as carbidopa. Preclinical and clinical evidence for the efficacy of 5-HTP for depression is reviewed, with emphasis on double-blind, placebo-controlled (DB-PC) trials. Safety issues with 5-HTP are also reviewed, with emphasis on eosinophilia myalgia syndrome (EMS) and serotonin syndrome.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Turner EH ; Loftis JM ; Blackwell AD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pharmthera.2005.06.004 ","Keywords":"5-Hydroxytryptophan/*therapeutic use\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nSerotonin/metabolism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Turner EH, Loftis JM, and Blackwell AD (2006) Serotonin a la carte: supplementation with the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan..

METHODS: 91 young volunteers (age: 21 ± 2 yrs) and 127 above 50 years old (58 ± 6 yrs) healthy volunteers completed the study. Participants from the placebo and tryptophan group followed the same protocol. Before starting the study blood samples, to measure serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and rs25531 polymorphisms, were collected. In addition, before and after completing the study urine samples (to measure 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) were taken, while psychological questionnaires (to assess depression and social cognition levels), and a one week dietary record (to calculate the tryptophan (TRP) intake) were assessed. RESULTS: The triallelic approach of SLC6A4 showed that in S'S´ subjects there was a positive correlation between TRP intake and 5-HIAA levels. Age of participants, SLC6A4 genotype, and experimental condition were important factors contributing to the outcome of depression and social cognition. CONCLUSIONS: 5-HTTLPR and rs25531 polymorphisms play a key role in the response to the TRP- based nutritional intervention, improving only age-related depressive symptoms and empathy in S'S´ subjects who have a higher risk to show signs of depression during their lifetime.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ugartemendia L ; Bravo R ; Reuter M ; Castaño MY ; Plieger T ; Zamoscik V ; Kirsch P ; Rodríguez AB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.clnu.2021.02.023 ","Keywords":"Age Factors\r\nAlleles\r\nDepression/*diet therapy/genetics\r\nDiet/*methods/psychology\r\nDiet Surveys\r\nEating/genetics/psychology\r\nEmpathy\r\nFemale\r\nGenetic Association Studies\r\nGenetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics\r\nGenotype\r\nHealthy Volunteers\r\nHumans\r\nHydroxyindoleacetic Acid/urine\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNutritional Physiological Phenomena/genetics\r\nPolymorphism, Genetic\r\nPsychological Tests\r\nSerotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics\r\nSingle-Blind Method\r\n*Social Cognition\r\nTryptophan/*administration & dosage\r\nYoung Adult\r\n5-HIAA\r\nDepression\r\nNutritional intervention\r\nSERT\r\nSocial cognition\r\nTryptophan","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ugartemendia L, Bravo R, Reuter M, Castaño MY, Plieger T, Zamoscik V, Kirsch P, and Rodríguez AB (2021) SLC6A4 polymorphisms modulate the efficacy of a tryptophan-enriched diet on age-related depression and social cognition..

Subthreshold depression (SD) is a form of subclinical depression with increased risk of major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients diagnosed with SD may not be eligible for antidepressant drugs and, particularly in the case of MDD, these antidepressants may have adverse effects which outweigh their therapeutic effects, leading to discontinuation of therapy. Food supplements could provide an alternative strategy. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of a food supplement based on a combination of S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe, 200 mg/day) and probiotics (Lactobacillus helveticus Rosell®-52, Bifidobacterium longum Rosell®-175, 3 ×10(9) CFU/day) in reducing depression symptoms in a monocentric, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over clinical trial. 80 Subjects were recruited and offered the food supplement or placebo daily for three months, according to a cross-over clinical trial design, followed by a six-week follow-up period. The efficacy of the food supplement was measured by means of the \"Hamilton Depression Rating Scale\" (HAM-D) and \"Patient Health Questionnaire-9\" (PHQ-9), using a mixed analysis of variance model, with random intercept, for statistical analysis. The food supplement showed a significant decrease of PHQ-9 and HAM-D scores resulting in reduced SD and MDD symptoms as compared to placebo. In conclusion, the daily intake of the food supplement based on SAMe and probiotic strains for a period of three months is effective in improving the quality of life of SD subjects who are not eligible for antidepressant therapies, and patients suffering from mild-to-moderate depression who are not sensitive or cannot tolerate conventional drugs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ullah H ; Di Minno A ; Esposito C ; El-Seedi HR ; Khalifa SAM ; Baldi A ; Greco A ; Santonastaso S ; Cioffi V ; Sperandeo R ; Sacchi R ; Daglia M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopha.2022.113930 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nQuality of Life\r\nDietary Supplements\r\n*Probiotics/adverse effects\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/therapeutic use\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFood supplement\r\nMild-to-moderate depression\r\nProbiotics\r\nS-adenosylmethionine\r\nSubthreshold depression","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ullah H, Di Minno A, Esposito C, El-Seedi HR, Khalifa SAM, Baldi A, Greco A, Santonastaso S, Cioffi V, Sperandeo R, Sacchi R, and Daglia M (2022) Efficacy of a food supplement based on S-adenosyl methionine and probiotic strains in subjects with subthreshold depression and mild-to-moderate depression: A monocentric, randomized, cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial..

Suicidal ideation more frequently occurs in people with moderate to severe depression. Psychotherapy and pharmacological drugs are the mainstay of available treatment options for depressive disorders. However, pharmacological options do not offer complete cure, especially in moderate to severe depression, and are often seen with a range of adverse events. S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) supplementation has been widely studied, and an impressive collection of literature published over the last few decades suggests its antidepressant efficacy. Probiotics have gained significant attention due to their wide array of clinical uses, and multiple studies have explored the link between probiotic species and mood disorders. Gut dysbiosis is one of the risk factors in depression by inducing systemic inflammation accompanied by an imbalance in neurotransmitter production. Thus, concomitant administration of probiotics may be an effective treatment strategy in patients with depressed mood, particularly in resistant cases, as these can aid in dysbiosis, possibly resulting in the attenuation of systemic inflammatory processes and the improvement of the therapeutic efficacy of SAMe. The current review highlights the therapeutic roles of SAMe and probiotics in depression, their mechanistic targets, and their possible synergistic effects and may help in the development of food supplements consisting of a combination of SAMe and probiotics with new dosage forms that may improve their bioavailability.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ullah H ; Khan A ; Rengasamy KRR ; Di Minno A ; Sacchi R ; Daglia M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu14132751 ","Keywords":"Depression/drug therapy\r\nDietary Supplements\r\n*Dysbiosis/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\n*Probiotics/therapeutic use\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/therapeutic use\r\nS-adenosyl methionine\r\ndepression\r\ngut dysbiosis\r\nprobiotics\r\nsynergistic effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ullah H, Khan A, Rengasamy KRR, Di Minno A, Sacchi R, and Daglia M (2022) The Efficacy of S-Adenosyl Methionine and Probiotic Supplementation on Depression: A Synergistic Approach..

That is, two male mice were separately housed in the same cage with a partition for establishing the territorial imperative in each mouse. Then, the partition was removed and mice were co-housed confrontationally (confront-housing) using a model mouse of accelerated-senescence (SAMP10) that exhibited cerebral atrophy and cognitive dysfunction with ageing. It was found that mice began to die earlier under confront-housing than group-housed control mice. Additionally, it was found that cerebral atrophy, learning impairment and behavioural depression were higher in mice under the stressed condition of confront-housing than age-matched mice under group-housing. Furthermore, the level of oxidative damage in cerebral DNA was higher in mice housed confrontationally than group-housed control mice. On the other hand, the consumption of purified theanine (20 μg/ml, 5-6 mg/kg) suppressed the shortened lifespan, cerebral atrophy, learning impairment, behavioural depression and oxidative damage in cerebral DNA. These results suggest that psychosocial stress accelerates age-related alterations such as oxidative damage, lifespan, cognitive dysfunction and behavioural depression. The intake of theanine might be a potential candidate for suppression of disadvantage under psychosocial stress.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Unno K ; Fujitani K ; Takamori N ; Takabayashi F ; Maeda K ; Miyazaki H ; Tanida N ; Iguchi K ; Shimoi K ; Hoshino M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3109/10715762.2011.566869 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nChronic Disease\r\nCognition Disorders/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nCorticosterone/blood\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/etiology\r\nGlutamates/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nLongevity/*drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred Strains\r\nStress, Psychological/*complications","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Unno K, Fujitani K, Takamori N, Takabayashi F, Maeda K, Miyazaki H, Tanida N, Iguchi K, Shimoi K, and Hoshino M (2011) Theanine intake improves the shortened lifespan, cognitive dysfunction and behavioural depression that are induced by chronic psychosocial stress in mice..

Stress sensitivity was higher in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 10 (SAMP10) mice than in normal ddY mice when these mice were loaded with stress on the basis of territorial consciousness in males. Group housing was used as the low-stress condition reference. Among the statistically altered metabolites, depression-related kynurenine and excitability-related histamine were significantly higher in SAMP10 mice than in ddY mice. In contrast, carnosine, which has antidepressant-like activity, and ornithine, which has antistress effects, were significantly lower in SAMP10 mice than in ddY mice. The ingestion of theanine, an excellent antistress amino acid, modulated the levels of kynurenine, histamine, and carnosine only in the stress-loaded SAMP10 mice and not in the group-housing mice. Depression-like behavior was suppressed in mice that had ingested theanine only under stress loading. Taken together, changes in these metabolites, such as kynurenine, histamine, carnosine, and ornithine, were suggested to be associated with the stress vulnerability and depression-like behavior of stressed SAMP10 mice. It was also shown that theanine action appears in the metabolism of mice only under stress loading.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Unno K ; Muguruma Y ; Inoue K ; Konishi T ; Taguchi K ; Hasegawa-Ishii S ; Shimada A ; Nakamura Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ijms22010193 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nArginase/metabolism\r\nCamellia sinensis\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nDrug Evaluation, Preclinical\r\nGlutamates/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nHippocampus/*drug effects/metabolism\r\nHistidine Decarboxylase/metabolism\r\nIndoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nPhytotherapy\r\nStress, Psychological/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nTryptophan Oxygenase/metabolism\r\nSAMP10\r\ncarnosine\r\nhistamine\r\nkynurenine\r\nornithine\r\nstress\r\ntheanine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Unno K, Muguruma Y, Inoue K, Konishi T, Taguchi K, Hasegawa-Ishii S, Shimada A, and Nakamura Y (2020) Theanine, Antistress Amino Acid in Tea Leaves, Causes Hippocampal Metabolic Changes and Antidepressant Effects in Stress-Loaded Mice..

In particular, major depressive disorder is expected to have a worldwide prevalence of 20% in 2020, representing a huge socio-economic burden. Currently used antidepressant drugs have poor efficacy with only 30% of the patients in remission after the first line of treatment. Importantly, mood disorder patients present uncoupling of circadian rhythms. In this regard, melatonin (5-methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine), an indolamine synthesized by the pineal gland during the night, contributes to synchronization of body rhythms with the environmental light/dark cycle. In this review, we describe evidence supporting antidepressant-like actions of melatonin related to the circadian modulation of neuroplastic changes in the hippocampus. We also present evidence for the role of melatonin receptors and their signalling pathways underlying modulatory effects in neuroplasticity. Finally, we briefly discuss the detrimental consequences of circadian disruption on neuroplasticity and mood disorders, due to the modern human lifestyle. Together, data suggest that melatonin's stimulation of neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation is beneficial to patients with mood disorders.

Administration of d-amphetamine (d-AMPH) is a relevant animal model of mania and it increases oxidative stress in rat brain. Evidences indicate that the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and Deferoxamine (DFX) exert protective effects in the brain. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of NAC, DFX or their combination on AMPH-induced hyperactivity. The protein oxidation levels were analyzed in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. In the first animal model (reversal treatment), adult male Wistar rats received saline or d-AMPH for 14 days, and from the 8th to the 14th day, they were treated with saline, NAC, DFX, or NAC plus DFX. In the second animal model (prevention treatment), rats were pretreated with saline or antioxidant regime, and from the 8th to the 14th day, they also received saline or d-AMPH. In the prefrontal cortex, the protein carbonyls were not affected by the treatment with antioxidants alone but it was increased by treatment with NAC plus DFX. At the same model, NAC plus DFX reversed the protein damage in the hippocampus, but NAC alone increased this damage. In the prevention treatment, it was observed that the protein damage in the prefrontal cortex was prevented by DFX or NAC plus DFX. In the hippocampus, the pretreatment with all antioxidant regime prevented protein damage induced by d-AMPH. At both treatments (reversal or prevention) the antioxidants did not present any effect against d-AMPH-induced hyperactivity. In conclusion, NAC or DFX and the combination of NAC plus DFX reverse and protect against d-AMPH-induced oxidative protein damage. Using these protocols we could not observe affects on locomotion, however this effect varies depending on the brain region and the treatment regime.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Valvassori SS ; Petronilho FC ; Réus GZ ; Steckert AV ; Oliveira VB ; Boeck CR ; Kapczinski F ; Dal-Pizzol F ; Quevedo J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2008.02.012 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/*pharmacology\r\nAnimals\r\nBipolar Disorder/*chemically induced/*psychology\r\nCentral Nervous System Stimulants/pharmacology\r\nDeferoxamine/*pharmacology\r\nDextroamphetamine/pharmacology\r\nFree Radical Scavengers/*pharmacology\r\nHyperkinesis/*chemically induced/prevention & control/*psychology\r\nMale\r\nOxidative Stress/*drug effects\r\nProtein Carbonylation/drug effects\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Valvassori SS, Petronilho FC, Réus GZ, Steckert AV, Oliveira VB, Boeck CR, Kapczinski F, Dal-Pizzol F, and Quevedo J (2008) Effect of N-acetylcysteine and/or deferoxamine on oxidative stress and hyperactivity in an animal model of mania..

There are strong indications that 5-HTP is of therapeutic value, particularly in the 5-HT-deficient subgroup of vital depressions. In the same subgroup, one controlled study has so far also shown a prophylatic 5-HTP effect. The results of tryptophan studies are less unequivocal, possibly due to pharmacokinetic factors. Another possible explanation might be that, unlike 5-HTP research, tryptophan studies have so far disregarded the patient's serotonergic status. 5-HT research in depressions has also yielded the concept of the biochemical classifiability of depressions.

An alternative hypothesis holds that their action is based on down-regulation of monoaminergic activity (due to decrease in density or sensitivity of certain receptor populations). In this paper the likelihood of both hypotheses is discussed and the conclusion reached that the first one is the most plausible. The following arguments are discussed: (1) the 5-HT precursor 5-HTP, which is transformed to 5-HT in the brain, has antidepressant properties; (2) there are indications that the same holds true for tyrosine, a catecholamine precursor transformed in the brain to DA and NA; and (3) evidence was found that the effects of 5-HTP in depression are potentiated by tyrosine. Since activation rather than suppression of monoaminergic activity seems to be linked to antidepressant activity, it seems likely that the signs of decreased monoamine metabolism that have been demonstrated in certain types of depression are the expression of a primary metabolic deficit rather than a phenomenon secondary to receptor hypersensitivity. Further clinical studies of 5-HT/CA precursor combinations in depression are justified.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"van Praag HM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/0028-3908(83)90193-4 ","Keywords":"5-Hydroxytryptophan/*pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nAdult\r\nAntidepressive Agents/*pharmacology\r\nBiogenic Amines/analysis/metabolism\r\nBrain Chemistry\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nReceptors, Adrenergic, beta/drug effects\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nTyrosine/*pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"van Praag HM (1983) In search of the mode of action of antidepressants. 5-HTP/tyrosine mixtures in depressions..

On the other hand, the ratings for retardation decreased about equally in both groups during the three-week treatment period. Side-effect ratings showed no significant increase but seemed to be partly influenced by the improvement of depressive symptoms. Plasma levels of clomipramine appeared to reach a plateau within a few days, whereas the monodesmethylated metabolite continued to rise for a longer period of time, and reached considerably higher values than the parent compound. In the tryptophan group the degree of improvement seemed to be positively correlated to these levels, suggesting that further improvement might have been reached in some patients by increasing the dose of clomipramine.

Circulating kynurenine is transported into the brain by the large amino transporter LAT1 at the level of the blood-brain barrier. We hypothesized that administration of leucine that has a high affinity for LAT1 should prevent the entry of kynurenine into the brain and attenuate the formation of neurotoxic kynurenine metabolites. To test whether leucine could prevent inflammation-induced depression-like behavior, mice were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.83 mg/kg IP) or saline and treated with L-leucine (50 mg/kg, IP) or vehicle administered before and 6 h after LPS. Depression-like behavior was measured by increased duration of immobility in the forced swim test and decreased sucrose preference. Leucine decreased brain kynurenine levels, blocked LPS-induced depression-like behavior and had antidepressant-like effects in control mice. Leucine had no effect of its own on sickness behavior and neuroinflammation. To confirm that leucine acts by interfering with the transport of kynurenine into the brain, mice were injected with L-leucine (300 mg/kg, IP) immediately before kynurenine (33 mg/kg IP) and brain kynurenine and depression-like behavior were measured 3 h later. Leucine did prevent the entry of exogenous kynurenine into the brain and abrogated depression-like behavior measured by increased duration of immobility in the forced swim test. Additional experiments using an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier confirmed that kynurenine competes with leucine at the level of the amino acid transporter LAT1 for brain uptake. These experiments also revealed that efflux was the dominant direction of kynurenine transport and was largely independent of LAT1 and leucine, which explains why leucine could block brain uptake of kynurenine without affecting brain clearance. These findings demonstrate that leucine has antidepressant properties vis-à-vis inflammation-induced depression and one mechanism for this is by blocking the ability of kynurenine to enter the brain.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Walker AK ; Wing EE ; Banks WA ; Dantzer R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41380-018-0076-7 ","Keywords":"Amino Acid Transport System y+L/metabolism\r\nAnimals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/pharmacology\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nBlood-Brain Barrier/metabolism\r\nBrain/metabolism\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDepressive Disorder/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nHippocampus/metabolism\r\nIndoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/metabolism\r\nKynurenine/metabolism\r\nLeucine/metabolism/*pharmacology\r\nLipopolysaccharides/pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMice\r\nMice, Inbred C57BL","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Walker AK, Wing EE, Banks WA, and Dantzer R (2019) Leucine competes with kynurenine for blood-to-brain transport and prevents lipopolysaccharide-induced depression-like behavior in mice..

Interestingly, both types of glutamatergic modulators, NMDAR enhancers and blockers, can improve depression through common targets, namely alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionaic acid receptors (AMPARs) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). To elucidate the cellular signaling pathway underlying this counterintuitive observation, we activated NMDARs in rats by using d-serine. Saline, ketamine (NMDAR antagonist), and desipramine (tricyclic antidepressant) were used as controls. The antidepressant-like effects of all agents were evaluated using the forced swim test. The activation of the AMPAR-mTOR signaling pathway, release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and alteration of AMPAR and NMDAR trafficking in the hippocampus of rats were examined. A single high dose of d-serine exerted an antidepressant-like effect that was mediated by rapid AMPAR-induced mTOR signaling pathway and increased BDNF proteins, identical to that of ketamine. Furthermore, in addition to the increased protein kinase A phosphorylation of the AMPAR subunit GluR1 (an indicator of AMPAR insertion in neurons), treatment with individual optimal doses of d-serine and ketamine also increased adaptin β2-NMDAR association (an indicator of the intracellular endocytic machinery and subsequent internalization of NMDARs). Desipramine did not influence these processes. Our study is the first to demonstrate an association between d-serine and ketamine; following adaptative regulation of AMPAR and NMDAR may lead to common changes of them. These findings provide novel targets for safer antidepressant agents with mechanisms similar to those of ketamine.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wei IH ; Chen KT ; Tsai MH ; Wu CH ; Lane HY ; Huang CC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1021/acs.jafc.7b04217 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nApoptosis\r\nBrain/metabolism\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism\r\nCyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nHippocampus/drug effects\r\nHumans\r\nKetamine/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nKidney/metabolism\r\nLiver/metabolism\r\nMale\r\nNeurons/drug effects/metabolism\r\nPhosphorylation\r\nRats\r\nRats, Wistar\r\nReceptors, Glutamate/metabolism\r\nReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/metabolism\r\nSerine/administration & dosage/*chemistry/*pharmacology\r\nSwimming\r\nAMPA\r\nNMDA\r\namino acid\r\nd-serine\r\ndepression\r\nketamine\r\ntrafficking","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wei IH, Chen KT, Tsai MH, Wu CH, Lane HY, and Huang CC (2017) Acute Amino Acid d-Serine Administration, Similar to Ketamine, Produces Antidepressant-like Effects through Identical Mechanisms..

METHODS: Searches of Medline, Psychinfo, AMED, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were conducted from database inception through September 2001. Randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, intervention studies, case-control studies, reviews, and case reports examining the evidence behind S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) supplementation in depression among humans were selected. No limits were placed on study populations for demographics or co-morbidities. Only English language papers were abstracted and assessed for trial quality. Two abstractors independently evaluated each study, and then reconciled findings. As data were available, between group treatment effect size was noted or, as needed, calculated. RESULTS: Eleven articles met initial inclusion criteria; five intervention trials, two RCTs, two reviews, one controlled clinical trial, and one meta-analysis. Using the one common outcome measure among all the intervention studies and RCTs, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, direct comparison of effect sizes was made. A favourable and significant between group effect was seen. CONCLUSION: All of the studies reviewed were short term, making translation to the clinical setting difficult. However, there appears to be a role for SAMe in the treatment of major depression in adults. Questions remain about mechanism of action, bioavailability, and absorption of oral SAMe. Further study of SAMe as independent and adjuvant therapy for major depression in adults is indicated.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Williams AL ; Girard C ; Jui D ; Sabina A ; Katz DL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Clinical Trials as Topic\r\nDatabases, Bibliographic\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nS-Adenosylmethionine/*pharmacology\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Williams AL, Girard C, Jui D, Sabina A, and Katz DL (2005) S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) as treatment for depression: a systematic review..

Indoleamine precursors predominantly cause mood changes. However, the efficacy of these amino acids as antidepressants has been neither clearly established nor refuted, probably due to insufficient consideration of the following criteria; sufficiently high plasma levels to be taken up into the brain, effective stimulation of serotoninergic systems, and selective increase of serotonin turnover with minimal interaction with other neurotransmitters. The use of intravenous L-5HTP as a provocative test in depressive patients, with concomitant neuroendocrinological and psychometric measurements, may be a method adequately fulfilling these requirements.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wirz-Justice A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000117607 ","Keywords":"5-Hydroxytryptophan/metabolism/therapeutic use\r\nAmino Acids/*therapeutic use\r\nBipolar Disorder/drug therapy\r\nDepression/*drug therapy\r\nEmotions/*drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLevodopa/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nPhenylalanine/therapeutic use\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\nSex Factors\r\nTryptophan/metabolism/therapeutic use\r\nTyrosine/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wirz-Justice A (1977) Theoretical and therapeutic potential of indolamine precursors in affective disorders..

Single-dose TRP caused an antidepressant-like effect dose dependently up to 125 mg/kg. No significant effect was observed, however, when the TRP dose was increased to 250 mg/kg, i.e. a reversal of effect occurred at high dose. With p-CPA pretreatment, the effects observed at 125 and 250 mg/kg TRP were similar to those obtained at 50 and 125 mg/kg without p-CPA pretreatment, respectively. Melatonin also caused an antidepressant-like effect in a similar manner, but appeared to be less potent than TRP. These results strongly indicate that the antidepressant-like effect of TRP was due to its conversion to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). An antianxiety-like effect was observed for TRP only at 250 mg/kg dose together with p-CPA pretreatment, while no sedative effect was observed at all. In contrast, melatonin did not produce any antianxiety-like effect, but produced sedation at 200 mg/kg dose. It may be concluded that the antianxiety-like effect of TRP is unrelated to 5-HT and melatonin formation, but associated with TRP itself or, perhaps, with other anxiolytic metabolites.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wong PT ; Ong YP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000056088 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nAnti-Anxiety Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology\r\nAntidepressive Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology\r\nAnxiety/drug therapy\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nEnzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology\r\nFenclonine/*pharmacology\r\nMale\r\nMelatonin/metabolism/*pharmacology\r\nMice\r\nSerotonin Antagonists/pharmacology\r\nTryptophan/metabolism/*pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wong PT, and Ong YP (2001) Acute antidepressant-like and antianxiety-like effects of tryptophan in mice..

Some of these deficits have been successfully modeled in Nf1 genetically-engineered mice that develop optic gliomas (Nf1 OPG mice). In the current study, we show that abnormal motivational influences affect the behavior of Nf1 OPG mice, particularly with regard to their response to novel environmental stimuli. For example, Nf1 OPG mice made fewer spontaneous alternations in a Y-maze and fewer arm entries relative to WT controls. However, analysis of normalized alternation data demonstrated that these differences were not due to a spatial working memory deficit. Other reported behavioral results (e.g., open-field test, below) suggest that differential responses to novelty and/or other motivational influences may be more important determinants of these kinds of behavior than simple differences in locomotor activity/spontaneous movements. Importantly, normal long-term depression was observed in hippocampal slices from Nf1 OPG mice. Results from elevated plus maze testing showed that differences in exploratory activity between Nf1 OPG and WT control mice may be dependent on the environmental context (e.g., threatening or non-threatening) under which exploration is being measured. Nf1 OPG mice also exhibited decreased exploratory hole poking in a novel holeboard and showed abnormal olfactory preferences, although L-dopa (50 mg/kg) administration resolved the abnormal olfactory preference behaviors. Nf1 OPG mice displayed an attenuated response to a novel open field in terms of decreased ambulatory activity and rearing but only during the first 10 min of the session. Importantly, Nf1 OPG mice demonstrated investigative rearing deficits with regard to a novel hanging object suspended on one side of the field which were not rescued by L-dopa administration. Collectively, our results provide new data important for evaluating therapeutic treatments aimed at ameliorating NF1-associated cognitive/behavioral deficits.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wozniak DF ; Diggs-Andrews KA ; Conyers S ; Yuede CM ; Dearborn JT ; Brown JA ; Tokuda K ; Izumi Y ; Zorumski CF ; Gutmann DH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0066024 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBehavior, Animal/*drug effects\r\nDepression/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology\r\n*Disease Models, Animal\r\nDopamine Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nElectrophysiology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIntegrases/metabolism\r\nLevodopa/*administration & dosage\r\nMale\r\nMaze Learning/drug effects\r\nMemory Disorders/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology\r\nMice\r\nMice, Knockout\r\nMice, Transgenic\r\nMotivation/*drug effects\r\nNeurofibromatosis 1/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism\r\nNeurofibromin 1/*physiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wozniak DF, Diggs-Andrews KA, Conyers S, Yuede CM, Dearborn JT, Brown JA, Tokuda K, Izumi Y, Zorumski CF, and Gutmann DH (2013) Motivational disturbances and effects of L-dopa administration in neurofibromatosis-1 model mice..

Currently approved treatments often pose the risk of serious side effects. Therefore, this study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), in children and adolescents with bipolar spectrum disorder. METHODS: We conducted a 12-week open-label trial of NAC for treatment of mania and hypomania in children and adolescents ages 5-17 with bipolar spectrum disorder including participants with full and subthreshold manic symptoms, accepting those with and without mixed states with co-occurring depression, and Young Mania Rating Scale scores ≥ 20 and < 40. Symptoms of mania and depression were assessed using the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS), and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scales for mania and depression. RESULTS: This study had a high drop-out rate with only 53% completing all 12 weeks. There was a significant reduction in YMRS, HDRS, and CDRS mean scores from baseline to endpoint. Of the 24 exposed participants, 54% had an anti-manic response measured by a reduction in YMRS ≥ 30% and 46% had a CGI-I mania score ≤ 2 at endpoint. Additionally, 62% of participants had an anti-depressive response measured by a reduction in HDRS ≥ 30%, 31% had an anti-depressive response measured by a reduction in CDRS ≥ 30%, and 38% had a CGI-I depression score ≤ 2 at endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: These pilot open-label findings in a small sample provide preliminary data supporting the tolerability and safety of NAC in a pediatric population. The findings of this pilot scale study indicating improvement in mania and depression are promising, but require replication with a monotherapy randomized placebo controlled clinical trial and larger sample.

Synaptic glutamate homeostasis is regulated by cystine-dependent glutamate transporters, including GLT-1 and system x(c)(-) In HD, the enzyme regulating cysteine (and subsequently cystine) production, cystathionine-γ-lygase, has recently been shown to be lowered. The aim of the present study was to establish whether cysteine supplementation, using N-acetylcysteine (NAC) could ameliorate glutamate pathology through the cystine-dependent transporters, system x(c)(-) and GLT-1. We demonstrate that the R6/1 transgenic mouse model of HD has lower basal levels of cystine, and showed depressive-like behaviors in the forced-swim test. Administration of NAC reversed these behaviors. This effect was blocked by co-administration of the system x(c)(-) and GLT-1 inhibitors CPG and DHK, showing that glutamate transporter activity was required for the antidepressant effects of NAC. NAC was also able to specifically increase glutamate in HD mice, in a glutamate transporter-dependent manner. These in vivo changes reflect changes in glutamate transporter protein in HD mice and human HD post-mortem tissue. Furthermore, NAC was able to rescue changes in key glutamate receptor proteins related to excitotoxicity in HD, including NMDAR2B. Thus, we have shown that baseline reductions in cysteine underlie glutamatergic dysfunction and depressive-like behavior in HD and these changes can be rescued by treatment with NAC. These findings have implications for the development of new therapeutic approaches for depressive disorders.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wright DJ ; Gray LJ ; Finkelstein DI ; Crouch PJ ; Pow D ; Pang TY ; Li S ; Smith ZM ; Francis PS ; Renoir T ; Hannan AJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/hmg/ddw144 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/*administration & dosage\r\nAnimals\r\nAutopsy\r\nBehavior, Animal/drug effects\r\nChromosome Pairing/drug effects/genetics\r\nCystathionine gamma-Lyase/biosynthesis/genetics\r\nCystine/biosynthesis\r\nDepression/*drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nExcitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2/biosynthesis/*genetics\r\nGlutamic Acid/genetics/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nHuntington Disease/*drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology\r\nMice\r\nMice, Transgenic\r\nReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/*genetics","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wright DJ, Gray LJ, Finkelstein DI, Crouch PJ, Pow D, Pang TY, Li S, Smith ZM, Francis PS, Renoir T, and Hannan AJ (2016) N-acetylcysteine modulates glutamatergic dysfunction and depressive behavior in Huntington's disease..

A high-yield GABA-producing strain, Lactobacillus brevis J1, from a healthy cow was screened, and its physiological and probiotic properties were evaluated. The effect of adzuki bean sprout fermented milk was investigated in vivo in a chronic depression mouse model. The results showed that Lb. brevis J1 had excellent probiotic properties, grew well at low pH and 3% NaCl, and adhered to the surface of HT-29 cells. The GABA-enriched (241.30 ± 1.62 µg/mL) adzuki bean sprout fermented milk prepared with Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lb. brevis J1 can reduce and possibly prevent mild depression-like symptoms in mice (C57/B6) by increasing social interaction and enhancing the pleasure derived from movement. The research revealed that the GABA(B)-cyclic AMP-protein kinase A-cAMP-response element binding protein (GABA(B)-cAMP-PKA-CREB) signaling pathway was related to the depression-like symptoms and that levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the hippocampus of mice increased after treatment with the adzuki bean sprout fermented milk. Our results suggest that GABA-enriched dairy products have the potential to prevent or treat mild depression-like symptoms in mice, which suggests a new approach for a dietary therapy to treat chronic social stress.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wu Z ; Wang P ; Pan D ; Zeng X ; Guo Y ; Zhao G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2020-19154 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nCattle\r\nDepression/*diet therapy\r\nDisease Models, Animal\r\nFemale\r\nFermentation\r\nLevilactobacillus brevis/metabolism\r\nLactobacillus plantarum/metabolism\r\nMice\r\nMilk/*chemistry/metabolism\r\nProbiotics\r\nStreptococcus thermophilus/metabolism\r\nVigna/*chemistry\r\ngamma-Aminobutyric Acid/metabolism\r\nLactobacillus brevis\r\nVigna angularis\r\nmild depression\r\nγ-aminobutyric acid\r\nγ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-enriched fermented milk","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wu Z, Wang P, Pan D, Zeng X, Guo Y, and Zhao G (2021) Effect of adzuki bean sprout fermented milk enriched in γ-aminobutyric acid on mild depression in a mouse model..

Pyroglutamyl leucine (pyroGlu-Leu, pEL) and pyroglutamyl glutaminyl leucine (pyroGlu-Gln-Leu, pEQL) exhibited antidepressant-like activity in the tail suspension and forced swim tests in mice. pEQL exhibited more potent antidepressant-like activity than pEL after i.p. and i.c.v. administration. pEQL exhibited antidepressant-like activity at a lower dose than Gln-Gln-Leu, suggesting that pyroglutamyl peptide had more potent activity. To examine whether pyroglutamyl peptides increased hippocampus neurogenesis, associated with the effects of antidepressants, we measured 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. pEL and pEQL increased BrdU-positive cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Intriguingly, pEL did not increase hippocampal mRNA and protein expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is a factor associated with both neuropoietic and antidepressive effects. Thus, pyroglutamyl peptides may enhance hippocampal neurogenesis via a pathway independent of BDNF.

Earlier studies with anti-inflammatory drugs have shown benefits in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), but the effects are expected to be higher in patients with increased inflammatory activity. Supplementation of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to ongoing antidepressant therapy may positively influence outcome of depression treatment in these patients. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the efficacy of NAC supplementation in patients with insufficient response to standard antidepressant treatment, and to explore potential roles of inflammation and oxidative stress involved in the alleged pathophysiological processes of TRD. METHODS/DESIGN: A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study comparing NAC versus placebo as add-on medication to antidepressant treatment with 12-week treatment and 8-week follow up in patients with TRD and increased inflammatory activity. Apart from clinical efficacy defined as the change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD)-17 score, secondary outcomes include changes in pathophysiological mechanisms related to depression as well as changes in local brain activity (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, fMRI) and white matter integrity (Diffusion Tensor Imaging, DTI). Importantly, sole patients with CRP levels with values between 0.85 and 10 mg/L will be included. DISCUSSION: This is the first clinical trial taking both TRD and increased inflammatory activity as inclusion criteria. This study will provide reliable evidence for the efficacy of NAC in patients with TRD displaying increased inflammatory activity. And this study also will help explore further the roles of inflammation and oxidative stress involved in the alleged pathophysiological processes of TRD.

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has shown its clinical efficiency in the treatment of several psychiatric disorders and is identified as a multi-target acting drug. The ability of NAC to prevent alcohol abstinence-induced depression-like effects and underlying mechanism(s) have not been adequately addressed. This study was aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of NAC in the alcohol abstinence-induced depression developed following long-term voluntary alcohol intake. For evaluation of the effects of NAC, Sprague-Dawley rats were enabled to voluntary drinking of 4.5%, 7.5% and 9% v/v alcohol for fifteen days. NAC (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) and fluoxetine (5 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally for three consecutive days during the alcohol abstinence period on the days 16, 17, 18. The behavioral studies were conducted employing forced swim test (FST), and tail suspension test (TST) on day 18 to determine the effects of N-acetylcysteine and fluoxetine in the ethanol withdrawal induced-depression. Blood alcohol concentration, alcohol biomarkers like SGPT, SGOT, ALP, GGT, and MCV were estimated by using commercially available kits. Serotonin concentrations were measured in the plasma, hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex using the rat ELISA kit. The expression of GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B genes for the N-methyl d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) subunits in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex were also examined by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results revealed that alcohol abstinence group depicted increased immobility time in FST and TST. Further, NAC exerted significant protective effect at the doses 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, but 25 mg/kg showed insignificant protection against alcohol abstinence-induced depression. The increased level of biochemical parameters following ethanol abstinence were also reversed by NAC at the dose of 100 mg/kg. The significant reversal effect of NAC on the serotonin level following alcohol abstinence was greater in the hippocampus as compared to the third-day alcohol withdrawal group. The increased expression levels of GRIN2A and GRIN2B following ethanol abstinence were reversed with a higher dose of NAC (100 mg/kg) treatment. In conclusion, the results of the study reveal that NAC has remarkable protective effects in the alcohol abstinence-induced depression by modulating alcohol markers, serotonin levels and GRIN2A, GRIN2B gene expression of NMDAR signaling pathway in rats.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yawalkar R ; Changotra H ; Gupta GL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuint.2018.04.011 ","Keywords":"Acetylcysteine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nAlcohol Abstinence/*psychology\r\nAnimals\r\nBrain/drug effects/metabolism\r\nDepression/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/*psychology\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nGene Expression\r\nMale\r\nNeuroprotective Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use\r\nRats\r\nRats, Sprague-Dawley\r\nReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics\r\nSignal Transduction/drug effects/physiology\r\nAlcohol abstinence\r\nAlcohol markers\r\nDepression\r\nGRIN2A\r\nGRIN2B\r\nGene expression\r\nN-acetylcysteine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yawalkar R, Changotra H, and Gupta GL (2018) Protective influences of N-acetylcysteine against alcohol abstinence-induced depression by regulating biochemical and GRIN2A, GRIN2B gene expression of NMDA receptor signaling pathway in rats..

Although it has been suggested that creatine augmentation may involve the restoration of brain energy metabolism, the mechanisms underlying its antidepressant efficacy are unknown. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 52 women with MDD were assigned to receive either creatine augmentation or placebo augmentation of escitalopram; 34 subjects participated in multimodal neuroimaging assessments at baseline and week 8. Age-matched healthy women (n = 39) were also assessed twice at the same intervals. Metabolic and network outcomes were measured for changes in prefrontal N-acetylaspartate and changes in rich club hub connections of the structural brain network using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging, respectively. RESULTS: We found MDD-related metabolic and network dysfunction at baseline. Improvement in depressive symptoms was greater in patients receiving creatine augmentation relative to placebo augmentation. After 8 weeks of treatment, prefrontal N-acetylaspartate levels increased significantly in the creatine augmentation group compared with the placebo augmentation group. Increment in rich club hub connections was also greater in the creatine augmentation group than in the placebo augmentation group.

However, there is no evidence that tryptophan has any clinically significant effect on other treatments such as tricyclic antidepressants and ECT. Side effects of the combination of tryptophan and a monoamine oxidase inhibitors have limited the use of this combination. The risk of the serotonin syndrome is small, but it can occur. However, rapid cessation of tryptophan seems to avoid any long lasting adverse effects of the serotonin syndrome. In situations where enhancement of the therapeutic effect of monamine oxidase inhibitors outweighs the risk of adverse effects, the combination of tryptophan and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is clinically useful. As the studies to date have looked at regular depressed patients, what is needed now is studies of this combination in therapy resistant depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Young SN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nTryptophan/*therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Young SN (1991) Use of tryptophan in combination with other antidepressant treatments: a review..

Lowering of mood after ATD is related to the susceptibility of the study participants to clinical depression, and some participants show no effect on mood. This indicates that low serotonin can contribute to lowered mood, but cannot-by itself-cause lowered mood, unless other unknown systems interact with serotonin to lower mood. Studies using tryptophan supplementation demonstrate that increased serotonin can decrease quarrelsomeness and increase agreeableness in everyday life. Social interactions that are more agreeable and less quarrelsome are associated with better mood. Thus, serotonin may have direct effects on mood, but may also be able to influence mood through changes in social behaviour. The increased agreeableness and decreased quarrelsomeness resulting from increases in serotonin will help foster congenial relations with others and should help to increase social support. As social support and social isolation have an important relationship with both physical and mental health, more research is needed on the implications of the ability of serotonin to modulate social behaviour for the regulation of mood, and for future physical and mental health.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Young SN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2011.0375 ","Keywords":"Affect/*drug effects\r\nAggression/*drug effects\r\nAntidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology\r\nBrain/metabolism\r\nCognition\r\nDepression/drug therapy/physiopathology\r\nHumans\r\nInterpersonal Relations\r\nRecognition, Psychology/drug effects\r\nSerotonin/metabolism\r\n*Social Behavior\r\nSocial Support\r\nTryptophan/administration & dosage/*metabolism/pharmacology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Young SN (2013) The effect of raising and lowering tryptophan levels on human mood and social behaviour..

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of L-lysine as an adjunctive to risperidone in the treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia during an 8-week trial. Seventy-two chronic schizophrenia inpatients with a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score of ≥ 60 participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in the active phase of their disease and underwent 8 weeks of treatment with either L-lysine (6 g/day) or placebo as an adjunctive to risperidone. Patients were evaluated using PANSS and its subscales at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8. The primary outcome measure was to evaluate the efficacy of L-lysine in improving schizophrenia symptoms. Repeated measures analysis demonstrated significant effect for time × treatment interaction on the PANSS total (P < 0.001), negative (P < 0.001) and general psychopathology (P < 0.001) subscale scores but not the PANSS positive subscale scores (P = 0.61). The frequency of adverse events (AEs) did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups and no serious AE was observed. The present study demonstrated that l-lysine can be a tolerable and efficacious adjunctive therapy for improving negative and general psychopathology symptoms in chronic schizophrenia. However, the safety and efficacy of higher doses of l-lysine and longer treatment periods still remain unknown.

The therapeutic efficacy of L-5-HTP was considered as equal to that of traditional antidepressants. There was no difference in efficacy between the two treatments. Best results were obtained in patients with an anxious-agitated depressive syndrome and in patients with an endogenous depression if the illness had been acute. The onset of action was rapid (within 3 or 5 days). Gastrointestinal side effects proved to be dose-dependent and occurred more frequently in patients receiving L-5-HTP alone, whereas psychopathological side effects (especially acute anxiety states) have mainly been reported in patients receiving L-5-HTP in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zmilacher K ; Battegay R ; Gastpar M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000118469 ","Keywords":"5-Hydroxytryptophan/*administration & dosage\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nBenserazide/*administration & dosage\r\nBipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDepressive Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Combinations/administration & dosage\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nHydrazines/*administration & dosage\r\nLevodopa/*administration & dosage\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPsychological Tests\r\nRetrospective Studies","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zmilacher K, Battegay R, and Gastpar M (1988) L-5-hydroxytryptophan alone and in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor in the treatment of depression..
