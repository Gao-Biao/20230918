37. Expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in KGN/shPWRN2 cell lines
(Submitter supplied) In this study, to identify the target genes of PWRN2, we first constructed lentivirus shRNA vectors to infect the KGN cell lines to gain three KGN/shPWRN2 cell lines with down-regulated PWRN2 expression levels. Then, the expression profiles of mRNAs and lncRNAs in KGN/shPWRN2 cells were determined by microarray. The results revealed thousands of lncRNAs and mRNAs expressed in KGN/shPWRN2. The expression of 176 lncRNAs significantly changed in KGN/shPWRN2 cell lines relative to control NC cell lines. more...

38. Profiles for long noncoding RNAs in ovarian granulosa cells from polycystic ovary syndrome patients with different serum concentrations of androgen
(Submitter supplied) Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive system disease, with hyperandrogenism as the core feature. The pathologies remain to be illustrated.  Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been proved to be involved in various biological processes of human diseases. However, there were few reports about the research on lncRNAs in PCOS, not to mention hyperandrogenism.

However, the underlying mechanisms of it remain largely uncertain due to its complexity of clinical manifestations. Since PCOS is believed as a systemic disorder involved endocrine, metabolism, immune system and many organs, we therefore want to know what happen in the peripheral blood of patients with PCOS. more...

It has become increasingly evident that insulin resistance plays a significant role both as a cause and result of the syndrome. In an effort to investigate further the observed insulin resistance in the ovarian tissue of women with PCOS, we conducted array-based, global miRNA profiling.

56. Pathways leading to phosphorylation of p450c17 and to the post-translational regulation of androgen biosynthesis
(Submitter supplied) Cytochrome P450c17 (P450c17) is the single enzyme that catalyzes steroid 17alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20 lyase activities and hence is the crucial decision-making step that determines the class of steroid made in a steroidogenic cell. Although both activities are catalyzed on a single active site, the ratio of these activities is regulated by posttranslational events. Serine phosphorylation of P450c17 increases 17,20 lyase activity by increasing the enzyme's affinity for its redox partner, P450 oxidoreductase. more...

(Submitter supplied) Insulin resistance is a common metabolic abnormality in women with PCOS and leads to an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes. Studies have shown that thiazolidinediones (TZD) improve metabolic disturbances in PCOS patients. We hypothesized that the effect of TZD in PCOS is in part mediated by changes in the transcriptional profile of muscle favoring insulin sensitivity.  Using Affymetrix microarrays, we examined the effect of pioglitazone (30 mg/day for 16 weeks) on gene expression in skeletal muscle of 10 obese women with PCOS metabolically characterized by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. more...

In the present study, we hypothesized that decreased expression of OXPHOS genes could be of similar importance for insulin resistance in the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Using the HG-U133 Plus 2.0 expression array from Affymetrix, we analyzed gene expression in skeletal muscle from obese women with PCOS (n=16) and age- and body mass index-matched control women (n=13) metabolically characterized by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and indirect calorimetry. more...

(Submitter supplied) Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common cause of anovulatory infertility, is characterized by increased ovarian androgen production, arrested follicle development, and is frequently associated with insulin resistance.  These PCOS phenotypes are associated with exaggerated ovarian responsiveness to FSH and increased pregnancy loss.  To examine whether the perturbations in follicle growth and the intrafollicular environment affects development of the mature PCOS oocyte, genes that are differentially expressed in PCOS compared to normal oocytes were defined using microarray analysis. more...

(Submitter supplied) Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic disorder that affects 5-10% of reproductive aged women.  The hallmark characteristic of PCOS is increased ovarian androgen synthesis.  Previous studies by our laboratory demonstrated that increased androgen synthesis is a stable biochemical phenotype of PCOS theca cells which are the primary source of ovarian androgen production.  The increase in theca cell steroidogenesis was due to an increase in expression of several steroidogenic enzymes including CYP17 and CYP11A but not StAR. more...
